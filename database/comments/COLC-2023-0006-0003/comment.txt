In regards to training: a Generative AI is a program which processes images and outputs new images, and not a person who has spent time studying techniques. I think Generative AI is perfectly acceptable when it uses images in its dataset that it has had explicit, informed consent to use.<br/>Recently, the art website DeviantArt introduced an AI trained on images uploaded to their website, including images uploaded long before Generative AI was part of the public zeitgeist. DeviantArt has since reversed to an opt-in model after public backlash.<br/>While I think the opt-in model is much better, there remains an issue with this model; the ability for bad faith actors to reupload other people&#39;s art on small, unmonitored accounts to add otherwise nonconsenting artists&#39; work into a data set, presumably to create art in the style of artists.<br/>As such, I believe that before a Generative AI can be considered to have a non-infringing dataset, it must ensure that its entire dataset is curated, each artist being who they say they are and having made informed consent for their art to be used for training the AI.<br/><br/>As to whether AI Art should be copyrighted; I do not believe that art made whole-cloth of AI should be legally protected.<br/>Copyright, in theory, exists to protect artist&#39;s livelihoods, ensuring that they retain exclusive rights to print or chose who can reprint their art. With this control, an artist may sell their art knowing that no company can simply throw it on a shirt then have that shirt appear in stores across the nation.<br/>And if someone would attempt to put their art on a shirt illegally, they possess the ability to sue the infringing company.<br/>Writing a short prompt and having a program spit out artwork is not an artistic pursuit; it is an act akin to commissioning an artist. In an art commission, the commissioner is not the one who retains copyright; it is the artist. As a machine is not a human being who would need recompense, there is no value is granting it copyright.<br/>AI Artwork does have the potential to be used in a copyright protected work without spoiling the art. For instance, in an interactive digital novel the writer may chose to use AI to generate background art. Or, a movie making a large crowd scene might chose to generate these crowds digitally.<br/>In this regard, the composited scene should be protected by copyright while the individual assets, if obtained by another, should not be protected.<br/>As Generative AI grows in its ability to quickly produce accurate and customized art, reusing assets from other projects will likely be seen pastiche, and with the ease at which new art may be generated there is little reason to copy such work.<br/><br/>With regards to previous technological advances in productivity; a typewriter performs the act of &quot;writing letters&quot; while the words written on a page are of the author&#39;s own mind. One can not copyright the font one uses for a typewriter or on a digital text processor unless one designed the type themselves. Using Times New Roman does not give me copyright over Times New Roman.<br/>Generative AI is unique in its ability to entirely recreate works of art with no human input, though this is not entirely accurate. Just as the font I am writing this comment in was made by a human, so too is the &quot;font&quot; (dataset) the Generative AI used made by a human. However, while this comment was written by a human, the output of a Generative AI is not made by humans.<br/><br/>With regards to a prompt&#39;s copyrightability, I see no way in which a prompt cannot be considered human input. However, I do not believe the output of the prompt to be copyrightable.<br/>If a prompt would instead be posted as an open request on an art website, would that prompt be the copyright of the requester? If so, then the text of that prompt can protected by copyright. However, the resulting art would remain the copyright of the artists even if they based it on another user&#39;s text prompt.
