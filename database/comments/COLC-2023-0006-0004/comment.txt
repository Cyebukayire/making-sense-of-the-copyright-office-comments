There is no intellectual effort involved in the creation of media by AI and so it should not be protected by copyright. However, there is intellectual effort involved in the creation of the AI itself, but I believe that to be irrelevant here.<br/>Another problem is that the AI uses human-made media for training. It is not the same as people drawing inspiration from other media, because humans perceive everything through their own lens and process everything in a meaningful way, while AI will simple take an input and turn it into an output via the algorithm created during training. Evidence of that is AI-generated &quot;fake&quot; signatures that often appear on AI-generated artworks. AI doesn&#39;t have any understanding or actual intelligence to know why these signatures are there or why anything is the way it is. And it is impossible to prove exactly what materials have been used, so people simply hide the fact that they take copyrighted materials. Thus, there is no use in trying to create licenses for training on certain media.<br/>Besides, copyright is meant to protect creations of people. Allowing media generated by means other than human mind to be protected by copyright would allow people to generate an endless stream of media and protect it by copyright for other reasons, ultimately not allowing actual people to create anything freely because everything would be too similar to things that were already generated. This seems unlikely now, but with the rapid growth of AI capabilities it might become possible.
