Hello! I am a young illustrator who works internationally as a freelancer.<br/>Thank you for the opportunity to express my opinion on ai.<br/>This year has been the hardest of all for me. I used to work on sites like fiver or artstation either through stock images or on twitter.<br/>Now it&#39;s very difficult for me to do this. The entire feed is spammed with ai generations, <br/>often people don&#39;t even write that the work was generated by ai.It is difficult for people to find my work among the constant stream of ai.<br/>All AI images were made from the work of other artists, including mine. I made $80 this month. I used to be able to make a living by<br/>painting...now my family advises me to take a job that was offered to me at the factory.<br/>I really love to draw but now I no longer have the opportunity to support my life like that.<br/>On sites like Pinterest and Google, photos are now filled with generated images, which is bad for the search process.<br/>I can no longer find what I was looking for. Many ai works that are currently being sold are sold using the names of the artists they <br/>stole from and uploaded to ai.I do not feel that my copyrights are protected, I feel that all my many years of work can simply be stolen<br/>and used against me in order to deprive me of my work. We need laws and restrictions.
