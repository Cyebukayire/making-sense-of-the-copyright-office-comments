Generative AI is showing to be a powerful tool, and can produce content at a pace and at a quality previously unimaginable. However, these generative AI tools have to be taught with data sets of other human&#39;s work, or else they have nothing to work off of or degrade by being fed other AI input. The first step for high quality and ethical AI tools is the informed consent of source material producers that their intellectual property and artistic labor is being used for AI training purposes. Without this consent these tools must die and be abandoned. The second is the operative intent of the AI tool. Is it being used as one component of a piece or is it the whole? A standard for human input of labor beyond the original prompt must be established in order to maintain quality of works and of artistic expressions. Third is informing the consumer. If a piece being produced to be consumed, the audience must be aware of the use of AI tools in its production. Without these criteria being met, the use of generative AI authors must not be allowed to be made equal to actual human authors
