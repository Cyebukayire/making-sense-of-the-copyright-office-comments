Software that uses machine learning to generate images only does so via whichever images are fed into its set of data. &ldquo;AI art&rdquo; thus involves taking artworks from artists&mdash;almost always without their consent or even without their knowledge&mdash;to generate an approximation of the collected, stolen artworks.  &ldquo;AI art&rdquo; does not create art at all, but rather plagiarizes artists by stealing their artwork and imitating it. Using machine learning software to steal art is a violation of ethics.
