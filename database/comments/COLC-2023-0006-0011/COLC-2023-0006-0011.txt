Either the AI is responsible for the work, in which case it has no human author and cannot be copyrighted, or the party responsible for the construction of the AI is responsible for the work and the copyright devolves to them.<br/>The operator of an AI, in order to copyright its product, must surely sufficiently transform it. To find otherwise would be declare that the operator of any other machine receives rights over its product inherent in his role. A position that would come as some rude surprise to factory owners.
