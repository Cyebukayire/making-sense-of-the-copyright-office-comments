1. I don&#39;t see any benefit in outright replacing humans with generative AI. AI can only output an amalgamation of what it&#39;s copied, a human can create something new. Furthermore, code produced by an AI is known to be unreliable.<br/>5. Yes. AI training datasets should be open to the public, and it should be strictly prohibited to use copyrighted material without explicit permission from the copyright holder. Terms of Service and Terms of Use should be barred from mandating permission to use submitted material in training datasets.<br/>6. As far as I know, whatever can be found on the Internet, using automated software, with little to no curation.<br/>6.2 As far as I know, almost never, which the only exceptions I know of being Getty Images and the Associated Press.<br/>8. Maybe noncommercial research. But generative AIs are generally being used to profit off other people&#39;s work without authorization or compensation.<br/>8.2 If they don&#39;t have permission from the copyright holder, they&#39;re pirates.<br/>8.3 It no longer becomes fair use once profit is involved.<br/>9. Opt in. Opt out is unacceptable.<br/>9.1 All uses.<br/>9.2 This is why opt in should be used. Opt out requires more effort to facilitate and doesn&#39;t resolve past infringement of copyrighted work.<br/>9.4 Copyright infringement lawsuit.<br/>9.5 Yes, but this should be settled by the author and the one hiring them.<br/>10 They should be contacted by the AI&#39;s creator.<br/>10.1 Of course, should both parties be willing.<br/>11 The biggest issue would be most people don&#39;t want their work to be used for training AI.<br/>13 AI companies that used copyrighted material to train their AIs would have to start from scratch, but that&#39;s their fault for training their AIs irresponsibly in the first place.<br/>15 Absolutely.<br/>15.1 Everything they used.<br/>15.2 A publicly accessible Website that can be searched.<br/>16 Ideally it should be mandatory to contact the copyright owner prior to use in training AI, but notification should be mandatory either way.<br/>18&ndash;21 No.<br/>22 Yes, if copyrighted material was used in the training dataset.<br/>24 Makers of AI should be legally required to make their training datasets accessible by the public. Existing laws do not suffice.<br/>25 Developers of the model.<br/>26 The AI violates it.<br/>28 Yes. Whenever it is shared.<br/>28.1 The AI developer and the end user.<br/>28.3 Fines.<br/>30 I&#39;m not sure, potentially laws against impersonation and defamation.<br/>31 Yes, a floor should be set, with states able to enact stricter standards.<br/>32 There should be, but I&#39;m not sure how such a law should be implemented.<br/>34 Using AI to imitate someone&#39;s voice and/or likeness is extremely perverted, especially without permission.<br/>
