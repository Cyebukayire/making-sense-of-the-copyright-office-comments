Ai is trained on writing and art that is created by and owned by individual artists. It infringes on the rights of the artist by taking their content without consent. It infringes on copyright law by taking their property without consent. Ai should not be allowed to be trained on social media platforms, where most artists and writers have no choice but to use these platforms in order to promote their work. Artists and writers who want to participate should have to opt in specifically, and those who do not want their copyright violated should be able to opt out. Ai should not be forced on creators in order to become a member of an online social media platform. Ai technology should only be trained on the art and writing of people who have given specific, explicit consent to it on it&#39;s own.
