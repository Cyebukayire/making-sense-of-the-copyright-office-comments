This should not be allowed. You will kill MASSIVE sectors in entertainment, media, publishing as well as ancillary businesses. The government is not ready for the amount of unemployment if this is allowed. they say 187 million jobs will be created because of AI but 185 million people will be unemployed because of it - thats ONLY if people are trained properly which eliminates a lot of the workforce over the age of 30. IBM is already firing people who hit 40. This will be a massive blow to Milennials/Gen Xers who still need to work for years to qualify for retirement. YOU MUST REGULATE TECH COMPANIES BETTER and AI should not be self regulated. Hire AI ethicists and experts (Sinead Bovell is one off the top of my head) you have no idea how many people who will put out of work if this is allowed.
