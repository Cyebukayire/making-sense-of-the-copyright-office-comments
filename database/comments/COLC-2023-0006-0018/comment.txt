The problem with AI art is that these programs don&#39;t just make art on their own. They are trained on other images, and nearly all of the currently available AI art programs use general internet searches to train their AI. Meaning, copyrighted images are used in the training of this AI.<br/><br/>I personally feel that AI art should not be copyrightable at all, simply because the way to produce AI art is to violate other copyrights. You can&#39;t copyright theft.
