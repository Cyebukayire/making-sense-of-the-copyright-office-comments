&quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; as we currently know it is not at all intelligent, and can only function via vast amounts of plagiarism and outright theft. Nothing &#39;created&#39; by these tools is actually made by them. It is merely pieced together from work stolen from thousands and thousands of actual artists and creators. It should be given the same copyright protections as any human plagiarist.
