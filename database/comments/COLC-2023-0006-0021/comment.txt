I am a tv writer currently on a 121 day (and counting) strike against our employers for  many concern&eacute;s including their inability to offer us protection from AI taking our jobs, or making them worse. AI has no place in creative work, AI should not be possible to copyright because it is inherently stolen from other artists work. Companies should not be allowed to use AI as an excuse to downsize or offshore American jobs.
