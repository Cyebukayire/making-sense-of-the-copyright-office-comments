I do not believe AI generated materials should be eligible for copyright. As has already been determined in the court system, copyright is to protect human generated works, and there are several ways in which AI can abuse and manipulate this system. Additionally, most, if not all, currently available AI generation programs are trained on media that the original copyright holders did not give permission to train on. This results in the AI producing content that frequently contains elements of other copyrighted materials, and often times is not a properly transformative work.
