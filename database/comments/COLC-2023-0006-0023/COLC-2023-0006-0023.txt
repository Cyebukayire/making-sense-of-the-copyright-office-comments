Quite simply, ML companies are garnering huge investment, conducting business and building software and services using assets they have not and are not interested in obtaining rights for. <br/><br/>An attempt was made to change the laws in the United Kingdom to give machine learning businesses exceptions to Copyright but these were halted.<br/><br/>there is no reason why these companies should not be building or obtaining license for the assets they need to build their software and services, garner their investment - like any other business.<br/><br/>they&#39;ve attempted to use the idea of &quot;AI&quot; to sidestep responsibilities and respect for the law and our industries.<br/><br/>Example: Midjourney provide a service that uses the marketplace assets and professional portfolios of users of Artstation, an American-owned platform for professionals in the computer graphics industries. <br/><br/>Their portfolios were taken to train these systems without having obtained permission and their information is used to selectively draw upon that model&#39;s compressed information to produce outputs that compete with artists. See: Greg Rutowski.<br/><br/>If allowed to proceed, owners would no longer be able to set the terms on their property, to decide if it is even used at all, and by whom, etc.<br/><br/>David Holz, of Midjourney said that it was not possible to get a hundred million images and know where they&#39;re coming from.<br/><br/>stock companies already exist for bulk. I put this to him on Twitter and was immediately blocked on the platform, stopping me from seeing further infringement and discussing it with users.<br/><br/>This blocking is common among this group of CEOs, who have colluded on Discord to erode these rights.
