Artificial Intelligence in its current state is a massive waste of computing resources and energy since it provides insufficiently accurate results to justify the expenditure. It should be shut down for any non-critical applications, which I define as any uses outside of unmarketable research into a more efficient version of artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>Any attempt to use artificial intelligence to replace the paintings or other works of artists or to otherwise make artists&#39; work unprofitable should be made illegal, until such time as the artists themselves collectively ask to license use of AI.<br/><br/>-Lilith Every
