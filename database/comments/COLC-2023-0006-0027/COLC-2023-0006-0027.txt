Training generative AI models on copyrighted materials (text, images, audio, etc.) should not be considered copyright infringement. It is akin to a human learning from these materials, which is not considered infringement.  Further, restricting AI training would not serve copyright&#39;s purpose of promoting the progress of science and useful arts.  Japan has taken the right approach on this topic by declaring that training AI does not violate copyright.<br/><br/>Output of generative AI should generally not be copyrightable, as the the IP value of the input prompt is generally minimal. There may be exceptional cases where an input prompt contains substantial IP value and has taken substantial effort to produce. In these cases, the burden should be on the producer to justify the copyright. <br/>
