AI is only a useful tool when it is ethically trained. It is currently allowed to steal and plagiarise freely and is putting people out of a job. There is no world where AI is an acceptable replacement for artists and their work. If an artist finds their work has been used to train an algorithm without their consent, that artist should be entitled to compensation and the owner/operator of the AI should be punished. There has to be transparency. Train and AI on your own work or admit you&#39;re just stealing from others to cut costs and cut corners at the expense of the hard workers<br/>
