As a writer, currently on strike in part due to the issues around AI, I strongly object to ny effort to copyright AI in any form.  AI IS THEFT. Pure and simple.  It is scraping data it has no legal right to use.  The entire technology is dangerous not only to copyright holders but to all of us.  I urge the government to step in now before it&rsquo;s too late.
