Generative AI should be heavily regulated and not allowed Copyright to produced materials. AI do not learn, the directly recreate patterns, and with a specific topic or small database, can very closely recreate other&#39;s intellectual property or copyrighted property. AI also has large potential for economic harm and loss of millions of jobs in all digital fields and needs regulations like that to ensure the stability of millions of people. Generative AI being able to be copyrighted is akin to a customer asking a chef to cook for them and claiming the dish the chef created as theirs, it is unjustified, harmful, and unnecessary.
