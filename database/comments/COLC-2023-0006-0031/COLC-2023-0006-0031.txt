AI-Generated content of any kind should not be copyrighted. Not only is it not generated by a Human and thus completely uncopyrightable by default (Naruto v. David Slater et al.), AI generation by default scans copyrighted work and work by people who do not consent for their work to be used by AI for use in its own generations, and is therefore plagiarism on a grand, easily-accessible scale. No matter what, I cannot in good conscience suggest that AI-generated work should be copyrightable. I suggest that AI-generated work should be barred from ever holding copyright, no matter what.
