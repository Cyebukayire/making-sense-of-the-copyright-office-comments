AI art is theft of legitimate labor. Plain and simple. There is no large language or image model which exists that canc reate images free of a real artist&#39;s work. They exist only to steal and destroy the jobs of legitimate artists. There should be NO legal commercial use of AI models at any level or in any capacity. <br/><br/>AI generative models are just plagiarism the long way round.
