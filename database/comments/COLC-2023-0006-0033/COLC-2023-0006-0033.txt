Let me preface by saying that I am a computer scientist. I have used image generators, I know how they work on a technical level, and I have worked with them in unofficial capacity.<br/><br/>I believe people have a fundamental misunderstanding of AI. A small subset of people obsessed with the concept of AI media have poisoned the well of discourse by convincing people that AI-generated imagery is at or above that of human creativity. That by merely entering a text prompt, one is able to create beautiful works of art that rival<br/><br/>This is not true. Please direct your attention to the following image gallery: https://imgur.com/a/Sr142en<br/>These are a small sample of images I generated myself using an open-source program called Disco Diffusion, an image generator that utilizes Google&#39;s Colab servers to output images from text prompts. As you might note, these images are...ugly, frankly. None of them suited the purposes I had in mind when I generated them, most are downright incomprehensible, and they barely even match the prompts I used. Had I simply commissioned an actual artist to draw a beach at sunset (image #2) or a grassy hill (image #3), I would have received much higher quality images more easily.<br/><br/>This is what I mean by a misunderstanding; when people talk about AI in the media, they only show the &quot;good&quot; images. The tiny fraction of the output that somewhat matches the input. In any rational society, the debate about AI should have ended merely by showing people all the bad results, AI would have faded into obscurity, gone the way of slap bracelets and the pet rock, and we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation.<br/><br/>I do not think AI will replace real artists any time soon. However, I believe that the aforementioned small subset of people who have oversold AI&#39;s abilities will cause lasting damage to artistic integrity, and failure to regulate AI will result in longer-lasting damage.<br/><br/>With that in mind, here are the responses to the questions I believe I can answer in full confidence:<br/><br/>18. I do not believe there are any circumstances in which a human providing a prompt to an image generator can be considered&mdash;legally or in general&mdash;the &quot;author&quot; of a work. Telling someone or something to make art does not equate to creating art in of itself. As is precedent, a client who commissions art from an actual artist does not necessarily own the art either.<br/>21. I do not believe the copyright clause affords any protections to AI-generated work. The copyright clause explicitly mentions authors and inventors and, as noted above, I do not believe a mere text prompt warrants authorship.<br/>22. The right to derivative work holds precedent, however the office should note that derivative work is held to a different standard than outright copyrighted work. You cannot place a hat on Mickey Mouse, declare the work &quot;derivative&quot;, and claim ownership. Should AI be regarded as derivative work, it should be held to the same standards as existing derivative work.<br/>23. Substantial similarity is more than enough to investigate claims of infringement, if only to prevent the obvious loophole of someone running a copyrighted work through an AI that barely changes anything in an effort to declare the work &quot;derivative&quot;.<br/>24. Failure to make training data or legal documentation proving ownership of training data is a failure of the developer of the AI model, not a failure of the copyright owner. If they cannot provide documentation, it suggests obfuscation from the fact that they likely did not obtain or use the data legally.<br/>25. The owner of the service should be held liable for infringement, as they are the ones using the model to provide commercial services. The end-user in particular should not be held liable, as they were not aware of and have no control over the use of copyrighted material.<br/>25.1. The only unique aspect of an open source program is determining who provided the training data. The open source material is the code, the training data is what&#39;s infringing on copyright.<br/>28. AI-generated work should be labeled as such, if only by convention, much like an &quot;all persons fictitious&quot; disclaimer in a book, or a label indicating a photo has been edited in a news article. The propensity for people to lie by creating fake images is already well-documented with the rise of photoshop, any regulation of AI should nip this potential pitfall in the bud.<br/>30. As is precedent, a person owns their likeness, including vocal (e.g. as with voice actors). If a person does not provide explicit consent to their likeness being used in a commercial context, it is a violation of their right of publicity. The use of an AI to chop up soundbites or images of the person as opposed to a human being chopping up soundbites or images of the person is irrelevant.<br/><br/>I hope you consider my opinions in this inquiry. As a computer scientist, I feel my opinion is at risk of being subsumed under a &quot;pro-AI&quot; stance.<br/><br/>I emphatically reject this generalization.<br/><br/>AI must be regulated.
