If AI is allowed unchecked, artists, voice actors and writers will eventually be out of jobs mostly due to companies trying to cut corners. This would be a dystopian level creativity destruction, where no actual content is being made by humans and the drive to be creative professionally is less and less incentivized. Please do not let this happen. These AI are inherently based on stealing content and learning from people who generally did not consent to their content being used for the algorithm.
