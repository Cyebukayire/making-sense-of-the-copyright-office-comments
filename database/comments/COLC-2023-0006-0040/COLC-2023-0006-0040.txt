AI in its current form for use in generation of images, music, voice, and videos/animation is in bad faith scraping/stealing from the works of artisans and actors and not a genuine product of transformative work.  Artist spend years gathering experiences, skills and practice to hone their crafts and create unique works as a result of their life experiences.  AI is fed the end result of that work Wholesale with no accreditation, compensation or investment outside the coding used to create the algorithms. Thr coding of the AI, self standing and without the input of finished works made by flesh and blood artists would be incapable in its current iteration to produce any viable end product.  AI should never be used as an &ldquo;End of the line&rdquo; generative process but instead as a mid-process tool to assist in initial iteration of ideas but ultimately being completely transformed leaving the final work to be 100% of the user/artist.
