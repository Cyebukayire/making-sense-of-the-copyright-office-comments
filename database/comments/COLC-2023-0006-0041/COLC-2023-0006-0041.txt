Artificial Intelligence could have been used to help creatives and guide us to the future. Instead, it is being used to hurt creatives by stealing their previous work to create &quot;new&quot; work. It&#39;s wrong and against the copyright law. I have always been told by teachers of the arts, &quot;If you write it, draw it, type it, or whatever, it&#39;s considered yours under copyright,&quot; but with AI being used to grab other people&#39;s work and likeness to create, that statement becomes false. AI should not be able to steal from others in order to create things. It should be used to enhance and help creatives with their work, either by giving them an extra idea to think about or putting a different color on their work if the artist doesn&#39;t like their original color palette. Hollywood studios are trying to pull a stunt and have scriptwriters edit AI &quot;written&quot; scripts to end the WGA strike AND to make it deemed &quot;copyrightable&quot;. They&#39;re also trying to use an actors likeness so they can make more films without needing the actor there (see Black Mirror episode, Joan is Awful, for reference) and not pay them. That&#39;s not fair to the writers and actors, and that&#39;s definitely not fair to those that use the copyright laws correctly. The government needs to put its foot down and create laws restricting AI from being used to create pieces of work that: A) steal from other pieces of work; and B) use the likeness of a person (their face, body, voice, etc.) without their permission or without proper compensation. The government also needs to make a law stating that editing an AI piece is not subjected to copyright because it was not created by a human in the first place. I&#39;d even say change the law altogether to say that something can be copyrighted if a HUMAN created it. That can include scripts, art, film, tv shows, music, even other humans since that&#39;s how reproduction is. Creating laws to regulate the use of AI can help us as humans remain creative and able to think outside of the box, while also keeping the rights of our ideas and bodies to ourselves.
