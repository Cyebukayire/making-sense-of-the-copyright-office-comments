I agree with past decisions and judgements that AI generated work should not be eligible for copyright protection. However, there should be protections for a person&rsquo;s likeness and voice. I have seen news of movie studios wanting to use AI reconstructions of background actors for minimal compensation, and this is by no means acceptable. Each background actor should have protections in this matter.<br/><br/>As an artist myself, I have been hesitant to share my work freely on the internet due to AI training algorithms scraping people&rsquo;s work. I have also discouraged another artist from doing the same, and I regret having to do so. I fear the advent of AI will displace me as an artist, rendering my services as an artist irrelevant and useless; or worse, people will see my work and instantly credit AI.
