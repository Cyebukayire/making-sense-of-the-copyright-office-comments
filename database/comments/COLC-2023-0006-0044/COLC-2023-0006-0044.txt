As a writer, generative AI presents an existential threat to my work, as it could be trained upon my copyrighted material and spit out something vaguely similar in style to my own, human-authored works that others may mistake the AI&rsquo;s material for mine, and therefore ascribe views that the AI expresses through its works to me. This is a threat to my way of living, as it could well harm my livelihood should the AI express an abhorrent viewpoint that could be mistaken as one that I myself hold. I would like for AI material to be considered non-copyrightable, and should it use copyrighted works in its dataset, the companies that made the AI should pay the copyright owners for such a use.
