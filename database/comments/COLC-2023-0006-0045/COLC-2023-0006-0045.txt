Hello,<br/><br/>Thanks for accepting comments.  I&#39;m not a copyright expert, but I am both an artist and a user of generative AI models.  I have a few thoughts for your consideration:<br/><br/>1) I think that using copyrighted materials for training machine learning systems should fall under fair use, under most situations.  I think this protection should not apply if the training is &quot;overfit&quot; to any of its inputs, and is able to reproduce them very accurately.<br/><br/>2) I think that the outputs of a generative AI system should be copyrightable if a significant human creative effort went into their production.  For example, if you generated an image from stable diffusion, and used inpainting to recreate a portion of it, I think that is a creative act.  Similarly, if you put significant work into the prompt engineering for a certain work, I think that ought to be copyrightable.  However, I think that effort needs to be invested into a single resulting work.  Even if the prompt engineering effort was significant, you shouldn&#39;t be able to claim all possible outputs.<br/><br/>I feel like this approach is largely consistent with the historical and present interpretations of copyright.  I mostly am commenting because I hear a lot of anti-ai propaganda, and I want you to hear the other side of that.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time!
