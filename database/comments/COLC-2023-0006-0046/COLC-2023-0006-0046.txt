I am a published author and university professor. The free use of copyrighted material for training AI is inappropriate. Tech companies are using works that the rest of us must pay to read and must cite. The lack of acknowledgment of the creative work of others is just theft. Entrepreneurs could partner with creators and should then share in the profits of subsequent products. If copyright of creative work is not protected here, then it will cease to exist. I am not opposed to the development of AI, just the exploitation that tech companies feel entitled to.
