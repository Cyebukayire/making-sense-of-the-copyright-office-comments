The introduction of AI into the field of creative works has created a void of chaos, where the distinguishing traits of authenticity have become unclear. Therefore, it is more important now than ever to ensure that the creative protection of human works is preserved, lest the exploitation of artists and creatives spirals even further.<br/><br/>1) AI works must only be trained on artists that have agreed to opt in to have their works trained. AI models should only be trained on works that have agreeably been opted in, or are not under copyright protection. AI works must be opt-in first; opt-out-only systems should not be allowed.<br/><br/>2) artists who have had their works trained upon must be properly compensated for their efforts, with a contractual agreement accepted by both the artist and the party using their works to train AI.<br/><br/>3) AI works should be properly labeled and/or described as being AI-assisted works. The barrier between what is AI-derived and what is authentic is continuously becoming harder to discern, and this leaves open the possibility of AI creators selling AI-derived work whilst posturing it as genuine art. This is tantamount to fraudulence, and should be punished accordingly.
