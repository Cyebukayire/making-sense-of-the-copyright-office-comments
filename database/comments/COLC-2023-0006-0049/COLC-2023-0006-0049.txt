I only know about how AI has impacted artists, so I&#39;ll limit my comment to that topic specifically. I have many friends who create art and it&#39;s been terrible to watch either parts of their work or whole pieces get used without their concent and without any financial reimbursement for AI to copy. I believe this is outright theft and that laws need to be put in place to protect artists and their creations. Artists had a difficult enough time with people stealing and copying their work before this AI was developed, and now that it&#39;s out and open for more and more people to use, the problem with copyright infringement has exploded.<br/><br/>Please consider how this technology is being used to harm people, and please help protect people. AI can be used to do amazing things, but we must make sure it&#39;s used for the benefit of all, and certainly not to bring harm or destruction to anyone.
