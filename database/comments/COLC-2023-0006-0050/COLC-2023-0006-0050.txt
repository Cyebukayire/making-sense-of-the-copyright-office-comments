All AI training needs to be opt-in only and all existing AI datasets that are not as such need to be wiped and only considered after being rebuilt with data collected only from consenting creators. The creators being asked for consent should be fully informed of how the AI will be used, how they will be credited, paid, etc and have full rights revoke their consent for any reason at any given time and this should apply to all types of AI. AI can be good if used correctly and should not be allowed to take power away from human artists because AI cannot truly create, it can only manipluate and combine what has already been created by humans.
