Artificial intelligence is only artificial. It&#39;s not intelligent. Using A.I. to curate internet searches will only promote confirmation bias and perpetuate disinformation. Use of A.I. in the arts violates any number laws that protect intellectual property. A.I. in law inforcement is the stuff of dystopian fiction. It doesn&#39;t matter how enthusiastically these tech bros try to promote the &quot;benefits&quot; of A.I. There are too many dangers to make it viable. At least for the foreseeable future. And this is coming from a Star Trek fan. We aren&#39;t there yet. Society isn&#39;t ready.
