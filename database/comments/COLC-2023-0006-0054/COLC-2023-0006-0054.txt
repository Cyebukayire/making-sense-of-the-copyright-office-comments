I work as a writer and, in my opinion, I think anything produced by AI should not be copyright protected at all. The reason copy right exists is to protect people&rsquo;s ideas and the products or works that they create, but the common theme in all of these works is that they all have intent. The person making them has an idea that they put to page/computer/etc. AI cannot think, it cannot have intent, therefore it cannot truly &ldquo;make&rdquo; anything. Any and all products of AI are just a glorified autocomplete made and tested by other people&rsquo;s works. On that note, how AI is trained should also be looked into and made public information, as since nobody knows how these AI programs are trained, it is very likely (id even hazard to say that they are definitely) trained off of works that they never got permission to use. If that doesn&rsquo;t violate current copyright laws, it should, as it uses someone else&rsquo;s ideas and works to train and make their own program without any permission, consent, or say from the original author, artist, or otherwise. Overall, I think AI in general needs to be cracked down on hard when it comes to both copyright for AI generated works, as well as using people&rsquo;s work to train the AI
