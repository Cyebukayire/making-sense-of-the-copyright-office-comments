AI generated images and text should not be allowed to be copyrighted. These generative programs are built on the backs of writers and artists without permission, consent, knowledge, or compensation. AI generation programs typically run on an &quot;opt out&quot; rather than an &quot;opt in&quot; model, which means most creators aren&#39;t even aware that their work is being used. On top of that, there have been multiple examples of AI generative tools using the work of dead artists, or artists without permission, and they refuse to delete datasets after the artist has asked for them to. <br/><br/>Beyond this, AI generative tools are taking away jobs. While I fully believe human art will always surpass AI generation, companies don&#39;t care because they think humans won&#39;t notice the difference. AI takes jobs away from people already struggling to make a living. It will devalue jobs and make it so people are paid less if they are asked to repair AI generated content. This has already been seen with translators&#39; jobs being devalued as they&#39;re expected to fix badly AI generated translations. <br/><br/>Don&#39;t give in to the demands of companies. Value human art and human creation. Only human created content should be allowed to copyright their creations. Human hands and minds are necessary for creation. Even AI generation relies SOLELY on human creation to even be a thing.
