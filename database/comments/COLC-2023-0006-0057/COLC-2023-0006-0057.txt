I don&#39;t believe AI can be copyrighted because AI only functions with stolen imagery. If I tell an AI service to generate a fantasy elf, that software&#39;s idea of a fantasy elf is composed entirely of stolen pictures of elves that other people drew. Those individual artists whose data has been scraped without their consent own the image of the elf, not the AI parent company, and certainly not me. I did not create anything. The AI did not create anything. AI is basically piracy software for art, and nobody should be allowed to copyright a pirated product as their own anymore than I can sample someone else&#39;s song and call it mine, or pirate a movie and claim it&#39;s mine now.
