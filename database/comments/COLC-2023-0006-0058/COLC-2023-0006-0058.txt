I, Tiffany Freund, and submitting this on behalf of myself and my husband, Robert Freund. We believe that there need to be regulations in regards to artificial intelligence. We are both authors, and have always registered our books through the copyright office. We also commission art works and obtain commercial license&#39;s and copyright for this work. But the threat to our work and our livelihood is on the line due to A.I. Our books are being into machines to be used as training without our permission, using our copyrighted work. Art is being fed into these machines to train A.I. for people to alter work that does not belong to them to be used for free. Art should be human made. Anything made by a machine, especially when it&#39;s being trained on work already created by a human without permission, should never be copyrightable. It&#39;s unethical. Not to mention the amount of jobs that are being eliminated because of this. So we are asking you to please not allow for A.I. to be copyrightable, and to add restrictions and regulations. Anyone using A.I. should gain the permission of the original artist, and that artist should be given recognition as compensation.
