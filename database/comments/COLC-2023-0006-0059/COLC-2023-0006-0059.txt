As a writer and editor, I&rsquo;ve already begun to see impacts on my field. I was alarmed and outraged to hear that major AI systems have scraped writing for the purpose of training their AI, without compensation or consent, from certain sites on the internet where I share my work. Although I never gave permission for my work to be used in this manner, these companies are now able to profit from stolen work that myself and countless others have created, using their new plagiarism engines to put the people who unknowingly trained their system out of jobs.<br/><br/>In addition to the impact AI will have on creative industries, it will be disastrous for the work of researchers and journalists, leaving the general public with poorer quality misinformation in place of human-produced content. We&rsquo;ve already seen examples of AI supplying incorrect facts for journalistic articles, a lawyer presenting fake AI-generated cases, and how-to books on foraging that supply incorrect and dangerous information about poisonous plants.  <br/><br/>New legislation to address the detrimental effect of AI is needed urgently, before more damage can be done. AI-generated content, whether visual art, writing, or otherwise, should never be copyrightable. Additionally, generative AI models such as ChatGPT, which trained their system on stolen content without consent from or compensation for the creators, should be heavily penalized for using a system built on stolen work. Finally, news organizations or political campaigns that use AI-generated photos to mislead their reading or viewing public should be heavily fined. AI-generated news sites, research papers, and full texts without any human input should be banned entirely.<br/><br/>This is a hugely important issue for hundreds of thousands of people across the country whose livelihoods stand to be destroyed, for hundreds of thousands more who have been stolen from, and for millions who will be subject to the misinformation spread by AI in critical areas such as medicine, journalism, law, and other vital, fact-based areas where having the correct information can mean a life-or-death situation.<br/><br/>Please heavily restrict this technology before its negative impact can spread further.<br/><br/>https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-generative-artificial-intelligence-regulation/<br/>https://www.npr.org/2023/04/27/1172387911/how-can-people-spot-fake-images-created-by-artificial-intelligence<br/>https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/05/02/rapid-growth-of-news-sites-using-ai-tools-like-chatgpt-is-driving-the-spread-of-misinforma<br/>https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/lawyer-who-cited-cases-concocted-by-ai-asks-judge-spare-sanctions-2023-06-08/<br/>https://decrypt.co/154187/ai-generated-books-on-amazon-could-give-deadly-advice
