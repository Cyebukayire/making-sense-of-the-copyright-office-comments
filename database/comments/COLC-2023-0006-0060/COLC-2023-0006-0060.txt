As an author of science fiction, I spend a good deal of time speculating on the future of AI. Having my work scraped to be remixed and reprocessed by a LLM was never on my mind until the past few months. <br/><br/>Copyright protection should ensure that no one can take my work and use it without my permission to make other works. LLMs should not be allowed to do what a human isn&#39;t permitted to do. Music is protected down to a recognizable series of notes from being remixed; why isn&#39;t my writing equally protected?<br/><br/>Likewise, what&#39;s been made by a LLM should not be entitled to the rights and protections offered by copyright law. All a LLM does is remix what others have written. There is no true creative synthesis behind it, and a LLM is not a person, under law. A person *using* an LLM to scrape other people&#39;s work and regurgitate it into a work is not creating anything new, either, and should not be afforded the protection of copyright--rather, they should be prosecuted for infringing on the copyrights of others.
