Every generation thinks the younger generation is going to destroy it. Except this time, we&#39;re right. Generative AI has (or will shortly have) the ability to create books, poems, scripts, paintings etc. and in doing so, will erase humans from the creation of art. Generative AI should not be afforded the protection of a Copyright. The intent of a copyright is to encourage creation. If a writer knows their work will be fed into some machine then spit back out in an altered form and they are neither consulted nor compensated -- who will continue creating? Why create when your creation can be stolen, tweaked, then sold? While many create for the joy of it, our world demands practicality. We also have to pay for coffee and TVs and cell phone charging cords. Should every artist have a &quot;day job&quot; and create on the side? What kind of work do you think that will produce? When someone is underpaid and overworked the last thing they want to do is more work. Which is what creating (even when we love it) is. It&#39;s work. And farming that out to a computer so that a corporation can profit? That truly will be the end of our creative society.
