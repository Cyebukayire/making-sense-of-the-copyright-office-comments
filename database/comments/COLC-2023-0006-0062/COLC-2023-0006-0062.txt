I work in the Information Technology field and have integrated AI into both work and hobby creative craft.<br/><br/>I&#39;m of the strong opinion that AI generated media should not be considered a copyrightable work for reasons both practical and philosophical.<br/><br/>Setting aside the impossibility of assigning authorial intent and consistent artistry to a machine process, the imitability of AI generation both by humans and other AI tools makes works hard to consider original in the first place. Should the same settings and toggles be applied to a machine learning creation engine, it would not matter who initiates the system, or even whether a human is involved at all. The resulting generations would be subject to touchups and edits at best, at which point the work is instantly a derivative of a piece that is already created. The process for verifying how much or how little a work has been modified to be compliant with even the most lenient conditions invites room for massive error, or downright abuse of the system.<br/><br/>In the simplest terms, it&#39;s little different than giving a wild animal a camera. Even if the resulting content is novel, interesting, and marketable, it is still content that is absent of human input beyond creating the conditions for it to be made.
