AI is a travesty. If companies are allowed to copyright AI that&rsquo;s directly sources original content from musicians, voice actors, writers and artists, including their physical likenesses and voices, they will effectively destroy Art in America and across the world. All for MONEY. We clearly have a HUGE PROBLEM in this country surrounding millionaires and billionaires hoarding resources and eschewing responsibility for the harms they cause and subverting regulations intended to prevent them gaining monopolies, to the point that we as a country look foolish pretending we are anything other than a capitalist oligarchy&rsquo;s puppet. AT LEAST protect the artists and preserve ONE pillar of our society as we understand it.
