There&#39;s an old canard about the law of large numbers that says if you put a million monkeys to work at a million typewriters that they&#39;ll eventually bang out a few Shakespeare sonnets. I think about that often when it comes to artificial intelligence and art, that they&#39;ve just replaced the monkeys with bytes and now a comedic thought experiment can be done in a server cluster or in your pocket. It makes for fascinating tools and toys, and as an artist there are certainly a few machine tricks that have made my life easier.<br/><br/>But in many ways AI creations seem to be poised to make my life as an artist a lot harder. In this response I would like to focus on two - the alienation of the artist and the unprecedented potential for copyright trolling.<br/><br/>Alienation of artistic labor arises from two sources. The first is the tendency of AI to displace artists with products that are deemed &quot;good enough&quot; in places where artists have been able to find a niche in capitalism (commercial illustration, graphic design, stock photography). Doubtless there will be consumers that reject &quot;good enough&quot; for great, but the elimination of the bottom of the market is the elimination of fertile grounds for talent to grow. It means that the cost to enter the market will increase, putting it out of the reach of a diverse and talented pool of creators and into the hands of people that have the money to take risks and the connections to get opportunities. This will necessarily narrow the vision of the filed and do damage to the progress of art.<br/><br/>The second way AI will create artistic alienation will be by turning artists into managers. Artists will not be the ones creating and innovating, they will be iterating prompts from AIs and checking to see if a picture has the correct number of fingers. Their role will be a quality assurance overview of a machine&#39;s output. While management is fine, it&#39;s not why people become passionate about art and design. Making the role of the artist solely to tweak or critique again narrows what the field can be and discourages people from pursuing art.<br/><br/>Looming larger over this is my concern that AI will lead to an explosion of copyright trolling, where businesses are generating works not for the sake of art (or even commerce) but to lay traps for others. One potential example comes from the crypto-boom where a company proposed selling off the color spectrum, saying that the owners of certain colors would get paid every time their color was used. Thankfully this scheme failed on its face, but it&#39;s not hard to imagine a dedicated business flooding the copyright office with computing power so that they can stand in the way of any conceivable work like toll collectors demanding a fee to let you pass safely. Sure, you might have prevailed in court - but the cost to litigate the script for your student film or first novel would be far more than you&#39;d ever make off of it, so you pay the toll collectors and if you can&#39;t pay the toll collectors then you get a job at Foot Locker.<br/><br/>Not allowing AI-generated art to be copyrighted stymies both of those tendencies. It allows for a free and fair market for artists, and will better encourage people to pick up a pen, a camera, or a brush and participate in the arts.<br/><br/>Of course there are going to be gray areas and ambiguities, where what might have started as an AI prompt becomes somethign more after human hands like a sculptor bringing a statue out of a rock that was already vaguely shaped like a guy. Plumbing the depths of that intersection and finding the point where the spark of life should begin is a bit beyond me and seems like it could be handled with the same kind of judgment and discretion we see for things like sampling and fair use.
