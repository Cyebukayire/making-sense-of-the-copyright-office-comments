Unregulated AI worries me tremendously. I have been a professional writer for about 15 years. My industry has changed dramatically in just the past few months because of the proliferation of this technology with *zero* regulation to guide it. We desperately need regulations in place, especially in regard to copyright. The unabated scraping of creative works (writing, artwork, music, voice acting, etc.) is doing tremendous damage. And right now there is nothing someone like me can do to protect our work, our copyright or our livelihoods. I hope you&#39;ll consider strong regulations on this technology. Thank you.
