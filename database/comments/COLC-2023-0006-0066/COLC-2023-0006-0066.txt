10.1. There is clear and unambiguous precedent for copyright owners to provide training data under an affirmative consent model in a way which produces worthwhile output. An example I am personally aware of is a 2020 collaboration between the Dadabots team and music educator Adam Neely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xMhRwxXJTc<br/><br/>In this example, the makers of the AI system instructed Adam Neely to produce suitable training material, which he did, and then used that material to create a neural network that generates sounds endlessly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRwJzw4VvZA<br/><br/>It is clear from examples like these and the other collaborations mentioned by Dadabots that AI systems trained on voluntarily-collected training data can generate worthwhile material, and therefore that research can be done and the field of AI advanced without use of unlicensed material.<br/><br/>We accept the necessity of restrictions in other fields for the sake of ethics. Even in the middle of a pandemic, where the testing of a vaccine was of tremendous urgency, we did not simply expose people to COVID-19 and see which ones got sick. We did not have to - we could simply wait and observe how many accidental, unavoidable infections occurred and progressed to full illness. However much excitement there is about the possibilities represented by generative AI, if there are copyright concerns about the training data (and I believe many people have convincingly argued there are), it is unambiguous that there are ways to develop generative AI without such concerns.
