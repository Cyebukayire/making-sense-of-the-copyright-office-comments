As a writer and a photographer, I am certainly concerned with my IP being used in AI models without my consent. The issue that I am most concerned with is the sneaky &quot;opt-out&quot; policies that different corporations use without notifying artists or content providers directly of a change that allows any content to be used in AI models. For example, I sell my photographs through Adobe Stock. Adobe&#39;s policy on use of AI is not just extremely confusing, it is almost impossible to find. There is competing information as to whether or not my photos are automatically now included in Adobe&#39;s Generative AI features, whether it is yet to come, whether I will be notified via email/etc and allowed therefore to opt-in or opt-out, or if this will simply be rolled into the Terms of Service and therefore I must hunt to see if my IP is now being used in AI prompts. I do not feel that this is correct, and I&#39;m aware of other companies doing something similar. I believe that there should be laws and regulations made so that companies must 1) inform artists of their policies specifically via email, mail, or notifications on the site; 2) must receive specific OPT-IN from artists to use their content in generative AI models, not receive an opt-out; 3) have specific policies that are easy to read, easy to find, and easy to understand to know how my images are being used.<br/><br/>While I make money based on my images being sold, and therefore understand that any such site has certain rights to the images I am uploading, when I uploaded them, there was no AI. Adobe (along with any stock photography site) makes money from my images as well, and it is not correct for my images to make them more money without my compensation being increased, and in addition, it is not correct for them to be able to make money from images that I only provided under a specific type of agreement. <br/><br/>At it&#39;s core, &quot;opt-out&quot; policies in tech should be outlawed. It is in the best interest of us all to be conscious of what we are opting-into, versus having to find out later on we&#39;ve been enrolled in programs or policies that were not clearly and proactively communicated to us.
