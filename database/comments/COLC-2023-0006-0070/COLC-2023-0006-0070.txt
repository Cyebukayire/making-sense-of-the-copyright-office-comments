So as a voice actor (voice artist per se), I consider any works that I do as an artistic form, thus a creation, thus legally valid under the laws of International Copyright. I create, therefor unique and therefor enjoys copyright. That grant of copyright should supercede any legal agreements, whether stated directly or obfuscated. As I see it, any company that wishes to engage in using something that is as non-fungible as a human voice as part of their own offering is violating what I consider International Copyright law. I am not a lawyer and my belief can be disputed. However, AI or alternatively generated human voice that is a direct copy of a real human voice should be rendered illegal and/or invalid.
