I  think it&#39;s  acceptable as the courts have found that AI art cannot be copyrighted. However I don&#39;t believe using art to train AI art  should be considered copyright  infringement. If the art doesn&#39;t LOOK like it&#39;d be copyrighted infringement if made manually,  it shouldn&#39;t be considered copyright  because some art was involved in making it, anymore than somebody looking at references while doing a painting is considered inherently copyright infringement.
