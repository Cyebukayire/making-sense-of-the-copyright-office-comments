Generative algorithms (AI) cannot be creative by definition. Like any machine, they require input to function, as their only true ability is to recognize patterns. The capability of the system to recognize patterns to reproduce anything requires the input of an uncountable number of resources. The only way the developers of these systems can acquire access to these resources is by the forced access and theft of others&#39; assets all over the world. Through the use of manual copying, digital scraping, and others. This is clearly copyright infringing. The reproduction of someone&#39;s work can be easily attained by simply telling the system to recognize and target an individual specifically. Even without targeting. The &quot;AI&quot; will use a number of private assets to make patterns within a given work, all without being substantially transformative in its process and result.
