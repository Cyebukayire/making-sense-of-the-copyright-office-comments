AI is an infringement on intellectual properties including art in all forms it takes.  It is also not INTELLIGENT by any means - it has been proven to be subjected towards bias and falsifying any information.  It takes away any means of individual claims only to feed corporations that will twist it towards any of their bias towards making money with no care who or what it is destroying in the process.  It is a machine basically that is run on human programing that is geared towards the algorithm of matching results it gains from whatever source it&#39;s pulling from.  The falsifying frame work of what it does and how it uses human created arts, or even humans themselves living or dead, should not be considered anything other than a fake and in no way be considered legal on any level.
