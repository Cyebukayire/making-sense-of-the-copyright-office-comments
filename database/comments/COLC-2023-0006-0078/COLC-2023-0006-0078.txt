AI generated works are a massive threat to all creative industries. More and more visual artists I know are afraid to share their work as they don&#39;t want either accused of using an AI or to have their works fed to an AI to turn it new work. There is talk recently that fiction writers are having works fed into AI as well, to either &#39;finish&#39; from samples or allow for large companies to train new AI to potentially replace their writers. <br/><br/>If AI generated works become protected under copyright creative endeavors of the human mind, the very thing copyright is meant to protect and encourage artists to create, becomes meaningless. Some people argue this enables more people to create, but instead it steals possible income from artists of all walks of life and mediums while reducing the encouragement to learn to create for amateurs. <br/><br/>The very nature of copyright and what it means to us as creators is art risk. AI art is the method of attack. Do not destroy the years of dedicated work and practice I and millions upon a millions of others have given ourselves to.
