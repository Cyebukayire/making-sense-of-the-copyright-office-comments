I am completely against AI being copyrightable. These algorithms are not in any way intelligent, there is no original creation in anything that the algorithm gives you.  The actual term for these algorithms is &quot;Aggregate Engine&quot;. The only way for these engines to produce any sort of content is to feed it other artwork or literature. Additionally because of the way these work, all current &quot;AI&quot; work is being fueled with stolen artwork. Additionally these engines cannot reprocess what they create. If fed their own creation, the engine sees significant instability and loses all accuracy in the prompt given. There is not a single ethical way for the readily available options to create their own content. All artwork must either be taken randomly from the web, which will allow the engine to work by sheer volume of things to copy and mimic. Without a constant intake of new styles, artwork, text, and even voice; these engine crumble. There is not a means to fuel these in any ethical way. They consume far too much and do so by web scraping or manual feeding. Either of which gravely violates the original copyright of the artist&#39;s artwork and transforms it into a gross copy, melded with as many other similar images as possible. I urge the US copyright office to disavow &quot;A.I.&quot;, name the engines as what they actually are, and prevent millions of jobs from being taken from innocent Americans. This will kill the creative industry and make everything we consume soulless. The very point of art is to intrigue thought and show an individuals expression. Allowing this to happen will have grave and far reaching consequences that will require more than regulation to fix. This will also destroy business&#39; that allow artists to host their own artwork as merchandise. They will be flooded with meaningless exact duplicates.
