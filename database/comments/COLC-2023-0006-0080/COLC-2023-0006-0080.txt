I would like to start by saying, AI does not exist. <br/><br/>What has been created is a digital mirror test. People engage with an &quot;ai&quot; and it feeds them back responses in the exact tone mirroring the person.  Instead of just that persons reflection, they see a reflection of themselves combined with the reflection of mankind in general. <br/><br/>AI does not learn. It cannot learn. It cannot make decisions. It does not, cannot and will not ever know right from wrong. It only knows what its been programmed to know. <br/><br/>It excludes information based on what the developers tell it to exclude. It is bias in information based on what the developers views are - conservative, liberal, conspiracy drive, science driven, etc.<br/><br/>As such, what we call AI is truly nothing more than a search engine of knowledge combined with a mirror test. <br/><br/>To limit what it can store in its databases, would be the equivalent of telling Google search that it can not store cache copies of websites, store website titles, store descriptions nor index images.<br/><br/>Even when we talk about image based AI, just like when dealing with an AI chat bot, it does not &quot;steal&quot; anything. It reviews information it has and feeds it back to the user in ways never before spoken or, in the case of art, ways never before seen.<br/><br/>From an art perspective AI is just a new tool to create art. Just like traditional tools, one can use it to create forgery works but that&#39;s been done in the art world since long before AI. AI, unless specifically instructed to, does not produce copywritten works. <br/><br/>Because of these things, it would be as illogical to say we can&#39;t &quot;train AI&quot; on copywritten works as it would be to say &quot;people cannot study and learn&quot; from copywritten works. All AI is, is a search engine feeding us back information in completely new formats... very similar to a child researching a topic for a book report... and rewriting everything they learn in their own words.<br/><br/>I think my point has been made.
