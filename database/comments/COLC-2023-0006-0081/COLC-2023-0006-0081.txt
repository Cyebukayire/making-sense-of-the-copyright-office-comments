AI should NOT be able to take other people&#39;s work for their databases. AI is pulling people&#39;s work off the internet to generate its own &quot;art&quot; but it has no way to use and learn from the art, it&#39;s just steals it, warps it slightly, and then spits it back out. It should not have access to people&#39;s work!!
