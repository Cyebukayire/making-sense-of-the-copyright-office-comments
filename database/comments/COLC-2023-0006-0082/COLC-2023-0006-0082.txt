As of the current technology, AI is a misnomer. There is no &quot;intelligence&quot; in machine learning, it is just mixing together the inputs following a formula. The formula itself (i.e. the inner workings of the &quot;AI&quot;), created by a human, may be considered a work of art, but not what the formula produces. The product of the &quot;AI&quot; should not be copyrightable by the prompter any more than someone can take a public image off the internet and copyright it. The fact that multiple public works are involved in each result is not enough evidence of human creation; the work of creating a prompt is nowhere near comparable to the work of actually putting the inputs together (which is done by the formula, not the human). While some may argue that a human taking &quot;inspiration&quot; from existing art is the same, I completely disagree. When a human artist takes &quot;inspiration&quot; to create their own work, their life experiences and physical skill are also involved in the creative process, even for less physical skills like photography. The &quot;AI&quot; uses only the inputs (which have their own copyrights) and what is included in its formula (which would be copyrightable by the person who created the &quot;AI&quot;, and not anyone else who uses it). In short, &quot;AI&quot;-generated outputs should not be copyrightable and &quot;AI&quot; should not be allowed to use copyrighted works as inputs without express permission from the copyright holder. As such, it should be required for all AI tools to have a comprehensive and easily accessible list of all inputs and their copyrights and evidence of permission for every input.
