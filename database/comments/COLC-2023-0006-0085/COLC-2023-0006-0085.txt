As a writer, I understand reckoning with evolving technology is part of the job. However, the rapid, unethical and unchecked evolution of AI is a concern for creators, the public and even the world are large. The tech industry has long been given free reign in how they develop dangerous technology that changes the world, leaving the public to deal with the consequences after much harm has been done. It is not too late to put restrictions on AI.<br/><br/>The utter disregard these companies have for not only copyright, but for the health of the shared cultural outpour of humanity, will render the pursue of a professional path in the arts nearly extinct. <br/><br/>AI devalues human intellect, but more importantly, it devalues the human spirit, it devalues its creativity, its ingenuity and the very purpose of creation itself.<br/><br/>
