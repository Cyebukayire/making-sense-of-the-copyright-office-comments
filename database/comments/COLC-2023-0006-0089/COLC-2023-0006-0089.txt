While AI could be a useful tool, it should not be able to be used for a final product. The way it created it&rsquo;s output is through taking pieces of real humans&rsquo; hard work. Taking an existing copyrighted IP and using it for a different project should not be legal. Plus only humans can truly create. If a monkey can&rsquo;t own the IP on a photograph, an AI program can&rsquo;t either.
