I would love to start with mentioning  that in my opinion &#39;AI&#39; technology is not inherently evil, but what It is used for can be, legally gray, immoral or downright illegal down the line due to legal litigations.<br/><br/>As an Artist, the AI debacle has been Coopted from Tech Giants to create a massive Databases which have been scraped of the internet, training their models.<br/>All of that has been done without consent of the artists. The argument of &quot;opting out&quot; has been made to obstruct individuals from being removed from the dataset.<br/><br/>Those companies did this willfully, they knew and confirmed that decision was purposful , becasue  during polling, they had recieved about 90%+ Disagreement from creators if they would agree with their work being used to train the dataset.<br/><br/>If the technology was not used for commercial purposes, but instead research, that would have been superb experiment, however thats not what happened..<br/><br/>The Tech companies are now  implementing paying models from scrapped works from non-consenting artists, and image datasets which are poisioned with copyrighted work.<br/><br/>Should companies provide compensation to every artist that their dataset was used in training the model, in forms of residuals, then that would be optimal solution, of course - IF artists or creators CONSENTED for their data to be used in that attempt.<br/><br/>Although I do not currentlly reside within US, my business also includes US customers, AI  - in current form - is impacting that business and disrupting the industry by allowing unregulated use, exploiting both individual rights as well as corporate intellectual property.
