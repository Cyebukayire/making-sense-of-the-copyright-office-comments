AI cannot replace the human experience. It is grossly negligent that instead of developing AI to fix dangerous professions and dilemmas which could save human life, the professionals in the field have chosen to pursue avenues which strip humanity of our experience. Art should be left to humans, it is our shared experience and our humanity that creates art, that creates work that transcends centuries and culture because it is a reflection of the human experience. AI should be used to create programs and robotics that can save human lives. No more miners with injuries, or oil riggers with lost limbs. Use AI to make jobs safer for humans not to strip our souls. AI shouldn&rsquo;t be making poetry. It should be developed in service to human life. Aid humanity in a safer and cleaner future. Not one where our voices are silenced in exchange for a computer&rsquo;s rendering of literature.
