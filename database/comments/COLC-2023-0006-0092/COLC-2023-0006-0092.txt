Greetings.<br/><br/>I am a vocal artist (narrator and voice actor) and author who strongly opposed AI in the arts. My dream has always been to be able to sustain on what I love to do in life, which is create art. The human experience and new ideas are introduced through art, which has evolved throughout the ages. Be it through writing, visual art, vocal art, or anything else. <br/><br/>AI removes the human experience and any new ideas from art by using stolen copyrighted works from human artists. It is an excuse to not put the work in to learn the skill. It isn&#39;t a matter of &#39;advancing technology&#39; like going from newspaper to television. It is typing in a few words for a &#39;prompt&#39; gives a cobbled mishmash of creatives&#39; hard work they did not give permission to use. There is nothing new there. <br/><br/>We will never advance in the arts if we are stuck by AI, because creatives will stop creating. Why continue to create if our work is going to be stolen and fed to a machine, to be regurgitated as some &#39;techbro&#39; or corporation trying to make a quick buck? <br/><br/>As a vocal artist, people are opting to go with AI from stolen voices as opposed to real narration, which requires acting. Text-to-speech is a robotic voice and helps with accessibility, which I am not against - but training an AI through stolen narrators to properly act and try to capture the emotion of a book? That is horrible.<br/><br/>Video games lose their soul, and as a consumer, AI characters which includes voice acting and writing, or other assets, would completely ruin my experience. Again - there are no new ideas there, and even if there were, it would be stolen without permission.<br/><br/>Humans can learn from one another in writing or art. But if I copied an entire novel from several others and put it together, it would not be creating anything. If I traced other artists&#39; work and presented it as my own, it would not be creating anything. Humans learn and then present new ideas with what we&#39;ve learned. AI cannot do that. <br/><br/>Creatives will be impacted to a gigantic degree if this is not regulated. There will be a massive downtick in genuine human art in all areas. Writing, music, visual, voice acting, animation, every category. What we are left with is soulless and without progression. Giant corporations will replace artists with talent and genuine love for their craft to save money. Time and again, greed has won out in this country. This will be no different.<br/><br/>Unless universal basic income can be implemented, where creatives would be able to make genuine art alongside the AI and offer it to the public (without risk of it being stolen and fed to the machine), this would be the end of human-created art as we know it. It would be less of a problem if all of the data was not stolen from people who did not give permission, at least the &#39;ethical tool&#39; excuse could apply, because it would have been given with permission. That clearly is not the case.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s sad. We&#39;ve lost one of the most beautiful things about being human if we lose the arts.
