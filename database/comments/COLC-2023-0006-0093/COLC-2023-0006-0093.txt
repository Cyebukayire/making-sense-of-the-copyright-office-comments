Artificial intelligence should not be given copyright privileges. AI is trained with the work of real writers and artists, so any &ldquo;content&rdquo; AI generates would not be original and may even infringe on others&rsquo; content rights. AI can be helpful in many ways, but it should not work to replace writers, artists, and creators who spend time, money, and effort honing their crafts. Copyright for AI threatens jobs and human expression through art as a whole.
