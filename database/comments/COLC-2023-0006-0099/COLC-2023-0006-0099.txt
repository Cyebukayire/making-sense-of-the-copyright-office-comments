I am a television director and independent writer, and I am concerned about the implications of unregulated AI will have on copyrights and livelihoods. Currently, copyright holders have little to no recourse when their words are scraped--stolen--by unregulated AI datasets and machine learnings. Reasonable regulations would protect copyright holders without hindering innovation. As new technologies emerge, we must work to make sure we are using technology in the most responsible way possible. I&#39;m concerned that the increased use of unregulated AI technologies will have catastrophic ramifications to our creative fields, including but not limited to art, writing, and even music. In a world just a few short years after the start of a global pandemic, during which we retreated to the sanctuary of the arts, films, television, books, etc., we cannot allow for those careers, those creatives, to be sidelined while AI regurgitates the scraped--stolen--words and ideas, sans the human nuance. I don&#39;t want my words to speak for someone else - I want my words to speak for me.
