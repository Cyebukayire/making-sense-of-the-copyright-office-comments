As a librarian that has worked in both academic and public libraries for roughly a decade and who has worked with and spoken to many authors and readers during this time I want to state my extreme concerns regarding the intellectual theft that powers most, if not all, AI chat and art bots at this time. Beyond my base level concern with how AI operates, I feel we must be absolutely clear that in order to qualify for copyright several conditions must be met. These conditions include: one, that the work must be fixed in a tangible medium; two, that the work must be original; and three, that the work must have an author. The work being created by AI is NOT original, it is in fact the regurgitation of unattributed works that have been used without the creator&#39;s permission to fuel the AI. Yes, at times the AI may generate a new sentence but it is all based upon the unattributed works of others. Furthermore, the work does NOT have an author. In the case Naruto, a Crested Macaque, v. Slater (Apr. 23, 2018), the court held that non-human animals could not bring a case of copyright infringement to court. If an animal, a sentient animal capable of creating art, cannot hold copyright over it&#39;s own creations, why would any entity that is not alive or (currently) sentient, be able to? In my capacity as an information professional it is very clear that AI generated text, art, and other creations, fall outside the realm of copyright and should not be considered by any legal body to be able to hold any such claims.
