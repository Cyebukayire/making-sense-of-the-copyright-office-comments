Artistic works created (even partly) by Artificial Intelligence should never be afforded Copyright protection. The slope is just too slippery. This is a technology that even its creators can&#39;t quite explain, and yet is being heralded by certain tech/business people as some kind of cost-saving, time-saving tool. But it&#39;s not a &quot;tool&quot; at all - it&#39;s an existential threat to humanity in that many would flock to use it to replace the very creativity and inventiveness that has allowed the human race to thrive and evolve. And if humans are deprived of the opportunity to create (since none of us would stand a chance in terms of market economics against an unpaid machine), then a very major piece of what makes us humans will cease. A world where stories of hope, despair, longing, conquest, etc. are no longer shared (as they have been for thousands of years) by those who&#39;ve experienced life, but instead regurgitated through the filter of some algorithm, is a world that can no longer learn and evolve naturally. <br/>Just as importantly as the macro, existential issues, A.I. generated work should not be afforded copyright protection because it requires no real effort to create the work. Artists and creators achieve through some combination of talent and/or extremely hard work. And while I realize that &quot;hard work&quot; is likely not a legal threshold that can be considered, it is still a part of the recipe of what makes something truly &quot;original&quot;.  All of the mental permutations and life experiences that go into forming something that&#39;s truly unique can never be replicated by a machine, or by someone typing prompts into a machine. I, like millions of others, have no interest in listening to music created by a non-musician who merely knows how to take advantage of the latest technology. I&#39;ve worked in technology for over twenty years, and I&#39;ve had multiple troubling conversations where software engineers with no real investment in creativity or the arts have stated their intentions to (and this is an exact quote from one engineer): &quot;...just crank out a few books without having to write shit...&quot; What a pointless world it would be if this were to become a widespread mentality...which I believe it would if A.I. work were giving legal protections.<br/>I understand the argument that some use that &quot;there&#39;s no putting the genie back in the bottle&quot;, or even &quot;how would anyone know if I used A.I.?&quot; But those tragically defeatist arguments can both be struck down by never affording the A.I. work any kind of copyright protection. Studios and publishers aren&#39;t going to risk their businesses by producing works that can be legally copied/imitated and distributed. It would be an unsustainable model. And the argument that &quot;nobody would know&quot; is just another lazy way for certain people to excuse bad behavior. The ability to &quot;get away&quot; with something should never correlate to how much we tolerate it or allow it. <br/>I hope you will focus, above all else, on what a critical inflection point this is in the history of humanity. Allowing for any kind of copyright protection for A.I.-generated works will instantly erode the many incredible creations that are yet to come. Technology has come too far, too quickly, because it has been a focus for decades. But perhaps it&#39;s time to reverse or at least dramatically slow that trend. <br/>I hope you will help ensure humanity&#39;s continued survival, because that&#39;s literally what&#39;s at stake.<br/>Thanks so much for taking the time to read my comment.
