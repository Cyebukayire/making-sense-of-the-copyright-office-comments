Artificial Intelligence in its current state is able to steal from any artist or person that uses the internet. As such, anything created by Artificial Intelligence is stolen work since it is only an amalgamation of other humans&#39; works. There should be laws in place stopping AI machines from scraping from creators without their consent. No one should have to worry about their own work being stolen. Voice actors are even getting their own voices stolen. Something needs to be done to stop AI.
