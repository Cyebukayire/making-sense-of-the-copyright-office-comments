I am an artist, actor, and writer. AI technologies are currently one of the greatest threats to intellectual property and the methods that they are using to &ldquo;create&rdquo; their content absolutely violates what those of us in the creative fields hold dear. Copyright law needs to close all potential loopholes that those who engage in AI creation will try to exploit to steal the property of others. This needs to happen now. We can&rsquo;t have half measures, thinking we&rsquo;ll fix it later after we see what it does.  It&rsquo;ll be too late by then. If we go down this path, we need regulations in place to audit where AI is getting it&rsquo;s materials from and make sure that the owners of those materials are fairly compensated and credited.
