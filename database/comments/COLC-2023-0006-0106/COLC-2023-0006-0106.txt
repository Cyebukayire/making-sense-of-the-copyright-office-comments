I strongly encourage the US Copyright office to reserve copyright for sentient, self-aware entities. I have serious concerns about the repercussions for professional writers and artists should AI generated works be allowed to have copyright protection. As a freelance writer, I see increasingly frequent attempts to avoid paying writers for work and/or use writing by un or underpaid humans to fuel AI language models. From a worker&rsquo;s rights perspective, AI should not be able to have copyright protection.
