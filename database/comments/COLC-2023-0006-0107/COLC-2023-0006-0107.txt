I do not like AI at all. <br/><br/>The corporal greed to cut on cost for actual real work. Everyone is always making claims that no one wants to work and the reality is that AI is taking the jobs out of real people. Not immigrants. AI is doing it. That is not taking into account the amount of damage it&#39;s making the environment. We&#39;re already in deep into global warming and the mass use and abuse of AI is only making it worse and worse. <br/><br/>Stop AI.
