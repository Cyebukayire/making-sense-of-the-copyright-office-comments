The copyright office must take quick and decisive action against the publicly hidden and wildly illegal actions of AI developers who are training their AI models on copyrighted work created by humans. They have already been trained by scraping countless millions of works registered with the USCO. These AI companies stand to make enormous sums of money by leveraging (e.g. stealing) copyrighted work from artists and creators without proper compensation or credit. This is theft on an incalculable scale. These technologies are derivative, not transformative, as they exist simply to replicate existing works and are unable to operate without human ingestion of copyrighted training models. Put simply: these AI models would not function without the illegal use of copyrighted work. In fact, the entire business models of AI developers are dependent on the illegal use of copyrighted work and their business would collapse with proper legal enforcement of protected works. No matter how powerful these products may prove to be - a business that is fundamentally unable to abide by long established legal principles of copyright law is not a viable business. <br/><br/>It is imperative that a regulatory framework is established to protect humans&#39; copyrighted work - requiring public transparency for what is fed into AI training models as well as proper record keeping and compensation for all works used. If an AI company is unable to pay for the fair use of copyrighted material in developing and marketing their business, then they should not operate in a commercial capacity. We must hold AI developers to the same standards as all other commercial enterprises. <br/><br/>Further, they should not be permitted to scrape anything posted by users on social media.
