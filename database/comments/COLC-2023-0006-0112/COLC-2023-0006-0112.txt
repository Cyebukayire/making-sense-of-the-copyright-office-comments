As an author, I am grateful that the Copyright Office has refused to grant copyright to AI-generated works, and I believe that is a stance that must be maintained. The creation of art requires intent, and requires a living, feeling artist. Not only must AI-generated work not be subject to copyright, all copyrighted material must be off-limits to the datasets and training of language models until and unless the creators opt in. &quot;Opt out&quot; options are not sufficient, and there must be both civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized use of such material in AI data sets.
