These generative machine photocopy theft machines should in fact be regulated. The entire reason we have copyright law in the first place is to protect an individuals right to their own intellectual property, whereas these machines have no intelligence and thus, cannot actually create. They can only steal other people&#39;s work and hope for the best. Besides, watching TV shows by actual people is more interesting because a machine doesn&#39;t have the memory of all the times it&#39;s siblings sold them out to mom but also you can speak entirely in Disney and the barbie movie quotes at each other. That&#39;s going to make for much funnier writing than anything a misleadingly named &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; can do. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re really asking for much honestly, just &#39;please don&#39;t replace real people and the stories they love creating and we enjoy with 200 shows of the exact same premise by a machine can&#39;t tell any new stories&#39;. <br/><br/>If you want an example, look no further than the extremely popular CSI shows and how well all of them but Cyber did. Cyber was so dreadfully boring that even the CSI name, which was hugely popular and everyone still talks about them, couldn&#39;t save the bland writing from getting it cancelled after three seasons. 3! The original NCSI show is still going to this day! The real problem with shows getting cancelled after one these days is because studios don&#39;t want to pay people a living wage, and AI is only going to make this worse. Please do something before all the big broadcasting networks go bankrupt because nobody wants to watch their five different versions of beige shows.
