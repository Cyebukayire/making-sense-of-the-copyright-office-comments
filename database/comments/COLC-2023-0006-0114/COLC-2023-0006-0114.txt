I cannot support AI-created content receiving copyright protection. There is the precedent of non-human creations not being eligible, of course, but additionally allowing automated and potentially infinite creations these protections cheapens the concept of the copyright as a whole.<br/>On the other side of the coin, if these models gain their value from their ability to draw from the works of others be it their art, music, writing, vocal performances, etc. the model is clearly violating the copyrights inherent in those artistic moments. It is artistic theft made simple and automatic, with the goal of claiming a computer amalgamation as personal expression. It isn&#39;t.
