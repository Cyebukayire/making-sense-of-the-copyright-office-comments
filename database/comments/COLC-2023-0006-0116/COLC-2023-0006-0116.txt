I am an artist and writer, and AI being used on both of these mediums not only violate copyright laws due to scraping work without consent being put in any way, shape or form, but it is actively preventing the economic flow  to my work that I have trained decades of my life to do. I have no fame to my name that could even protect me in the brunt of the economic crash we are seeing in the creative sphere due to the direct violations made by AI.
