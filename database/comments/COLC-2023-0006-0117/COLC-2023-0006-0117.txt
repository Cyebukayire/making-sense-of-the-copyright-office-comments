I am an artist, performer, writer, and am very concerned about AI. I&#39;m a background actor currently on strike because studios I have worked for want to steal my image and use AI to imitate my work without compensation. I have made book covers professionally, and now major publishers like S&amp;S are using AI generated book covers without the permission of the artists whose work trained the data sets. I am a writer and I am afraid of people feeding my writing to an AI without my consent. I believe a solution is to broadly prohibit the use of AI generated materials for commercial use.
