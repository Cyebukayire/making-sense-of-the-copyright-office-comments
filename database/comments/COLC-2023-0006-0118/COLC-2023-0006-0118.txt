I&#39;d like to start out by saying that I am a professional artist, and I have a lot of insight on the matter. Not just because I have m brand to worry about, but also because I have seen the attitude and conduct behind the people using AI to generate art for sales, and recognition. The fact is that AI cannot produce new artwork. It samples existing images based on the hard work and talent of other people. It&#39;s a shame that I should have to explain the principle of plagiarism, but if you use someone else&#39;s words and stitch them together in a written report, it&#39;s blatant plagiarism. It&#39;s the same thing where art is concerned. AI does not consciously put in the time, or the effort that it takes to learn these skills. While I understand that every artist is inspired by something, as &quot;prompters&quot; are so quick to mention, neither the prompters nor the AI is capable of making it truly their own. Truly unique, in other words. There is already law that protects artists of all kinds from plagiarism. Even fair use laws have limitations.<br/><br/>AI generation is a tool that does nothing to discourage the use of other people&#39;s work to train the AI models without the consent, or knowledge of the artists. The only work these people have to put in, quite literally to type in a prompt in all cases, and in some cases, feed the stolen artwork into the system.  Mind you, AI does have its legitimate uses. There are many types of AI. And even AI generated images can be helpful, as long as the generated image is not part of the final product. But in terms of assisting with organizing a composition, or ideas FOR REFERENCE ONLY, I personally think it&#39;s alright. But that is not the attitude behind the prompting community.<br/><br/>The fact is, and I can personally certify, that prompters are the same sort of people who complain about websites like Patreon being a paywall. It&#39;s people who treat art are a right, not a luxury that people have to work for. The art people make is every bit a product they have to work to create, and if they want paying for the work, then they should be paid. That is a hallmark of capitalist society, and it should be protected. Furthermore. They will say things like &quot;artists are being elitists&quot; who &quot;bully&quot; these thieves into giving up their &quot;rights&quot; to use our work without our consent. They say we are attempting to control the artistic market. The fact is that if they put in the same work, there would be no question of &quot;bullying&quot;, or &quot;control&quot;. This is the same argument that motivates piracy, which is illegal. Some of them even use AI generated images to harass the artists they steal from for daring to make some of their work Patreon exclusive so they can make a buck in this harsh economy.<br/><br/>Artists are facing enormous difficulty making a living as it is. And each of these artists are, in their own right, small business owners. These endeavors to steal our hard work, such as NFTs (which were proven to host stolen, unedited artwork for sale by grifters), and now AI generated art, which use frankly another attempt by the same people to gain money, or recognition based on other people&#39;s work, are destroying are small businesses and taking away our God given right to work in this country, when some of us literally can&#39;t get stable work anywhere else. I implore the people of this office to please consider the big picture here... no pun intended. We provide a service, charged through websites like PayPal and the like. Those sites take fees per transaction and those transactions are taxed by the government. We play a big role in funding the government, and should be therefore protected by the government. The thieves who take our work don&#39;t pay a dime. They certainly don&#39;t pay anything that can be taxed. And fully productions using AI as the bulk of their workforce, deenriches the whole world, not to mention denies us jobs in the industry. Especially now that AI models are sampling their own images and breaking more and more. Well, it should tell you that an entertainment industry run by AI will entertain no one. And you need entertainment to boost morale and frankly prevent insanity within the working class. Everyone needs some escapism. Please help preserve the quality of our escapism and motivate your tax payers.
