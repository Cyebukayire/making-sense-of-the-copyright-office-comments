We absolutely need responsible AI regulation. Already online spaces have been flooded with generated content, thereby stripping the usefulness of these spaces when all you see are the same 3 images in 500 different variations. People at the bottom of these creative totem poles will be suffocated out of spaces and jobs without responsible AI regulation. Within not even a generation we will see hundreds of creative fields go dead. Already I have friends who have lost their jobs due to AI being implemented irresponsibility within their companies. Without responsible AI regulation, our already suffering job market will continue to decline. It is not enough to listen to the creators of these AI tools. We cannot take their recommendations when they are set up to gain the most. Why else would they recommend it? They do not want to have a failed product but the fact of the matter is, they do not have any product at all. These datasets were taken without consent, infringe on copyright, and should be punished as such. If that means they no longer have a product then that means the US law is working! We cannot make exceptions, or ignore the problem just because it means the destruction of something convenient. The creators of these tools must be held accountable for the illegally obtained datasets and dramatic effect it is having on the market and livelihoods of people within creative fields.
