I am a software engineer by profession as well as a hobbyist artist and writer. So-called AI art and writing generation programs do not actually generate art or writing. What they do is take things that people have made through their own hard work and creativity and output pieces of it, then claiming to have created a new piece of art and writing. Often this is done without the permission of the original creator. If AI-created works are allowed to have copyright, innovation in art will be stifled. The ability of artists and writers (and actors, given efforts by studios recently to increase the use of AI-generated likenesses in movies, as highlighted by the recent WGA/SAG strikes) to earn a living would be stifled, stifling the ability of these creative individuals to earn a living and continue to make art and writing. AI-created content is thievery. It&#39;s not created by a person. There&#39;s no creativity involved, only math. The closest thing we have in art would be collage, but even a collage artist makes choices and uses their judgement to pick the images they combine to make new art. AI-created content, whether in writing, art, in a movie, in a voiceover, should not be allowed to have a copyright.
