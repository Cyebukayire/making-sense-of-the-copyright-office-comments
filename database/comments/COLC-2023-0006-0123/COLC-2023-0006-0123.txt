The production of art and publication, release, or exhibition of said art is synonymous with the granting of explicit consent for that art / content to be seen, interpreted, and consumed.  Studying existing artwork to interpret, deduce, and infer style and technique as a means of learning how to produce art is a part of every artistic curriculum on the face of the planet, and will continue to be such for as long as such education exists.  Artificial Intelligence and Generative Technologies are not &quot;copying&quot; art that they are exposed to.  They are being trained on correlating stylistic technique to verbal prompts and are being taught what &quot;art&quot; is through demonstration and exhibition -- just like an organic human mind would learn.  There is absolutely no copyright infringement occurring with the use of Generative Technologies and Artificial Intelligence.  The training that these systems undergo is not plagiarism and is not in any way, shape, or form derivative in any sense that would violate existing U.S. Copyright Law.  Advocates against this technology are modern day Luddites who do not understand the technology that they are criticizing.  They are fueled by emotion rather than logical, rational thought.  They have no desire to research and learn the basis of what they are criticizing, and the involvement of the U.S. Copyright Office should be entirely limited / constrained to the governance of the issuance of Copyright Claim to the prompter / producer of Generative Works, which SHOULD be subject to the same exact Copyright Protections enjoyed by traditional medium artists.
