Current copyright office guidelines as well as current rulings regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence and copyright are correct. Images, books, articles, poems, etc. created via Artificial Intelligence platforms should not be granted copyright.  Users or AI platforms are little more than project managers instructing a tool trained on stolen works of art to generate the most likely version of an image based on probability of what color the next pixel should be or what probability determines the next word should be.  The human creative endeavor is what we should protect and need to protect.  Boiling down millions of hours of artists honing craft by stealing their work and importing it into to a probability engine is insulting and unworthy of copyright and no human creativity is involved.  If I told another person to write a book or paint a picture, I wouldn&#39;t receive the copyright, the writer and artist would.  Works generated by AI platforms are simply requests made millions of artists at once.
