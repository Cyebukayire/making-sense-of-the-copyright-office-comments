While a non-person entity like a corporation may hold copyright to an IP, they do so after having contractually compensated an artist/writer/human creator for the labor of the IP&#39;s creation.  The generative software we are referring to as AI not only has been built without contractual compensation, credit, or even permission of the artists whose work forms the referenced catalog for the software&#39;s applied algorithm, but also there is no contractual relationship between the software and a user who feeds it a prompt.  On this basis the material generated by AI software is no more eligible for copyright than the melody of birdsong.
