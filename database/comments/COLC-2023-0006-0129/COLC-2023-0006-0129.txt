As an artist and writer of copyrighted works I think steps need to be taken to prevent so called AIs from using copyrighted works as they have done. AIs deliberately designed to make copies of artworks using artist own works to train on need to be banned and definitely shouldn&rsquo;t generate a copyright for their owners. <br/>The big thing between an AI and a digital drawing program that may turns words in pixels is first that the artist makes choices, there is a person making interpretations. The &ldquo;owners&rdquo; of AI will  admit that they don&rsquo;t know what collections the so called neural network makes - and they have little control over anything but the training set. Who is accountable when it comes to AI works? <br/>The fact that all AIs are trained using copyrighted work without permission, and that they wouldn&rsquo;t work without the corpus of currently copyrighted works makes all output fruit of the poisonous tree to borrow a term &mdash; unoriginal copying of a person&rsquo;s moral work. <br/>Finally AI has a very detrimental impact of the availability of work for real human creators and artists, the same creators and artists it stole from. <br/>So both the trained AI/neural network and the output unless proven free of unlicensed use of copyrighted work should not get a copyright. <br/>And training a for profit AI doesn&rsquo;t qualify as fair use. <br/>Of course I&rsquo;m an artist so I&rsquo;ve simplified the software aspect of AI. However I&rsquo;ve tried to summarize what I see is the issue with AI, based on real world problems of AI generated artworks over paying the cost of a commission, fake books under an authors name  listed on Amazon, and artist struggling to balance having images to share with real humans over a large enough watermark to stop them from being trained and stolen by an AI.
