The use of AI in all fields needs to be regulated very strongly. If should be used to assist humans not replace them. Writing, performing, making decisions of any kind doing any sort of job- this need to be super limited and expedite NOT replace. If you keep allowing careers to be outsourced to AI how will capitalism work? Your worker bees will won&rsquo;t have money to spend anymore. If you can&rsquo;t see the ethical ramifications of replacing people with algorithms maybe the financial implications to the economy will sway you. If you let AI replace people that live paycheck to paycheck then I hope AI replaces senators and lobbyists.
