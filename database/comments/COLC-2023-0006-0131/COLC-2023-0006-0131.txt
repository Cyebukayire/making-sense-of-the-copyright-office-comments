AI is an existential threat not only to the livelihoods of everyone who creates with words, images, and their own bodies and voices, but to objective reality for our entire society. If we start to depend on AI-generated &quot;first drafts&quot; for our school curricula, our legal documents, our technical manuals (all things that are already happening), we will quickly find ourselves in a situation where we do not have a reliable standard for information at all, and it will be a Herculean task to find our way back again. AI is a tech-bro chimera, and the less oxygen we give it, the better off 99.999% of humanity will be. It should be and must be regulated to death.
