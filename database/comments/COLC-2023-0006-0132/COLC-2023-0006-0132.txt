Everyone should own the rights to their own voice; using AI or voice filters to put words in someone&#39;s mouth that they have not actually said or printed, and are fully against lending their voice to such statements, is tantamount to slander and impersonation. The rampant spread of misinformation must be cut off at the head before it can grow into a beast that cannot be tamed. People must own the rights to their own voice with regards to commercial projects; restrictions must be placed on already-trained AI datasets to remove any trace of work the inputter had no permission to use. The storm that would follow if AI were to be unregulated would be dangerous for people and governments alike.
