I&#39;ve been an artist my whole life. I&#39;ve never went to college for formal training nor have I ever needed to, my skills as an artist were completely self-taught and is a skill I have honed and crafted since I&#39;ve been able to hold a pencil and visualize just what I wanted to create. God has gifted me with this ability and I&#39;ve grown into someone who has worked in animation and illustration from sheer skill alone. Thousands of hours of my life has been poured into my craft. <br/><br/>Anything created by AI is all just fed and regurgitated work of the hard-working artist and writers who have constructed these skills for years of their lives. These frankensteinian creations have formed divisions among the consumers and the creatives. Studios and execs are using this technology to take work away from actual human lives in favor of saving a minuscule amount of their bottom line. It&#39;s both theft and exclusion. <br/><br/>Having art without a human soul makes no sense, because the essence of art is an extension of the person themself, and I don&#39;t want to live in a world where artist and writers can no-longer make a living off sharing parts of their soul. Machine and machine learning tools are soulless and the quality will suffer. AI needs to be put under strict regulation and companies should not be able to utilize stolen word-vomit as a means of creating and profiting. <br/><br/>Greed has it&#39;s grips in this country and I will not stand the consumption of the arts as another pillar that has fallen to capitalism. Make AI heavily regulated. Abolish it even.<br/><br/>
