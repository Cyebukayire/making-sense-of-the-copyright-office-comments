Art, by its very nature, is the ultimate in human expression. The act of copyrighting is to protect this expression. The images, sounds, and words put together by artificial intelligence might mimic the expression of a person, but they are not genuine. At most, an AI that been trained to copy an artist, will produce a soulless imitation of the artist. When the artist has passed away, it&#39;s a very ghoulish thing to do. If we want quality art, we must respect the artists, and copyright is the very least that can be done to respect them and their work.<br/>As an artist, I can&#39;t compete against the staggering amount of content that can be generated by an AI, even if it needs to be edited by a person. No artist can. By giving AI any amount of legitimacy or protection will destroy art and artists.
