As a writer and consumer of information and entertainment there is a clear difference between creation and skillful regurgitation of news, fictional stories, humour, art and creative media.  AI consumes a thousand original &lsquo;man-made&rsquo; sources and puts forth a hybridization of all that it draws from.  It cannot by definition have an original take or do journalistic investigations.  It simply complies and reorganizes the work of others.  Thus, nothing it creates can nor should reasonably be granted a copyright.  To do so would rather violate the earned copyright of those who created the content it &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo;.  Moreover it should be charged for using these source materials from which it liberal draws from to render its product.<br/><br/>AI has huge potential in medicine and as research tool in law and many other fields.  All this should be taken advantage of.  However, corporations intent on using its ability to draw from existing copyrighted work of actual working people to avoid having to pay them for new work poses a threat not just to the meaning of a copyright but to the livelihoods it is supposed to protect and originality it promotes.
