Hello, I am an artist in Minnesota, and I am concerned about unregulated AI because of how it threatens creative livelihoods and how easily it infringes on individuals&#39; copyright. The technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little to no tools to protect themselves. Laws and regulations could help ensure that this technology is used in the most responsible way possible. They would also provide protections for copyright holders and working creatives (artist, writers, ect).
