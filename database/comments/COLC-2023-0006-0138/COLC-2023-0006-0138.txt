We can&rsquo;t let Silicon Valley once again completely disregard established precedent and law to disrupt and corner markets. They have already scraped millions of works to train their models, without permission and consent, under the ruse of non-profits, but then turn right around and sell these models to their partners. Generative AI is already built on fraud and theft.  Copyright law already firmly states that works created by people are protected. AI is not and should never be considered a person, works created by LMM should never be protected.
