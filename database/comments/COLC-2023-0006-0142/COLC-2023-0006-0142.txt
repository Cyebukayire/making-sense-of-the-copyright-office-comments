It is not ethical for AI companies to build their models off the backs of creators just for it to be sold back to us and replace us. The data sets need to be completely scrapped and should only rebuild with data that was acquired with consent, credit and compensation. Finally, because AI output is not created by humans, it is not deserving of copyright.
