1. I believe AI, when used for non-creative and manual intensive tasks, can be a hugely beneficial piece of technology. However, when it is used to generate &#39;creative&#39; pieces of work, it not only saturates the marketplace and infringes on people&#39;s intellectual property, but it can also cause massive damage to the integrity of creative work. Copyright is the incentive to create original works and it is the foundation of what holds the creative industry together. If AI works were allowed to be copyrighted, there is no logic anymore. It is entirely unsustainable to allow AI to be copyrighted, as it legalizes data laundering. For example, when an artist creates an original piece of work and owns the IP, it can be easily run through a dataset, to then be used by anyone and everyone. It unravels the industry and can cause massive disruption to contracts and trade. The only feasible way for AI to do minimal damage to this industry, is to only allow its usage for non-creative and tedious tasks.<br/><br/>9.1 Yes, consent should be required for both commercial and non-commercial uses. If a generated image was shared in the same community or portfolio site as the original artist, then it can cause damage to that person&rsquo;s business and income; It will saturate the demand for that work, causing damage to the original artist. The very existence of the AI image is enough to do the same amount of damage if it were commercial use. <br/><br/>9.2 An &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; approach is not feasible for individual copyright owners, as this requires a vigilance that is impossible to achieve. It would require the owner to find every single insistence of that work in datasets. This does not stop the issue of other people just adding the work back into the dataset, with the process having to repeat itself. The only feasible method would be to adopt an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; approach, where no work is added to the dataset unless stated by owners.<br/><br/>9.3 Yes. The process of gaining permission from owners in advance is not only possible but a much more ethical way of building a dataset. It would allow for a more fruitful discussion on copyright and the ethics of AI usage. It would avoid infringing on copyright and mitigate the risk of deepfakes. <br/><br/>9.4 The current remedy for infringement is no longer suitable. It does not provide enough protection and rights that will deter the unlawful usage of the owner&#39;s work. If infringement takes place, the rightful owner should have the powers to take the case to a body that can deal with the dispute quickly and effectively. The proof of ownership could be through metadata, blockchain or a series of facts that led to its creation. There should be tougher penalties to deter the behavior from happening again. <br/><br/>9.5 Yes. Creative work is unique to every individual. The work produced is under the agreement of specific terms. It should be argued that when a piece of work is made for a company under contract and is then used in a data set without consent, it leaves them liable for breach of contract. This gives the original creator leverage to object to its usage or hold the company responsible. <br/><br/>9.5 This should be obtained through contracts, specifying what work is allowed to be added to the dataset.<br/><br/>10.1 Yes. Similar to a freelance contract, it is feasible to hire individuals to provide or create work that can be added to datasets. <br/><br/>18 No. Even If the generative AI system is trained on the work of that individual, it is still using a generative algorithm that is producing work based on patterns and shapes, not on human input. The output is entirely automated and there is not enough control to allow for human intervention. If a piece of work was produced with the help of AI to automate the non-creative aspect of the work, only during the process and not the final output, then there is grounds for arguing that it can be copyrighted. <br/><br/>19 The core value of copyright should stay the same. There must be a certain level of human input for it to be subject to copyright. If a piece of work uses AI, then that person should not only prove that it was used non-creatively but also that the work could have been made without AI. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>20 No. Legal protection for AI generated material is undesirable and poses a threat to existing industries. It is not deemed necessary enough to develop AI technology. There is no evidence to support this to be the case.
