Hello, I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little to no recourse. Unregulated AI is absolutely a threat and something that needs to be treated as such. Reasonable regulations will protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense. So please, help protect us. I am a United States citizen from the state of Missouri, if you need this for any reason. Thank you for your time.
