The use of AI is a slippery slope that needs to be nipped in the bud. Using and the potential of copyrighting AI poses great threats to human creativity, jobs, creates too many opportunities for corporate abuse and exploitation of human labor/likenesses/intellectual and creative work. The federal government should take clear and precise action to prevent such abuse and exploitation now, before such use of AI becomes the norm and difficult to stop due to corporate power and institutional inertia. I am a history professor and I think that AI does not present an opportunity for students but rather another supposed tool that only serves to limit their capacity to think, analyze, and understand the world in which they live. The state of higher Ed has already become too corporatized and compromised by &quot;free market&quot; consultants that have turned education into a transactional system wherein teachers are to feed students data and they cough it back up with little thought or analysis, where they trade their time for a piece of paper, rather than a process of human engagement and learning that benefits not just teachers and students but communities as a whole.
