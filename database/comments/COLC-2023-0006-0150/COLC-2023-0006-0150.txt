All generative AI works rely on the input of previously created intellectual property, often from other individuals, and are therefore not meaningfully original works. There is no way to adequately cite individual works that contribute to the learning model or program, which means that products from that program utilize others&#39; IP without acknowledgement, compensation or other appropriate recognition. A model or program developed entirely from one&#39;s own intellectual property could feasibly generate copywritable works, but citation of the use of that tool should be required in publication. With all works derived from generative AI, citation should be clear, including the type of program used and where the program&#39;s dataset originated. AI is not capable of generating actual intellectual property, and therefore should not be considered a &quot;co-author&quot; or creative partner. Rather, it is a tool; artists do not cite Photoshop as a co-creator of art but typically acknowledge it as a tool used in creation. Not setting clear rules about citation leaves countless creators vulnerable to theft and exploitation.
