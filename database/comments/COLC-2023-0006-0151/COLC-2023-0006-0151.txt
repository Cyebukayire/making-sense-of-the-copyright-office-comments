Generative AI is essentially propped up by plagiarism; AI is &ldquo;trained&rdquo; by scraping materials from the web without consent, then using those materials to inform a predictive algorithm. AI can and will reproduce copyrighted works on demand, and its ONLY purpose is to plagiarize. AI users should not be permitted to copyright their works, nor should AI creators be given leeway to profit off runaway theft.
