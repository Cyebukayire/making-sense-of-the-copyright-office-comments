This new technology has opened the door to so many new possibilities we havent even thought of yet.  With AI i&#39;ve learned to sing by hearing my own voice tuned to the perfect pitch.  The possibilities are endless.  I understand people using AI for terrorism and other dangerous things, but please dont lock down AI to the point we can&#39;t recreate music or videos.  AI is not infringing on copyright.  Its a recreation a new version of something that already exists.  We can look at any new song traditionally released and its the same concept.  Please be careful about this... we need the freedom to explore what this technology can do for us.  Don&#39;t let money ruin it.
