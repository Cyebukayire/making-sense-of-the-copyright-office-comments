Hello, I am a modeling artist in the Animation Movie Industry and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/><br/>This technology has already done terrible damages to the illustration fields but also the voice acting field due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. The US gov NEEDS to step up and ensure that our rights and copyrights are protected against illegal scrapping.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time,<br/>A concerned citizen
