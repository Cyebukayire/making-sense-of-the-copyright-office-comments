Artificial intelligence is a tool and therefore should not be copyrighted, not even for the user who created a piece exclusively using said tool, as this user would not have actually created anything, the system would have created it, and mainly taking into account that such tool uses in its database creations stolen from real humans who have studied and specialized for years to paint/write/create. Not only do I believe that generative AI should not be copyrighted, I also believe that these AI tools should be regulated to use absolutely nothing in their databases without the consent of the human creator and putting an &quot;opt out&quot; approach is not enough for this, as it should be expected that the person who created the item would not want a machine to steal their creations and later take their jobs using plagiarism.
