Works produced using any portion of Artificial Intelligence should not be allowed to be copyrighted. Fundamentally, the nature of A.I. is one of theft. The corporations who manage the datasets that A.I. draws on have openly admitted that they&#39;ve scraped billions of sources created by hardworking artists and writers, stolen the products of those creative labors, and then stored that stolen work in a database to continuously profit off the stolen work. This is a dangerous precedent that threatens the livelihood of anyone who creates professionally and hamstrings new creatives who are entering into the field. Please do not allow A.I., even output that has been &#39;edited&#39; by a human, to be protected by copyright laws, as doing so will only ruin the ability of workers in these industries to earn a living while enriching billion dollar corporations who wish to profit off the hard work of these individuals without paying them what they&#39;re worth. I would also ask that you look to the datasets these A.I. programs run on and shut them down for the most flagrant violations of copyright law in modern memory. Thank you for your time and for opening this subject to public opinion.
