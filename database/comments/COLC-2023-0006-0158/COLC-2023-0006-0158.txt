Copyright law protects the works of individuals and ensures a fair, competitive market for creatives. Artificial intelligence can only produce content based on data that was used to train it, including particular styles, references, concept, tone, use of color in art, etc. Individual human creatives often develop these skills independently and produce a unique voice based on how they interpret these different components. Thus far, there&#39;s been no precedent for AI to produce its own styles - it can only copy the styles of a particular creative or source material. Moreover, AI has no means to credit the creators of their original work, and can&#39;t cite references or inspirations like a human creative can. Copyright law should not apply to a computer program that&#39;s incapable of producing an original voice, can produce infinite variations of a concept without human intervention, and cannot self-validate that the work it&#39;s produced isn&#39;t copied wholesale from an existing work. Even the prompts provided to artificial intelligence must be inherently based on existing concepts and references, since the artificial intelligence must have equivalent training data that it can correlate the provided query to. While there&#39;s a place for artificial intelligence in the production of creative works (such as by generating reference concepts from a set of training data wholly owned by the creator), modern usage of artificial intelligence is too rudimentary to be considered original and not inherently derivative of an extant work.
