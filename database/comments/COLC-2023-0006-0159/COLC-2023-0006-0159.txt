The world of ART is vastly appreciated and underappreciated.  For an artist to IMPROVE, their art form requires a work ethic for growth, and time to learn, and embrace inspiration all around them.  Artists (writers, designers, painters, cartoonists, etc.) can&#39;t grow and evolve if they have to also go wait tables at the local cafe down the street... b/c they can&#39;t afford rent anymore, thanks to Artificial Intelligence taking everything they&#39;ve worked for, without consent, and using it to create something easily thrown away, or something very profitable.  <br/><br/>Also artists won&#39;t use A.I. the most.  Executives, with minimal talent (at best) will.  It will rarely be a tool to help those already capable of creating art.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a SLIPPERY SLOPE... Before long, the inevitable conclusion will be less artists and LESS ART in our world.  All so lazy non-creative types can continue jumping the line, and standing on the shoulders of artists and teachers of history.  Our world is NOT better off, with less artists.<br/><br/>I urge you to PAY ARTISTS for their work, as A.I. manipulates it into whatever fleeting desires executives command.   Or, just outright, don&#39;t allow it.  If you can teach A.I. to draw, that might be different.  Right now, you&#39;re just teaching it how to steal.
