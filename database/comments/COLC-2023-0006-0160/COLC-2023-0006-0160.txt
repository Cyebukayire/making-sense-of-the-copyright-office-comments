As an illustrator, cartoonist, general visual artist and creative professional, the use of generative AI in creative fields is highly concerning. I have already witnessed countless examples of artists not only having their portfolios of work scraped and used for AI data training without permission, but also many examples of artists&#39; names being specifically used as prompts to generate AI images resembling the work/style of these artists. In some cases, there has been a flood of non-consented AI images tied to an artists name, to the degree that searching for their work online pulls up the AI images along with their actual work, causing confusion over authorship. I firmly believe non-permitted use of data (writing, visual, audio, etc) for use in AI/machine learning programs that will no doubt be used for commercial or artistic purposes is wrong and a violation of copyright, and that these programs pose a real threat to creative expression and the ability for creatives to make a living. Also considering the generated works are not created with purpose by a human (to the degree that users of these programs often have trouble recreating a similar image twice because they have no control over the algorithms), I do not believe the generated works would be copyrightable, even if they were generated from public or consensual data. Thank you for your time.
