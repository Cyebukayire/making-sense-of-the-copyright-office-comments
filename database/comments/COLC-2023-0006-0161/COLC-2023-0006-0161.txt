I am an artist. I occasionally copy work. I understand that copying work is to improve my skills and eye-hand coordination not to make salable materials. Copyright protects me if I create something new. If I try to sell a handmade version of a Disney character, I expect them to try to block me. Our laws have protected copyright for years. Turning the system upside down to allow a new type of copying the chance to be a product is unAmerican. I don&rsquo;t sell cassette recordings of radio broadcasts, I certainly don&rsquo;t remix other people&rsquo;s work into a compilation and sell that. Artists need to have some rights over their creations or they can&rsquo;t afford to make art. Please regulate AI and do not allow it to scrape data from stolen sources. Please do not allow AI to hold copyrights on slightly altered materials just because the software is new and flashy.
