AI generated content should NOT be able to get copyrighted under any circumstances. It is important to realize that AI does not creat original works, but uses information gathered from pools of work made by actual, living people. This includes pictures, writing, voice work, and any sort of artistic medium these days. Those who use AI to generate material they wish to use for their own purposes have no right to claim the results as their creative property since they did not utilize any sort of creative skills or talent/ability.
