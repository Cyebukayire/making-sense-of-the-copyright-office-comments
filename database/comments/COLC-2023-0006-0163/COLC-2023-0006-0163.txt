Artificial intelligence and anything created from it, or generated, should not be eligible for copyright. Generative AI effectively runs on plagiarism, AKA taking other people&#39;s works to create something else. This is not even transformative, as AI often just copies and pastes pieces of said work into a mesay jigsaw puzzle of writing, imagery, or music. Generative artificial intelligence is very difficult to even call &quot;intelligent&quot;. It doesn&#39;t generate things in a meaningful manner, such as watching chatGPT shows that generative AI becomes more inaccurate over time, rather than learning and becoming more accurate with time. The source is here: https://fortune.com/2023/07/19/chatgpt-accuracy-stanford-study/<br/><br/>Both in my experience as a creative person and a business person, and as a former academic, I&#39;ve watched generative AI be used mainly by my colleagues and students at my alma mater for a few things:<br/>1) to generate business decisions for them. At my private firm, an employee put in a bunch of business ideas and concepts into chatGPT for them to come up with business plans for them. They went through with the business plan, but only went so far as they realized that it was disastrous. My company also tried to replace all of our marketing analysts and copywriters with chatGPT, which also went poorly, and thankfully we never got rid of anybody.<br/><br/>2) to generate fake art, and try to copyright the fake art, and the real art that made it that is not their own, as their own to profit off of it. as posted in many places online, many people will throw in a myriad of art pieces into artificial intelligence, for them to generate art that is an amalgamation of all the art they put together, and it&#39;s hard to even call art. It doesn&#39;t make it well, and it looks soulless, but worst of all, these people will try to pass it off as their own, that they made it with their own hands specifically, and then try to profit off of it, even though all they did was type words into a box for 30 seconds. Even worse, they will try to copyright that work, along with another artist&#39;s actual creative work under their nose. <br/><br/>3) to generate academic answers and papers. At my alma mater, I&#39;ve heard from friends that continue to work or study at the university hearing about copious students using chatGPT to complete their homework for them, or to write papers for them. This defeats the entire learning process, and worst of all, almost everything in those papers and assignments are wrong. Worst of all, even if they are passable, people will try to publish that work on their own, and many of these papers get flagged for plagiarism, as the AI will just copy and paste paragraphs from other people&#39;s published work onto a document. Sometimes, people try to publish these academic papers privately, and some may try to copyright their work, which again is not even their own work, and is simply pieces of other people&#39;s legitimate work jumbled together in a way that is more than likely completely inaccurate.<br/><br/>With this together, artificial intelligence is a potentially dangerous tool, and a hack tool at that built off the backs of people who actually did their own work, only to be used to make money off of other people&#39;s hard work and to pass it off as their own without compensation. Since nobody is being compensated fairly for the use of their work, let alone compensated at all, let alone is their work being used with their consent, I do not believe that anything generated by supposed artificial intelligence should be eligible for any form of copyright, let alone making any profit off of it, whatsoever.
