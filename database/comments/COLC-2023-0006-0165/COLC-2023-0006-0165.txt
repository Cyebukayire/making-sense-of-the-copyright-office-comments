I strongly oppose any allowance for generative AI to be trained against copyrighted material, or granting any copyright to AI-generated material. <br/><br/>While AI has it&#39;s uses, it absolutely should not come at the cost of human artists, experts, authors, or other creators&#39; hard labor. Theft of copyrighted material to be ground into algorithms is far beyond what anyone intends when they put their work into the world, whether as something shared over social media or on an art hosting site, or as purchasable content such as published books. Nor should the public ever have cause to doubt whether the work they are engaging with is the result of human effort or of machine regurgitation. And finally, the idea that someone could copyright something computer-generated, solely because they got the machine to spit it out first, is simply absurd.<br/><br/>I hope this office:<br/>1) puts the strongest possible limits against the use of copyright-protected material in AI training sets<br/>2) requires that any content-sharing platform or publisher that wishes to share copyright-protected material for the purposes of training AI seek Opt-IN (not Opt-Out) permission to do so from each user<br/>3) continues to deny any copyright protection for AI-generated material
