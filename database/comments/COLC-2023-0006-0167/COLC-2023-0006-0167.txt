Re: Copyright Office<br/>[Docket No. 2023-6]<br/>Artificial Intelligence and Copyright<br/><br/>I am making this submission on behalf of myself.<br/><br/>General Questions:<br/><br/>Question 9<br/><br/>Answer,<br/><br/>There should only be consent obtained from copyright holders for the use of their works to be used by AI training.<br/><br/>This is because AI generators are essentially a replacement technology. They are designed to mimic human creative works and ultimately replace artists, writers, photographers etc with an autonomous vending machine. The idea that this should just happen without any consent from artists, writers, photographers etc. is utterly ludicrous.<br/><br/>In fact as I understand things the term &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; is related to a misreading (by AI advocates such as Andres Guadamuz) of EU Digital Single Market Directive (DSMCD) Article 4 which allows copyright owners to opt out of &ldquo;research&rdquo; and is not meant to be applied in connection to commercial use or machine learning for artificial intelligence. This is because it would violate Berne Convention Article 5 (2) where no formality is required for copyright protection. Having to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; would be an illegal formality.<br/><br/>The words &ldquo;commercial use&rdquo; don&#39;t even appear in article 4 of DSMCD. The words in article 4 are, &ldquo;for the purpose of text and data mining&rdquo; (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790)<br/><br/>NOT<br/><br/>&ldquo;for the purpose of commercial use&rdquo;<br/><br/>And NOT<br/><br/>&ldquo;for the purpose of Machine learning&rdquo;<br/><br/>Text and Data Mining has a legal definition in article 2 (2)<br/>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790<br/><br/>Thus it is clear that text and data mining means &ldquo;research&rdquo;. Not training AI systems!<br/><br/>So it is completely false that there is any copyright exception for &ldquo;commercial use&rdquo; in the EU for artificial intelligence training. The &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; provision is only for opting out of research.&rdquo;<br/><br/>So it&#39;s rather foolish to even discuss &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; or &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; with regards to commercial AI vending machines. Consent is always required as there cannot be any formality to &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; for copyright protection! Copyright protection is automatic on the creation of a work! No other conditions apply!<br/>
