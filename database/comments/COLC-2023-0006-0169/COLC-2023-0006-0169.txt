Hello! I&#39;m a freelance &amp; creative writer and I&#39;m concerned about the implications of granting AI-generated work copyright status. First of all, these programs tend to scrape existing sources without consent, resulting in amalgamations of several authors who go uncredited. Second, even when AI does include quotes or citations, since these programs are predictive rather than truly intelligent they sometimes manufacture sources, actively perpetuating misinformation. Third, these programs are often used as a workaround to paying human writers since industrial-grade plagiarism is cheaper. Therefore, I&#39;m opposed to the granting of copyright to AI-generated works both on practical and ethical grounds.
