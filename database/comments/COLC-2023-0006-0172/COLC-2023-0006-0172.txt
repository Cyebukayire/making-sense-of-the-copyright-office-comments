Hello, I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/>This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse.<br/>Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
