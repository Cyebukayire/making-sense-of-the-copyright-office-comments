AI as we know it (ChatGPT, etc.) is first and foremost not true AI. It&#39;s machine learning, and has shown serious degredation in quality over the past few months. It is, at this point, only used for plagiarism, and the only future plans for it I have seen include using it to avoid paying artists(see; voice actors receiving contracts that, if signed, allows AI to be trained on their voices for future projects they will receive no payment for; authors receiving contracts allowing AI to be trained on their work with no compensation, etc.). It cannot and should not be allowed in any work or project under copyright.
