The use of computer programs generally referred to as &quot;AI&quot; in the common vernacular (eg; Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, etc.) are not actually true instances of Artificial Intelligence. They are instead tools built to pull samples of photographs, illustrations, audio, and writing en masse from the internet, regardless of the author/creator&#39;s permission in order to combine said instances in a single output similar to a newspaper collage. The problem with these programs is twofold: they are/were created with the intention of copying/imitating existing works by real people, and they are marketed as replacements for the type of people whose livelihood is taking photographs, making illustrations, recording audio, etc.<br/>Despite claims by proponents of &quot;AI&quot; programs, a majority of users of such tools utilize them to copy, impersonate, or otherwise plagiarize the work of others in an attempt to benefit financially by means of misleading others into believing such works were either created through legitimate means (such as digitally painting a picture by hand); or, in the event of pure plagiarism, impersonating an artist, photographer, actor, or writer outright. <br/>We are already seeing &quot;AI&#39;s&quot; intentional creation as a mimicry program being used maliciously against the American workforce: the AMPTP has stated their intention to use the ChatGPT program to scrape hundreds, if not thousands, of scripts in order to &quot;generate&quot; screenplays without the need to pay a real person or group of people to write a story for movies or television. Due to the way the ChatGPT program operates, it would be impossible to guarantee that the source material would be completely Creative Commons, and would therefore include scripts written by screenwriters and authors that did not give permission for their work to be utilized by the program, and whom would also not be compensated for the use of their work.<br/>There are dozens upon dozens of other examples of &quot;AI&quot; being used unethically, whether it be foraging guides with life-threatening misinformation being published on Amazon under false author names, or a deceased artist having their artwork ripped from their portfolio without the permission of their estate in order to sell prints on the internet. <br/>In its current form, and in the way it is currently being used, there is no ethical way to use &quot;AI&quot; programs. While advocates for &quot;AI&quot; will continue to make the claim that such programs will further progress in technology, writing, and art; their true intentions are to monetarily benefit from the legitimate works of others without any knowledge, skill, or contributions (fiscally or otherwise) of their own to such pursuits. <br/>Because of this, &quot;AI&quot; should be heavily regulated, if not outright prohibited in its current form, in order to protect the rights of people whose hard work, dedication, and entire livelihoods are at risk for being completely and entirely plagiarized for the benefit of wealthy corporations looking to further squeeze margins and scammers/bootleggers looking to make a quick buck.
