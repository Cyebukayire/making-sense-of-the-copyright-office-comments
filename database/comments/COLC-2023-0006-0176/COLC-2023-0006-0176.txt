AI is not human. The US Copyright Office and the courts have already determined that works created by non-human entities, such as the macaque selfies from 2011, are not subject to copyright. Works created by AI models, until and unless AI achieves legal personhood, should be treated the same as the macaque selfies. Transformative works done by humans based on works created by AI models, such as the cover for Christopher Paolini&#39;s novel &quot;Fractal Noise&quot;, should be eligible for copyright as transformative works, but works created by AI models should not be eligible in and of themselves.
