Re: Copyright Office<br/>[Docket No. 2023-6]<br/>Artificial Intelligence and Copyright<br/><br/>I am making this submission on behalf of myself.<br/><br/>General Questions:<br/><br/>Question 9.5<br/><br/>Answer,<br/><br/>Abolish &quot;work for hire&quot; laws! <br/><br/>These laws strip copyright away from artists (only humans create copyright not legal entities) and give them to corporations way below the future market value.<br/><br/>Thus depriving artists and writers of fair copyright remunerations. <br/><br/>&quot;Work for hire&quot; is fundamentally wrong!<br/><br/>In the case of VFX workers or animators for instance the principle director may not even be in the building. Animators may also film themselves on their phones for reference. So these things make them authors of film works more than the director! It&#39;s unfair that they don&#39;t benefit from their work!<br/><br/>So get rid of &quot;work for hire&quot; before artists are fully stripped of their rights and AI owns everything! to the detriment of all creative artists.<br/>
