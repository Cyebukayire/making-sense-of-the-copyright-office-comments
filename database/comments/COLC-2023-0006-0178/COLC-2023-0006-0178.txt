It needs to be illegal to use copyrighted works to train AI art software without the express permission of the artist. The use of art without the artist&#39;s consent allows for an art program to replicate that artist&#39;s style and therefore devalue that artist&#39;s work. In a landscape where artists already struggle to make ends meet, this is potentially devastating. The law needs to catch up with the technology in this area as soon as possible. <br/><br/>In a similar vein, it should be illegal to use AI to replicate the voice and likeness of an individual without that individual&#39;s express consent to do so. This similarly devalues an actor or voice actor&#39;s work.
