Since AI scrapes data from various sources and uses materials that human beings have already created, one should not be able to copyright any material produced by AI. It is far too easy for companies to scrape data off of any public website, search, or forum. It should not be legal to do so without proper consent, as AI has a great potential to violate the existing copyright of actual human beings.
