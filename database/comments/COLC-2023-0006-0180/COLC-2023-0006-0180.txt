As a professional author of novels, short fiction, comic-books, and scripts for film and TV, I respectfully urge the U.S. Copyright Office to refuse to recognize any application for copyright for any work, in any medium, generated in whole or in part by an adaptive or generative artificial intelligence or language-learning model. The indiscriminate use of such technologies threatens to flood the market with low-quality &quot;AI fiction,&quot; which publishers could use to push down authors&#39; already diminished wages. Copyright is meant to encourage innovation by human beings &mdash; not to enable the suppression of our creativity by machines.
