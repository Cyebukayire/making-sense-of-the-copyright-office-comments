As an artist and a writer, it is clear to me that, without strict regulation, AI is being used to rip off artists, writers and creatives of every kind. AI work is not built from nothing but from the years of labor of any creator the AI has been trained on. Even in the most &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; of uses, these models pull from across the internet at the whim of folks who seek to under pay and cut out artists. In my opinion, these users, leeching off of other artists and writers, should not be able to copyright these frankensteined works. They should also be held in contempt for feeding pieces Willy nilly into their models to create similar work! Please block AI users from copyrighting the work of others and from benefitting from their serious breech of others&rsquo; creativity.
