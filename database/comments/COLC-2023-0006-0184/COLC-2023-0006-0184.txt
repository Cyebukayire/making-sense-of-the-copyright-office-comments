I don&#39;t believe AI works should be copyrightable. AI is trained on work created by visual artists, writers, actors, voice actors, and other artistic professionals (called &quot;artists&quot; from here on) as well as journalists and other writers. Using AI is weaponizing artists&#39; and journalists&#39; own work against them. <br/><br/>When anybody can make passable art with AI, there is less drive for consumers and corporations to pay artists for original work or original research. Artists, already often in tenuous financial circumstances, would be forced to give up their calling. <br/><br/>Under the rule of AI art, our culture would stagnate. New ideas and techniques would not be invented.<br/><br/>Many other trades and businesses would be eliminated, moving all work to computers. Live theater and dance would become things of the past, taking with them restaurants and (to a degree) fashion. No one would make paint. <br/><br/>Perhaps more troubling is AI&#39;s encroachment on journalism, cutting out the crucial layers of primary research and critical thought. Readers need well-researched information and human-pondered ideas, not algorithms. When we lose journalists, we lose truth, and we teach people that they don&#39;t need to learn to think for themselves, either.
