AI is built off of and trained on copyrighted materials, often without permission from the author or creator or their estate. As such, any work created by AI should not be considered an original creation and no copyright should be granted to the person seeking legal protection. This is much different than an author using a typewriter, or a graphic designer using a digital color pallet. <br/><br/>AI &quot;artists&quot; argue it takes time and skill to craft a work from one of these programs, but that is often because the program itself continues to spit out piece after piece of content until one of those is determined by that &quot;artist&quot; to be of sufficient quality for whatever project they are working on. Thus, if copyright is to be given, it should be granted to the algorithm, the AI itself, and not whoever created the prompt. <br/><br/>Therein is the problem, because that algorithm is built on a body of work that many people did not consent to or even dream of this being a possibility. Consider the author who&#39;s book was published, but has been digitized by a company and then scraped by an AI crawler. Short of never creating a work in the first place, there is no way that author would ever have been able to prevent their ideas and intellectual property from entering the library that an AI can pull from. <br/><br/>If the U.S. Copyright Office moves forward with copyrighting AI creations, there also must be in place a robust appeal process, by which artists and authors can file a claim and royalties or damages if they can prove the work contains elements of their art and works.
