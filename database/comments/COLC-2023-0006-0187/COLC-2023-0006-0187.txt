First and foremost, all AI works are generated by STOLEN CONTENT. All models in play are trained on information that the original copyright holders did not consent to have used for training purposes. Companies such as X, Alphabet, and Meta are all rolling out AI systems designed to STEAL CONTENT from their userbase WITHOUT THEIR INFORMED CONSENT based on decades of material submitted to their platforms.<br/><br/>Speaking as a professional artist, the argument that &quot;AI is a tool&quot; is nonsense. If you take away Photoshop, I can still draw, as I have spent a lifetime developing that skill. If you take away an AI system, so called &quot;prompt authors&quot; cannot create anything.<br/><br/>There is also a safety concern. Currently on Amazon.com, AI generated books about fungus are being sold. These books can and will cause harm and death, as they describe certain poisonous fungus as safe for eating.<br/><br/>Allowing AI works to be copyrighted will create an economic incentive for more corporations to irresponsibly use AI instead of relying on the value of human experience and knowledge, which AI cannot come close to replicating. All works created by AI are created to simulate syntax, not meaning. There is no value worth protecting in these works. <br/><br/>
