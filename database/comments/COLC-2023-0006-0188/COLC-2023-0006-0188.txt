AI is stealing. It steals the hard work of all the incredible artists, actors, and writers who are human beings who need to make a living. It will put millions of people out of jobs and will steal the work of these creatives without giving them compensation or credit. It&rsquo;s disgraceful and inhumane to not create policies that protect creators work and their rights to keep their jobs and support themselves and their families.
