As a consumer and an artist, I think generative AI is really harmful without the right regulation. This AI defaults to infringe upon the copyrights of many artists&rsquo; artwork as their works get feeds into the AI without their, either by companies or by individuals that are not the artist themselves. Furthermore, this AI can potentially hurts the quality of the entertainment for consumers, as certain bias can be contain among these unregulated data and there can be harmful and hateful content being  generated. Lastly, without regulation, this AI has become a enemy to human creativity as it robs the livelihoods of creatives. Thus, I strongly suggest the government that create legislation that prevent anymore acts of stealing from creatives and protect the basic rights of creatives.
