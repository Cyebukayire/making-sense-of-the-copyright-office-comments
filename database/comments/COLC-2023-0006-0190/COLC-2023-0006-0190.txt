I&#39;m a freelance writer who has become increasingly concerned with the unregulated use of LLM&#39;s and other forms of &quot;AI&quot; due to it&#39;s rampant misuse of copyrighted materials and impact on the livelihood of my fellow workers&#39; livelihoods. This is a grotesque misuse of what could be a powerful and brilliant technological breakthrough and the only thing holding it back from BEING a thing for good is proper regulation in terms of where it can get its content, how it is allowed to be used, and so on.<br/>Reasonable regulations must be put in place to protect copyright holders and working creatives and I believe they can be done so without hindering innovation.<br/>
