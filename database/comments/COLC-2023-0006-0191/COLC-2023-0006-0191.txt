I am an attorney practicing law in California, with experience practicing entertainment law. Copyright is intended to promote creative endeavors by individuals, but if AI generated content were to receive protections, it would promote the opposite to the benefit of corporations in the entertainment space who are already achieving record profits at the expense of sole creators. <br/><br/>Ignoring the very real problems of AI generated scripts and other content putting thousands of Americans out of work, there would be nothing to stop corporations running powerful AI engines around the clock to generate copyrighted AI content, which they could then use to threaten individual creators who happened to naturally create similar work. This probability is far from remote, as advances in computing power and AI are allowing such content to be generated at unprecedented speeds. In short, if you imagine the old adage about monkeys using typewriters to create Shakespeare, it will not take long for supercomputers using AI to ultimately generate  many thousands of Shakespeares, each demanding copyright protection at the expense of human beings.
