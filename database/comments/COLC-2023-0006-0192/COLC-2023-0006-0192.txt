&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; or what&#39;s being called &quot;generative A.I.&quot; is not intelligence by any stretch of the imagination. It cannot make anything on its own. Only an intelligent sentient being could do such a thing. It, like any other program or machine, must first be told what to do, and how to do it. That is not intelligence and those that have sought to steal the likeness of &quot;style&quot; for the sake &quot;creation&quot; are likewise unintelligent and cruel in their representation of their want. The have abused public trust in such a manner as few others before for the sake of their own profits. <br/>Only those possessed of a sentient freewill can truly craft artistically. These &quot;A.I.&quot; programs are naught but machines that must be told what to do and how it must be done, not unlike a car and a car has no rights. They exist as tools and as such must be regulated, but this &#39;generative A.I.&quot; is much worse for it is their makers intent to remove the human from creation. Instead of applying such tools to practical problems the programmers opted instead to try &#39;democratize&#39; a form of thought and execution that cannot exist without sentience, without being. What they have made is empty, collages mashed together and now these very tools are being used to create NSFW images of people who do not wish to be a part of it. How is that even allowed?<br/>The law must act and with great urgency to stop the development of &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; at all costs.
