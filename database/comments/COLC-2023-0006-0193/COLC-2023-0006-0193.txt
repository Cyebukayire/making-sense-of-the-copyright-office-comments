The art we create is what separates us from our beloved animals. Our need to create is driven by the need to heal, to tell each other stories, and to connect. In a world in which we are already so divided, the use of AI to take over our art and even our livlihoods leaves us without purpose, and I fear, more divided. The United Staes should be known as a haven for human expression. We currently attract the greatest minds in the world here because we support innovation, new technologies, and  freedom of expression. Instead of fearing the advancements other countries might make because of AI use, let&#39;s support our intellectuals, our artists, our humans to remain the leader in human advancement. The work of AI should not be able to have copyright, because it can only be the plagiarism of all human works that have come before. Let&#39;s use it for the good of humanity, of course. May it help us advance medical cures, but at the hands always guided by a human mind. If not, then what are we even here for?
