I am a professional working in the field of audio design &amp; engineering, with a specialty in dialogue, as well as being a voice actor. As such, I believe I am uniquely qualified to give perspective on why it is imperative that generative voice AI (and generative AI in general) be properly regulated before its usage gets out of hand and damage is done that cannot be reversed.<br/><br/>I have seen colleagues have their work and voices stolen to be fed into generative AI models, where their voices are effectively puppeteered and forced to say horrendous things that they never would have even considered saying themselves. The publicly available generative AI services that facilitate this kind of behavior always absolve themselves of any responsibility because there is currently no legal framework to prosecute this behavior. This is very common with characters in games, animated media, and films, and there is currently no legal recourse whatsoever if a person has their voice stolen in this or any other manner. Because these algorithms are a &quot;black box&quot; and very hard to study in a way that exposes how they were trained, it&#39;s very difficult to know whether a model was trained on copyrighted material or not, making it problematic to identify outside of obvious cases like sites designed to replicate the voices of specific people.<br/><br/>Given how easy it is to access these models and just feed whatever one feels like into them, there is serious danger in AI-generated media being allowed to be presented for copyright. If voices are generated from an actor who did not give permission in a project, it could potentially tarnish or destroy their careers and lives if words that they would never otherwise say were &quot;put in their mouth&quot;, so to speak, and presented in an official manner.<br/><br/>Due to the recency of this technology, there also often are no clauses at all in contracts that cover work that could be fed into a generative AI algorithm. This effectively means that there is no legal recourse for actors who have their voices fed into a generative AI algorithm without their permission as a result of being hired to work on a completely unrelated project.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it is not only irresponsible, but potentially dangerous to allow AI-generated work to be come copyrightable. I would implore you to consider the careers of both well-known and lesser-known voice actors, screen actors, and artists when weighing your decision on this. AI and similar technology should be used to ease productivity requirements so humans can focus on more fulfilling arts, not the other way around.
