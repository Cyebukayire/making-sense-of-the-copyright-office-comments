If art, products, and media can be made entirely through artificial means, and be protected in the same manner as human made, it will de-incentivize anyone from producing similar work in their own. <br/><br/>That would be a hit to culture and stagnation as art and media made through the press of a button will be derivative and lack any ability to make any poignant commentary or statement based in current cultural climates. <br/><br/>AI tools can be helpful as an assistant in the creation of work, but if businesses and corporations see more monetary benefit in using a single computer program to create, it will kill hundreds of thousands of jobs and effectively destroy art and culture in the country. <br/><br/>A creation process utilized by a human being, where the majority of the work done by said human being, must be the litmus test for copyrights and protections.
