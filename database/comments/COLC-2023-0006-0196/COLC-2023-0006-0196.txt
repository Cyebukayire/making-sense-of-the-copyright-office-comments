I believe that no AI-generated product should be eligible for copyright protection. As it stands, AI-generated products are simply scraped bits of human-created visual art, writings, music, and other works that are thrown in a blender. There is no work on behalf of the AI or the programmer running it that is original; everything is taken from something else without the consent of the creators of the scraped works and is presented as a completely new product. Anything AI-generated is no more the creation of its prompter than a wedding cake is the creation of the couple. There is no unique or original property of anything that is AI-generated, and thus there is no reason to offer it copyright as it is little more than the slapdash plagiarism that a student who wrote a book report at the last minute could do. I urge the US Copyright Office to refuse the protections and privileges of copyright to any AI-generated product. This privilege should be reserved solely for works created by a human, not something that a computerized blender spat out after devouring the hard work of others.
