Artificial Intelligence is not only the product of stealing what already exists, often copywritten material, but it&#39;s a spit in the face to any and all creative outputs. The hours of hard work people put into their creations, only for people to take those, put them in some machine and replicate them fairly convincingly is a testament to how this is not a good thing. How long until works of art are created with 1:1 accuracy? This will put many creatives out of work, as freelance artists will have a tougher and tougher time finding work, and corporate studios will replace all the hard working writers, actors, animators, sound designers, because they will not only be able to save tons of money, which they do not need to do, these studios are raking in hundreds of millions of dollars every year, but will set a precedent in the future that this is okay, which it&#39;s not. How long until AI starts being able to take over jobs for politicians? Or AIs are going to be taking over for these corporate CEOs? This is a path towards a dystopian future where misinformation can be created far more easily and convincingly, but spread at an unprecedented rate. AI needs to be heavily regulated, and phased out of existence, because this can only lead to bad things for everyone. I please strongly implore the US Government to seriously consider this.
