Content created using probabilistic models should not be granted copyrights, as they are not created by any entity with true intelligence or creativity (which is why the terms artificial intelligence is inaccurate and misleading). If the creators of such content are not intelligent or creative, they therefore cannot create intellectual property, and therefore cannot be considered for copyrights.
