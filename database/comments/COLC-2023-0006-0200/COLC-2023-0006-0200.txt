AI can be helpful, but strict laws need to be in place to protect intellectual property and to protect the future livelihood of creators. For menial or incredibly arduous repetitive tasks that don&rsquo;t need creativity, AI can be utilized. But any creative content, idea property, writing, acting, performing, etc., should not be used with AI without strict rules, personal accountability, and human agreement in a situation-to-situation basis. If not strictly regulated from the beginning, lax AI laws will slowly corrode our economy and individuality, (which is a founding principal of our society as a country,) until things completely atrophy. We can always adjust later if things get too myopic but once freed, AI will be next to impossible to rein in if we don&rsquo;t create specific and detailed rules from the beginning. Thank you.
