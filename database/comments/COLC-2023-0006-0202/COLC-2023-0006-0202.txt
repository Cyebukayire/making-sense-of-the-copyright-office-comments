I work for about two weeks generating a model for people to use however they want. I don&#39;t take credit, money, or anything for that matter...I just want to make people happy and this should be a stand for us as humans to BE happy! The only people who complain about AI are obviously not studied on calculus, differential equations, or any of the hard work and brainpower that actually goes into this stuff. Don&#39;t let ignorant people win just because they&#39;re loud.
