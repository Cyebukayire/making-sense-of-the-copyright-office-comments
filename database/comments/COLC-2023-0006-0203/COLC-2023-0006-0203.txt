As an artist, there is nothing worse than seeing your work used without permission or compensation. That&rsquo;s all AI is, a way to steal from artist, plagiarism in a concentrated form. Seeing your work/words/voice/or likeness being used in scenarios you would never consent to or against your beliefs. Not only that, but as it blurs the line between fact and fiction when used as a way to fake photos. AI needs to stopped and all individuals that had their works fed into their systems need to be paid for the stolen works and undue stresses it has caused them.
