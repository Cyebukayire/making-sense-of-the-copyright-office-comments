I want to start off, by saying I don&#39;t have a problem with AI per se. However, I have a huge problem with using my voice and/or likeness for AI without my permission and that is where I see the AI movement is headed.I do not consent for companies to use my data to train and use for AI. I&#39;ve seen so many of my peers&#39; likeness and voices used without their permission and we did not know about it. This is a safety issue, as someone can easily use it for evil and profit. I will only allow AI to be used as long as I consent and receive some sort of payment for every time my voice/likeness is used. But overall, I believe AI needs to be heavily regulated.
