AI does not have permission or rights to utilize artwork that does not have a creative commons license, nor should it have copyrights. AI as it currently exists thrives off stolen artwork, and used to undermine and exploit the labor of human creatives in an effort to cut them out of the process entirely. It grafts together pieces of the images it takes directly off the internet, and swirls into a &quot;new&quot; piece, always without permission or knowledge of artists that their work is in the datasets.
