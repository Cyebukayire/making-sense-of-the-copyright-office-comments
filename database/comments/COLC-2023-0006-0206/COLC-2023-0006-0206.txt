I am defiant opposed to free range AI. The essence of AI itself is using the words of authors who have their work on the internet. Even if those voices of those authors are jumbled up, it&#39;s still their voices, and AI will never be original work. Consumers want original well written stories from people with talent, and we want these people to be paid for the success of their talent. Thank you for reading.
