The government needs to heavily regulate, heavily tax, and withdraw any tax subsidies to ai companies as they are profiting off labor theft and unsolicited labor. <br/><br/>Brute forced algorithms, which is far more accurate term than &quot;ai&quot; or &quot;machine learning&quot; are labor theft: The image generators function by blending together pieces of existing images directly sampled from massive datasets of billions of images scrapped without consent by out of control tech companies, who are not being properly regulated, in an attempt to steal jobs and income from small business owners, IE artists. The text generators do the same for text, it is now being revealed that text generators can regurgitate entire sections from books and the datasets include pirated books. The image generator datasets include private medical photos: Why are companies being permitted to build commercial models off private medical photos? 3D model datasets include models directly ripped from games and models that where illegally ripped or pirated from individuals small business owners. Why are commercial models being permitted to exist when they are based on pirated material like this? Is this the USA or China? The level of IP theft and privacy invasion here is similar to what China engages in. <br/><br/>Why is the government allowing tech companies to go above the law? What is the government going to do when tech companies destroy entire industries and cause millions of people to be unemployed? Will the government continue to provide tax subsidies to these out of control tech companies so they can steal the work of small business owners and destroy entire sectors of the economy, or is the government going to properly tax and regulate this technology? Is this the United states of America or the United States of OpenAI?
