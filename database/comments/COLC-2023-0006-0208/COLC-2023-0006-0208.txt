It&rsquo;s clear that to make AI generated images, videos, and general content is by gaining information from source material that is typically copyrighted. Unlike human artists, there is no way for the AI to reasonably come up with something original, more so than take two separate pieces of content and merge it. I believe that if any AI media is to be sold and distributed it should not be granted copyright protection or be allowed to be sold when it&rsquo;s media is created through copyrighted sources.
