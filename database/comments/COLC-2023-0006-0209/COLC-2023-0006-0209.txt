Please do not allow Artificial Intelligence companies and/or users be able to claim copyright over the images they &quot;create.&quot; Much of the AI tools that currently exist come from stolen assets, which is not only highly illegal, but emotionally and financially hurtful to those who have had the artwork scraped and used for things out of their control. I have personally been a victim of this, as I&#39;ve seen my own works being &quot;claimed&quot; by other people for use in projects I did not create for nor authorize. The use of Artificial Intelligence has been one of, if not the, biggest obstacles of my professional career that I&#39;ve faced in the 15 years of professional illustration. Active job listings for proper freelance work have become highly competitive because the few people out there looking to hire a human artist have become scarce as more and more companies turn to use stolen assets of AI to &quot;make&quot; works. This issue goes beyond just art, and into scenarios of AI voice and video, which lead further into the rabbit hole of what it&#39;s used for and how well it gets away with it, including creating fake news images or even pornographic imagery of real people who don&#39;t consent to the use of their likeness in those situations. Please put a stop to this once and for all and relieve thousands of people who continue to be actively hurt.
