1. AI generated works over saturate and devalue any type of creative work. People who work in the creative industry already know too well that it&#39;s hard to make a living for a lot of creatives and companies will take shortcuts wherever possible. Throwing genAI works into the mix will make the lives of creators even harder because it&#39;ll flood the market and devalue any type of creative work. It&#39;ll lead to job loss because now a company has less incentive to hire more artists, because now they can generate whatever they want with a click of a button. It is already affecting jobs and if copyright will be granted to those works it&#39;ll only get worse and ruin the complete creative industry<br/><br/>GenAI that has been fed with countless of copyrighted work and the whole library of artists everywhere now is now suddenly a competitor to those artists because the algorithm can spit out similar work as specific creators completely ruining the selling point of an artists ability to market themselves.<br/>There is no benefit to creators. The only people benefiting from this are the companies offering the genAI services and own the data sets. Creative companies will profit because they now get more output for a fraction of the cost and needing to hire less people.<br/><br/>In almost all cases where creative work is used licenses/copyright/consent has to be bought beforehand. So why should training genAI which only has one purpose &quot;Replacing of human workers&quot; be an exception here? The lifelong work of creatives is actively being used against them without consent from neither the creative nor the client it was created for.<br/><br/>2. The sheer amount of work genAI can spit out in hours drowns out any competition.<br/>Also no other market feeds on human work and data like genAI does. This is an unprecedented event in copyright history.<br/><br/>4. House of Commons Culture, Media &amp; Sport Committee Connected tech: AI &amp; creative technology Eleventh Report of Session 2022&ndash;23 (https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/41145/documents/201678/default/)<br/><br/>5. Since right now any sort of training is done under the fair use defense. Fair use needs to be specifically addressed that it doesn&#39;t cover the use of copyrighted material for training of generative AI.  We have multiple instances where training has been done under the goal of &quot;research&quot; but then those data sets are being used by corporation to fuel their commercial products. (Data Laundering)<br/><br/>6. Bots are searching and scraping the web indiscriminately. (Even if websites have a robot.txr to tell a bot that they don&#39;t allow scraping there are multiple bots and newer bots who disregard that. So it is up to each website owner to research and write new exemption to those specific bots don&#39;t scrape their site. But at that point the damage is already done since the data has already been acquired)<br/>Also people are targeting and scraping specific creatives to use their works for fine tuning already existing data sets to mimic specifically certain artists. (this website is one of the more famous ones: https://civitai.com/ )  Multiple artists have already asked for their stuff to be taken down but with no success.<br/><br/>6.1 So far the biggest data set done for research is LAION 5B which includes billions of images scraped from the internet (not just creative works but everything from selfies, xrays, porn (illegal or not), violent images etc.)<br/><br/>6.2 As of right now there are consensual licensed works from creators offered for training. Adobe says their genAI (Firefly) is only trained on legit works but multiple artists have cried out that their work is being used without consent. Adobe has also in the past weeks openly display failure to comply to their own rules by selling genAI art that mimics famous artists on their stock site.<br/>(https://pioneersperspective.com/innovation/ahead-of-a-full-firefly-launch-internal-documents-show-adobe-wrestling-with-how-to-spot-ai-images-how-to-pay-creators-for-training-data-and-a-possible-opt-out/)<br/><br/>7.3 No it&#39;s not. That is why opting out doesn&#39;t work.<br/><br/>8. I believe there should be no exemption cause the training aspect is too easy to abuse for anything else and make it commercial.<br/><br/>8.1 Training as a whole should not be protected under fair use. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s at the start or end during the fine tuning process.<br/><br/>8.3. As mentioned for point 8. Fair use should not apply at all for training of AI. In every instance consent by the copyright holder(s) needs to be required.<br/><br/>8.4 genAI is competing the same market as the people it acquires the training data from. This already goes against any type of fair use argument.<br/><br/>8.5(see 8.4)<br/><br/>9. Opt in is the only things that works. Creatives are already busy with their work. It&#39;s impossible to keep up with any new DATA SET and see if their work was used. Also once trained data can&#39;t be forgotten. So opt out doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s also impossible to prove if the opt out has been honored.<br/><br/>18. No copyright for AI<br/>
