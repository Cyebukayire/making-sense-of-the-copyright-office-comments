Generative AI today uses the results of human intelligence and creation (without permission or compensation from those creators) to produce outputs that seek to replace the work of those same creators in the marketplace. The owners of the companies that built generative AI also seek to have the outputs of those machines declared to be copywriteable. <br/><br/>It is clear in the history, legal precedent, and original intent of copywriting that only a human creator can make something that is copywriteable. That standard should not change, as it is intended to encourage the efforts of human creativity, intelligence, and hard work in order to better our society and benefit the market. Assigning that value to the output of a machine would undermine the basic foundation of copyright.<br/><br/>Additionally, allowing generative AI to utilize copywritten material without permission from or compensation to the copyright holders in such a way that financial benefits flow to the generative AI creators and actually *replace* jobs that may have otherwise gone to the original copyright holders is not in line with fair use, nor is it of benefit to our society. Generative AI companies should get the permission of the copyright holder for the use of any copyrighted material if they are going to receive any financial compensation (directly or indirectly) for the use of that material.
