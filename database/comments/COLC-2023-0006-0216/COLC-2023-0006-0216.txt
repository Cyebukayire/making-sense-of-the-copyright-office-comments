All A.I. can do is sample other sources and copy other artists. Humans can create and be inspired by other humans. A.I. can not create. A.I. can only steal from other people. Many of which is already copyrighted material.<br/><br/>The main aspect that makes art art is its humanity. Any form of art created by artificial intelligence is...artificial. It rips away any humanity from art. Copyright is a law for human created art. Not artificially created art.
