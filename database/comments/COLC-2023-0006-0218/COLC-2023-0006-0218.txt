Artworks created by AI using prompts and drawing its content from the copyrighted works of other artists should not be copyrightable, as it is not an original artwork created by an artist. There could be some wiggle room regarding the wording of whatever prompt is being used, in that the specific wording is copyrightable, but not the resulting images. Thank you for taking the time to explore this issue!
