AI work is generated by taking bits from actual human authors. Sometimes this is something that cannot be protected under copyright, but people shouldn&#39;t be able to make profits or gatekeep content that has been created by someone who spent time and effort and love creating something to share with the public just to enrich our communities. It&#39;s unconscionable to allow AI learning to take from actual content creators without their express permission, to then spit something out using their work. It takes away commissioned work from artists, it decreases the chances for actual human work being published, etc. The biggest issue I have is what is taken by AI tech companies for the machine learning aspect. People who use AI generators and then try to capitalize off of it are stealing from the creators and putting no effort into the product. They shouldn&#39;t be rewarded. In the example with the graphic novel, the writing should be subject to copyright but the AI generated art should not. If someone wants art that they can own, they should either learn to make it themselves, or pay those who have invested time and effort into learning how to do it. There has to be federal protections for creators.
