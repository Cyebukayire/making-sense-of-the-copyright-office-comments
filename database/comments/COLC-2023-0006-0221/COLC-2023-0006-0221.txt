I am actively scared to publish my works, knowing that any generative algorithm can scrape it for &ldquo;training data&rdquo; and twist my words into a half-baked profit-chasing derivative of its own. Though I respect the technology behind artificial intelligence, it&rsquo;s clear to me as a writer and digital artist that stricter regulations are necessary to curb the existential threat AI poses to art itself. To that end, though I am not a policymaker, I have some suggestions:<br/>1) Full transparency in source data and data harvesting methods. I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s current form, many commercial AI are trained by scraping the internet without consent or even knowledge from artists. AI developers should be transparent about the data included and the sources of said data, so that artists can have an easier time requesting their works removed from the training set.<br/>2) No copyright on generated material utilizing copyrighted works. I feel as though this one is straightforward, as generating a script or image based on someone else&rsquo;s work is just bootlegging with extra computing power.<br/>3) Job security for workers affected by AI. Again, a fairly obvious one, given actors and writers alike are striking due to Hollywood wishing to replace them with AI generated writing and AI generated likenesses. Though you can&rsquo;t quite regulate whole sectors of labor, there needs to be protections in place so corporations can&rsquo;t pay peanuts to replace whole swathes of the workforce.<br/>As mentioned, I am not a policymaker and these are all suggestions. However, regardless of what form this change takes, *something* needs to change. Our current laws around AI are simply incompatible with modern labor and any form of creative integrity. I do not know perfectly what steps are necessary, but something must change!
