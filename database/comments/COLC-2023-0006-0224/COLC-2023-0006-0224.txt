AI that can only generate images based on the hard work of real artist who will go uncredited or compensated, is exploitative by nature. The only ethical way AI could be used commercially would have to use in house samples from an consenting artist who will receive credit and compensation is the only way moving forward if we even want to talk about bringing this technology into the workplace. The way AI is currently functioning is going to cause distrust between artists and companies and bad, uninspired art. If you want to capitalize on art, frankly, you have to respect artists and their art.
