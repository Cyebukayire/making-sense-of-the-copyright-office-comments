Artificial Intelligence generated images, texts, etc. should not be considered eligible for copyright protection. Artificial Intelligence is incapable of actual invention, and instead produces statistically likely results based on provided training data sets. As such, allowing any person, persons, or group to copyright Artificially generated material allows them to own and possibly profit off of material that they did not create.<br/><br/>There should also be stricter regulation of the training data sets used by Artificial Intelligence makers, as the use of material the AI creator does not have rights and/or permission to use is a serious issue. The use of copyrighted and personally owned intellectual property without permission from the creator/owner in order to derive statistically likely results based on that property is damaging to the rights of all individuals to protect and own their own creations.
