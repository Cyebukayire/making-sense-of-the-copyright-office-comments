AI should absolutely, under no circumstances, be allowed to train off of copyrighted material. Especially copyrighted material belonging to individual artists or artists unaffiliated with a specific company/corporate entity. To train off of such works is blatant theft. This may be different were an artist to give explicit written permission for their work to be used for AI training purposes, but it should otherwise be disallowed. AI works are also undeserving of being copyrighted. At most, people generating AI works are entering pieced together word prompts which are then used to generate a work based upon the previous works of other human artists. That in itself should not be enough to automatically grant copyright to the person who used AI to generate the work. Stringing together correct prompt combinations to ensure the desired result is not work worthy of copyright. There is no ethical granting of copyright to any kind of media generated by AI which was trained off the backs of working creative humans, whom in many cases reject the use of their art to be used for AI training. AI trained to mimic specific voices/art styles/etc. of current or previous existing artists, actors, or other creatives/public figures should be considered a breach of unfair competition legislation in applicable jurisdictions.
