As a freelancer who makes a full time living through my artworks, my stance is very simple : Being made to compete against machine learning algorhythms that use my and millions of my peers&#39; work without our accord doesn&#39;t sound like lawful competition. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, the datasets are full to the brim of stolen contents and assets, and as I&#39;ve been told by someone who specializes in machine learning in a big data environment, datasets for machine learning have to be very carefully disclosed and can only be used to a commercial end if the people using them have a license to do so. I don&#39;t understand how GenAI has come this far, on this scale, with so little legal repercussion on that end. Are we, as people who have had our assets stolen, compressed, stored and regurgitated into unrecognizeable patchworks, supposed to all individually take legal action against every single GenAI project that uses our work. Making a living as a freelance artist is already notoriously difficult as it is, but this might just be the nail in the coffin for the careers of many.<br/><br/>
