Hello,<br/><br/>I am a voice actress. AI threatens my field of work everyday. In just the last week, I and numerous other people I work with have lost paying work to AI voice over. On top of that, I&#39;m an artist. I used to make a lot of money off of my commissions. I haven&#39;t even sold one commission since AI artwork became available to the public. The works of thousands of artists, most likely including myself, are being scraped from online sites and being mashed together to form works being used commercially whilst paying those artists nothing. We are being robbed of opportunity. As an actor and an artist, I get to see both sides of this - as actors, our performances, voices, even our bodies are being scanned and stolen with AI. It feels like everyday I see another voice actor asking for AI videos of characters they voice be taken down. These videos range from music covers to profanity to racism, sexism and other forms of hate. Not only can this cause an actor&#39;s image to be tarnished, this can also cause an entire company&#39;s image to be tarnished. I want this to end.<br/><br/>Overall, I have high hopes that this will blow over, as all of these things do. People want to see people. The pro AI crowd are a vocal minority and nothing more.<br/><br/>Thank you
