Artificial Intelligence or AI is a danger to artists, writers, singers, and others, it steals art from artists who own that artwork and can become a serious legal issue if not regulated correctly. I think AI is stupid and dangerous if left unregulated. Attached will be copyrighted artists that has had their art stolen to feed the AI to &quot;make&quot; the generated art work. http://laion-aesthetic.datasette.io/laion-aesthetic-6pls/artists?_next=800%2C800&amp;_sort=rowid
