The United States Copyright Office published in the third edition of Compendium of US Copyright Office Practices that &quot;only works created by a human can be copyrighted under United States law, which excludes photographs and artwork created by animals or by machines without human intervention&quot;, and that &quot;because copyright law is limited to &#39;original intellectual conceptions of the author&#39;, the copyright office will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not create the work&quot;. Regardless of who owns the equipment with which art was created, if a human made no creative contribution to the works, then there is no copyright to be claimed.<br/><br/>In terms of if telling a machine what you want is enough to constitute &#39;creative contribution&#39;, it has been shown in other copyright cases that that is not enough. In making a request or buying a commission for art, unless copyright/rights of ownership is given to the customer, the owner of the copyright is still the artist, not the person who wrote out what they wanted (exactly as one would write out a request to an AI machine). In terms of going to get a tattoo, unless the customer actually contributes to the art and or style of the tattoo being made or gets the copyright signed over to them, then the copyright still belongs to the tattoo artist. <br/><br/>From Americans for the Arts: <br/>&quot;Who owns the copyright for a public artwork?<br/>The artist retains all rights under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 USC Section 101) as the sole author of the work for the duration of the copyright. The duration of copyright in the United States is currently the life of the author, plus 70 years. <br/> Title to the artwork passes to the client or commissioning agency/organization upon their written acceptance of and payment for the work, but copyright belongs to and remains with the artist. In other words, although the client may &ldquo;own&rdquo; the work of art, the artist who created the work owns the copyright, including all ways in which that artwork is represented (photos, video, ads, logos, branding), other than in situ (on-site documentation photos).&quot;<br/>
