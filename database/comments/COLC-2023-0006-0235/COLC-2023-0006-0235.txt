Please do not allow corporations to retain copyright of AI. I am a published, successful novelist and worry that my work will be scraped and absorbed by AI, then regurgitated back out in altered but very similar form. This plagarized version would then be sold by the corporation without any true acknowledgement, attribution or payment to its sources. I am also a film/TV writer and know the studios are working to do similar things in that genre as well. This would be devastating for creators.
