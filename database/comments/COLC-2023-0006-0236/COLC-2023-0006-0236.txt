Due to the necessity of AI to use the material of others, copywrited and not, to produce its own content, and the lack of any artist creating the material, AI art cannot be classified as anything but plagiarism, and nothing it creates should be copyright-able. <br/><br/>Furthermore, due to its use as a tool to disenfranchise everyone in the creative field, it should be outright banned from creative spaces and the creators of such tools should be liable tmfor lawsuits/prison time.
