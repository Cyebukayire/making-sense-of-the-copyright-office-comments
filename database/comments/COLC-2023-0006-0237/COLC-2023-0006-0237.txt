Aside from the need to revise copyright law in the US (which is an issue for Congress), I urge the FTC to do what it can to go after each and every AI company (generative AI or otherwise) to sue the hell out of them for using copyrighted material to build their platforms. What an incredible slap in the face to all creative people out there who have &mdash; past, present, and future &mdash; been harmed in the making of current AI models. Creative professionals, or otherwise, in America are watching their occupations become highly threatened by AI and they do not deserve this. Please, please, please FTC &mdash; don&rsquo;t let the AI companies be.
