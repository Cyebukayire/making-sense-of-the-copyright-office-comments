Hi, I&#39;m a student in Master and also an artist and AI is concerning me because it&#39;s threatening copyrights and my livehood. The lack of regulations have permitted AI to do damage against researcher and artist, but also other person in other field. It&#39;s stealing our right, mostly copyright of our products. Unregulated AI is a huge threat because of that, and it&#39;s threatening to my studies and the fruit of my research (hours and hours of research) that can be stole without I can say anything. I don&#39;t want to publish my work online because of that. I understand the need for innovation but it shouldn&#39;t threaten copyrights and working creatives.
