I&#39;m a software developer who studied artificial intelligence at West Virginia University as part of my graduate studies in computer science. I am also a commercial writer of fiction who writes  bespoke works of prose for small amounts of money. I mention this as I feel like I have a useful perspective on both the technical and creative aspects of artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>For every creative work, there is an idea that has a causal relation to each step taken to produce the work, and to attempt to realize the idea. Generative program do not use an analogous process. They do not understand the prompts given to them, nor do they understand why what they generate purportedly satisfies the prompt. This is illustrated quite easily if you ask for a picture of a human hand, as most generative programs do not reliably produce five-fingered hands.<br/><br/>A prompt is something written by a human, I do think a prompt is has intellectual property rights associated. The image or text generated from the prompt, however, should not, in the same way that animals and natural processes do not have intellectual rights to artifacts. <br/><br/>It&#39;s trivial to trick artificial intelligence to replicate any data it is trained on, and it may do so accidentally without human awareness. This is a risk most people do not factor for when posting art on their own personal website, or when they give permission for their art to be printed in a magazine that might be archived and later scraped as a training set. We should assume artists are retaining the right to refuse for their works to be used in a training set unless specified otherwise, in much the same way we assume they reserve the rights to control whom reprints their works. <br/><br/>As mentioned before, a person can certainly commit copyright infringement with generative AI just as readily as they might with paint, or with a pencil, or with a typewriter. All normal liabilities should attach.<br/><br/>In regards to a particular person&#39;s style, this seems to be an issue of trademark rather than copyright. If there exists a likelihood of confusion for the source of the artifact, that&#39;s one kettle of fish, but as humans are free to imitate the masters, they continue to be free to do so with the tool of generative AI.
