1) How AI models should use copyrighted data in training:<br/><br/>AI models should only use copyrighted data with the permission of the original copyright owner with an opt-in methodology (not opt-out). There also needs to be full transparency from now on with where exactly AI models get their data otherwise AI-generated material from that model should always be deemed uncopyrightable.<br/><br/>2) Whether AI-generated material can be copyrighted even without a human involved:<br/><br/>Human creativity is essential for a piece of Artwork. I particularly like the judge&#39;s ruling on this case against AI-generated Art: https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/19/23838458/ai-generated-art-no-copyright-district-court?fbclid=IwAR1rJY_ZzQfv3vmhMyoNIx2FKo20NjU1EAxpS06F8yqpOf7tThfsqQ6eAlY <br/>Especially the part in the transcript about Photography, I will link a screenshot of that.<br/><br/>3) How copyright liability would work with AI:<br/><br/>I believe the companies behind the AI models should always be the ones held liable for using Copyrighted data and not the AI-Art Prompter. If, in the rare exceptions, where the AI-Art Prompter is clearly/intentionally making a derivative work (for instance through an image-to-image interface) then standard liability should apply to the AI-Art Prompter.<br/><br/>4) How we should handle AI possibly violating publicity rights:<br/><br/>It will indirectly help if the Copyright office finds the companies behind AI models liable for using copyrighted data to prevent violating rights of publicity. Not only would cracking down on the Copyrighted datasets do right for the Original Creators, it would also help regulate publicity rights indirectly.
