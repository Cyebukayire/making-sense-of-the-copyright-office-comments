AI is currently being fed copyrighted material and scripts, for which the original writers are not being compensated. It&#39;s basically a plagiarism machine. This will decimate screenwriting. Hip hop music has samples from previous songs throughout its catalog, and there is a system in place to compensate the musicians/writers of those original samples. There is no legislation in place for an AI system that does the same with scripts. There must be STRICT legislation and protection around the use of AI.
