I feel that any large language model (and other AI tools) should have regulations put in place about how copyrighted materials are ingested and the copyright holders be compensated for their work.<br/>The current status of AI tools that are nothing by plagiarism machines makes the creative arts untenable, in an already difficult career field.<br/>I fully support the recent decision to deny a copyright to an AI model creation. Without a human being involved, there should be no way to use these tools for profit, as they are not profiting those whose work they are built upon.
