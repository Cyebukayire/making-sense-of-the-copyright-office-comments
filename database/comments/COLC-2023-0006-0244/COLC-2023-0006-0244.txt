Generative AI currently &quot;scrapes&quot; data from unwilling and unnotified sources who are then most often not compensated for the use of their work in what the AI generates. This is different from an artist seeking inspiration from another&#39;s work because an artist will always be inserting their own talent and sapient creativity into their piece, whereas an AI has no sapience, no true creativity, and is mashing together artworks in a copy-paste (albeit a complex version of it) from different sources as an amalgamation to try to create the image the user requested from the prompt. This takes away jobs from artists and writers who not only have fewer job opportunities as people attempt to replace them with a poor facsimile of creativity, but they can&#39;t even get proper compensation when their own art is being used to make these machines function. AI could function if the datasets were Opt-in only (NOT opt-out, that&#39;s asking for users to be unaware their work is being used and how), and if it were required that artists whose art gets used in commercially-made AI art gets proportional compensation. You could even have it that art that&#39;s used for certain purposes has different compensation requirements so that, say, a non-artist could cheaply use AI to make a mock-up piece to help convey to a hired artist design aspects they expect for an expensive commissioned piece to help save time and improve communication between parties, but so long as the AI art is never used in publication, it&#39;s not subjected to higher royalty rates.  <br/><br/>To be entirely clear, I do not think AI art should be able to be copywritable because the AI work product was made by a machine, a non-human, and therefore there was no sapience or creativity behind it. At best the person behind the prompt is suggesting to the computer what to do and then it&#39;s up to the computer how to interpret the request.
