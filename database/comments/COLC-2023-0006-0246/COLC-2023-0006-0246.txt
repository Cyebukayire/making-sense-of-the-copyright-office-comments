Hello, I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. Unregulated AI is a threat because it uses content without permission to create new content, which then threatens the livelihoods of those who created the original content that is being scraped for data.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Also, reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. It is only reasonable, common sense, and just that AI should adhere to copyright and not use source material without permission.
