I have been an artist all my life, and I think AI Art has its uses but it should not be copyright protected as it is not actually made by a person but by prompts and programming. Is the output of a coded program copyright protected? Are the lines of code that create the output copyright protected? I don&#39;t study copyright law so I don&#39;t know. Still I don&#39;t believe AI created art and writing should be copyright protected.
