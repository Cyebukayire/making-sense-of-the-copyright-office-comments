Context: I am a freelance illustrator. If AI were to fully take hold, I would be out of a job, completely.<br/><br/>AI-generated works, be it writing, illustration, or otherwise, should not be permitted any ground in copyright. Most, if not all, AI-generative algorithms are trained on stolen and/or copywritten works, rendering them nothing more than derivative (if not outright plagiarized) works to begin with.<br/><br/>By allowing AI-generative works any status even close to the work of real human beings, you would be sending corporations a message telling them it&#39;s okay to fire their workers and replace them with these AI models, which, I&#39;ll add, has already been happening all over various media industries. Tell anyone who would use AI to turn a profit that they will hold no copyright, their &quot;work&quot; will not be protected, and, further, any work found being trained on the work of real people who did not give consent is a crime.<br/><br/>I&#39;m fully aware that &quot;whether or not it should be criminalized&quot; is not the question, here. But it truly ought to be criminalized. It is theft. Anyone with a whiff of knowledge on the topic knows it&#39;s theft. Nothing about these AI models is ethical. Nothing about them is conducive to the progress of any media industry. Nothing about them should be allowed.
