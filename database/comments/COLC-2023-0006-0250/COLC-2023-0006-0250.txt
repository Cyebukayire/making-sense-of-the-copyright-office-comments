AI generation programs are built on the stolen, unpaid work for hundreds of thousands of artists, including myself. It is absolutely unethical to allow them to continue production of imagery, let alone be granted copyright for imagery produced utilizing stolen copywritten material and personal work of countless artists. The proposition itself is insulting to the myriad peoples across every discipline of creative work who have been robbed without recourse by shiftless technological grifters attempting to bypass the human beings behind creative fields - to take the artists out of the production of art. <br/>I could not be further opposed to the idea of copyright status being granted to anyone or anything produced by AI. This proposition and open forum is entirely unecessary given that this topic was already solved in the 2014 ruling against copyright claims by British wildlife photographer David J. Slater when it was decided that only works created by a human being could be considered for copyright protections. AI generators are not human beings and thus it should already be decided that they cannot, and shall not, be given copyright protections for their generated works.
