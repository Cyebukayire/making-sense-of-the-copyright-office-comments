To Whom It May Concern, <br/>Thank you for taking a moment to read my thoughts on A.I. -- I&#39;ll be brief as I&#39;m sure you will have many wonderful thoughts from humans and numerous transmissions from robots to sift through. First, I am a WGA writer currently on strike and one of the &quot;hills to die on&quot; is about A.I. -- in the hands of greedy studios it is a way to replace artists, writers and performers. Even if a work of A.I. is eventually polished by human hands in some way, the product is plagiarism. As a comic book creator, we&#39;re wary of AI art - it&#39;s poor quality, like silly putty lifting an image off a comic page. The A.I. that the corporations will turn to &quot;mix-up&quot; elements and regurgitate a story will have been trained on my collaborations. I DO NOT CONSENT to this. And in all my indicia moving forward, I am expressly prohibiting the training of A.I. on my collaborations. It may be a long time, if ever that A.I. can break your heart or make you belly laugh, but the forces of capitalism will not care for quality -- indeed they do not call us writers most days, and they do not even call the product &quot;story&quot; any more they refer to it as content. An attempt to untether it from any responsibility to pay the artists for its use and reuse. We need strong A.I. protections -- and not just in the copyright space. Below please find an example of my new indicia expressly prohibiting my creations from being trained on A.I. If someone wants to train their A.I. on my story -- what is my story worth? We don&#39;t know the answer to that question yet. Thanks again! -- Gerry Duggan
