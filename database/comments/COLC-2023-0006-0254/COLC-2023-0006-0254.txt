AI generated work combines real people&rsquo;s work without permission. If a person did the same thing, it would clearly be unethical. We only question whether AI is the same because it does it faster and is better at hiding it. Claiming that an AI generated artwork is someone&rsquo;s copyright is like putting a musuem together and then saying that all the art within it is your own work.
