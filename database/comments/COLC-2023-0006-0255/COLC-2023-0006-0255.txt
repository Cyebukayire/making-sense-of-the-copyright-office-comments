 A human is involved with Generative AI which should make the output copyrightable. Generative AI still needs a human/person to type in a prompt to achieve a result. I really believe the output of any Generative AI/Generative AI software should be eligible for copyright.<br/><br/>Generative Ai is similar to how digital artists create Photo Manipulation pieces/artworks which is copyrightable. Photo Manipulation involves the transformation or alteration of a photograph and/or artwork. Photo Manipulation takes elements from other works like a puzzle and creates something completely new. Generative AI does the exact same thing, taking elements from artworks and/or photographs and something new is created hence the reason for copyright eligibility. <br/>
