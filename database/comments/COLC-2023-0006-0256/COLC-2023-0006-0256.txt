Hi, I am a software tester and a technical writer in California, and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright, livelihood, and safety.<br/><br/>This technology has already done damage due to a combination of lack of regulations, and both copyright holders and injured parties currently have little to no recourse.<br/><br/>Unrelated AI poses the threat of lazy corporations scraping the writing from other industries, providing suggestions that can prove downright deadly such as suggesting bleach into baking soda for cleaning, or telling an untrained engineer to do something counterproductive for their industry.  It also means that people will keep repeating the same faulty information again and again without looking into the details because of how &#39;easy&#39; it is to get what they consider reliable information.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure that we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.
