Please do your part and block AI generated and AI assisted creations. On the basis of &quot;Naruto v. Slater&quot; it is in the best interest of the United States of America to block these works from being copyrighted. AI generation has allowed for mass production of artistic works directly trained from the internet&#39;s data and will flood many platforms with its content. This will only harm both artists and audiences.
