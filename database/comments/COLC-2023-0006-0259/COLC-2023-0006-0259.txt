I do not believe AI helps. It hinders, especially for independent authors like myself. One fellow author can&#39;t get a scammer to stop using her name under an AI generated novel as the false author. Others have seen their work pieced out and unlawfully used as an AI tool. A person published a book a day after the Lahaina fires... about the Lahaina fires. That had to be AI created. Using this tech without regard and ignoring the harm is wrong.
