Artificial intelligence programs clearly scrape and source their base information from copyrighted texts, including those with the United States copyright office, as well as those that are in the public domain, and have clearly been written by other sources. Any attempt to pass this off as original copyright-able material is clearly a violation of the original authors rights to their own work, the original intention of that work, and shows that it is just a way to disenfranchise authors and original creative works. In short, it is clear plagiarism, and any thing other than the United States copyright office declaring it is, so would it be a violation of what the copyright office stands for.
