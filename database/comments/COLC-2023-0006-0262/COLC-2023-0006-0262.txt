I am a fiction writer, specializing in books for children with disabilities. The AI model threatens to utterly destroy my industry in exchange for ill-gotten gains. Naturally, training an AI to replicate my writing style is an infringement of my work, just as stealing my voice to make a fraudulent audiobook &quot;read by the author&quot; would be. I believe all books for children created with AI should be marked as such explicitly and in plain text. I believe they should all be public domain. I believe AI tools should be forbidden from training on works not in the public domain. This is for the good of the reader, their parents, and finally all authors.
