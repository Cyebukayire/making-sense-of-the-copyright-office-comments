AI is harmful to the world when unregulated. Art, music, even voices are being stolen and used against people&#39;s wills. There are books about foraging mushrooms and plants being made with AI causing bodily harm to people. Doctors and lawyers are graduating college with AI, meaning they&#39;re not studying, causing more harm to the world. People are using unregulated software for everything and it needs to be regulated or demolished. AI is replacing hundreds of thousands of workers and damaging the economy as our services are no longer being needed, meaning there&#39;s less commerce being exchanged. AI NEEDS to be regulated.
