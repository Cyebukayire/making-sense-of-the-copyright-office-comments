AI models, such as chat GPT, utilize the database of the WWW to parse information in order to generate content. Much of that content is copyrighted material where the creators do not see any monetary compensation for. Currently, as you are aware, the WGA and SAG/AFTRA are on strike to ensure that AI is limited or non invasive (at best) in the creative process. Studios have even suggested that people sign over their voices and likenesses in order for studios to use those voices and likenesses in perpetuity. If AI remains unfettered, prior copyright guidelines will be found moot. As AI improves and usage expands it is imperative for Congress to look at it&#39;s current uses and anticipate future use to protect content creators as well as the IP of actors.
