&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; - which is not intelligent, it is just trained to steal from artwork online - has no business being copyrighted.  The nature of what copyright is revolves around having human beings create more art and should never be given to machines, or companies who use this kind of technology to commit art theft, copyright infringement, and mayhem in the art world.
