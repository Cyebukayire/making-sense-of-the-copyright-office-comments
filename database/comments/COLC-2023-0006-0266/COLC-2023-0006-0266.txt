AI, at it&#39;s core, must steal content made by people in order to function. It does not create, it stitches together the art, whether visual or written, of creative people who have not consented into an inhuman amalgamation. Content made by an AI content should not be allowed to be copyrighted, and it should not be allowed to steal others&#39; work.
