Works under copyright should absolutely be protected from AI training data unless the creator agrees and is fairly compensated. It is difficult for creatives to be paid appropriately for their products already and using it as training data without consent is theft. Protecting copyrights and establishing regulations that protect artists are critical for the creativity of the future. The less that creatives are paid, the less creativity we will have in the future as people turn away from the arts in order to be able to afford living in this world.
