I&#39;ve been a freelance media creator (writing, design, motion graphics) for over a decade, and I don&#39;t think AI created (or &quot;assisted&quot;) works should be copyrightable. As most AI is basically just databases assembled via web-scraping and theft, any work it creates is a work of theft. Maybe some human creators wish to opt in to their work being used for AI creations, but the vast majority of them weren&#39;t given a choice in the matter. Machine learning at its core can prove extremely helpful when it comes to other fields (especially in the sciences), but should be kept away from art and artists.
