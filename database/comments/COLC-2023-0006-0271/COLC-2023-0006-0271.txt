Generative AI  is no different than a writer using a source or an artist relying on another&#39;s work inspiration for their art.  Our creative process is informed by and shaped by the art we see, the media we consume, and the memories those experiences create.  We process those inputs and synthesise new creations.  <br/>That same creative product, art or text that is available to the public view, used to inform the products synthesized by an AI should be treated in the same manner.  Just as a fine artist or a writer learns their art, these systems - built and guided by their creators/instructors - are trained until they create what their instructors see.
