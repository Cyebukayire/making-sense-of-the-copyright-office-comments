Screenwriter here. Also someone who enjoys making AI art. My belief is. It should not be copyrightable. If not for everyone who has up to this point worked hard at their craft. It should just be stuff we can use for point of reference/knowing it isn&rsquo;t truly ours. On top of the fact how will you ever know. If it isn&rsquo;t stealing? Think of an AI made script or book. Any writer rushing like that. May not even research it. What is inside it. Then you realize this AI literature/script/novel. Has entire bits of star wars or something in it. Word for word but some random person notices. AI is too stupid overall. I&rsquo;ve had to correct chat gpt that one number was greater than another. This is gonna just be madness if you allow this to stand with real writer work. Same goes for the art really.
