AI is a threat to people and needs to be either severely regulated or cut off fully. The fact that it can be used to replicate people&#39;s voices and faces is terrible and literally something out of a dystopian novel. It threatens to take<br/>thousands and thousands of jobs from people because it&#39;s easier and cheaper, which is horrible for people who want to pursue jobs they have a passion for. It needs to be stopped.
