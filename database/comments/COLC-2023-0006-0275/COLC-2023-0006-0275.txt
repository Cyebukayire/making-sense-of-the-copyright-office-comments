What we are calling &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is no intelligence at all - it&#39;s just machine learning. It operates by taking apart what is fed into it - elements of sentences or images - and recombining them in a predictable way according to its programming. As it functions right now, these programs are simply theft machines, plagiarizing every single thing they &quot;create&quot; - and the companies responsible for them intend to profit from this theft, deliberately destroying the careers of those they steal from. None of this should ever be legal in any way.
