See attached file(s)<br/>Copyright was made to protect authors and artists. It has since become a tool for mega corps to wield unimaginable power over creators. IP&rsquo;s are seized forcefully (disco elysium) and corporations use their power and funds to extend their privileges (micky mouse act) while denying it to people. Corporations are NOT people. Copyright, Trademarks, Intellectual Property, and all manner of such things protected by law should not apply to corporations or organizations, particularly those with a profit motive in mind. People should be free to create, reform, satirize, deface, or otherwise modify ideas as they wish. Corporations have no authority to stop this. Most certainly not to help a bottom line.
