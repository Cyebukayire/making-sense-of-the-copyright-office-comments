AI development that uses other people&#39;s art is in violation of copyright! Sure, it&#39;s available online - i can watch content streaming online, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can steal pieces of it and call it mine. AI chops up people&#39;s art and remixes it and that&#39;s not right. I wouldn&#39;t say that by posting something online I&#39;m consenting to have it stolen and used by someone else - especially someone that might turn around and try to copyright what it stole from me (because let&#39;s be real, we know that&#39;ll happen with AI). Plus AI is being used to replace artists and writers and more, and now we&#39;re supposed to train it for free? But even not considering that, if we&#39;re not signing something when we go online that says we agree that it&#39;s in the public domain forever, I don&#39;t think that AI should be allowed to just pick pieces of it for its own training.
