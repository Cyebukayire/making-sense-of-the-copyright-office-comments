Hello:<br/><br/>&quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; and &quot;machine learning&quot; as it stands takes a heavy human toll as it is not really machine-based; it depends on people all over the world, most of whom are shamefully abused and underpaid, and it&#39;s getting used as an excuse to put journalists like me out of work so that we cannot report on it. It is also polluting information sources as we speak and drowning out the creative efforts of the human beings it is stealing from. It is not an &quot;existential threat to the world&quot; the way its progenitors want you to think it is; however, it is smoke and mirrors from the same billionaires invested in destroying democracy (Peter Thiel and Elon Musk are involved with OpenAI, for example) and must be, at best, heavily regulated. Thank you very much for your time.
