However copyright laws need to be amended in light of changing technology, one thing needs to remain the same: only human-generated work should qualify for copyright protection. That has always been the standard and has been upheld in court cases stretching back years. Businesses may seek to change these rules, hoping to make a quick buck by gaining protection for work that requires no creative spark and no human effort. The point of copyright is to protect the rights of creators to their work, not to pay a content farm or a tech company money as a reward for avoiding human contributions. The Copyright Office must uphold the constitutional rights of creators, even when asked to void those rights by powerful and well-funded special interests looking to take humans out of the creative equation.
