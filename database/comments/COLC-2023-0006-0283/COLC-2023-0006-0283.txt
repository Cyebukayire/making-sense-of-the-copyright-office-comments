Kellee Stewart<br/><br/>I am writing this comment as an individual. I&rsquo;m a professional actor and writer whose livelihood is being threatened by AI. I&rsquo;ve sold many screenplays to multiple Hollywood studios, and along with thousands of other scripts, my work has likely been used to train AI. I do NOT believe that AI generated scripts should be copyrighted. The source material it uses to produce something new is still that of a human writers, too plentiful to count, that receive no protection or knowledge of how this technology uses our work. I also don&rsquo;t agree that an AI generated script, then revised by a human writer should be copyrighted. If AI is involved in writing and/or acting it should not be protected material. AI is not human. AI does not create scripts without the help and source material of thousands of unprotected humans. Therefore it should not gain the copyright protections that human beings fought for.
