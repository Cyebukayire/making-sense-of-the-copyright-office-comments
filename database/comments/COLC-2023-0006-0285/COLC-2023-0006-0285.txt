&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; should not be allowed access to art or other creative works still under copyright to &quot;learn&quot; to mimic the talents of humans. Why can&#39;t these programs be applied to things we *don&#39;t* want to do instead of trying to subvert the human creative process? Corporations are profiting from people&#39;s work and not compensating them in any way.
