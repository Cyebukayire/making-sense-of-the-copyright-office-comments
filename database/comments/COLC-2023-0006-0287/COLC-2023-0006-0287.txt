I largely feel that people are misunderstanding that this is neither AI nor AGI and a slew of data is stolen to power the software. Either as base data or as &quot;seed&quot; to generate on top of. As it is not artificial intelligence, it&#39;s effectively plagiarism software and it&#39;s already having an extremely destructive effect on all creative industries. At best the data sets should be purged, all generated material must be labeled as such up to and including watermarks for images and it should be illegal to scrape for data indiscriminately. <br/><br/>To quote Dr Timnit Gebru, the software is a stochastic parrot. It is not creating anything new, simply taking data and labor from humans and chewing it up. No consent was sought out for the data needed to power the software, by admittance of its creators, because it would involve asking too many people. <br/><br/>They have known from the start that this is not only a deeply unethical practice, it is theft.<br/><br/>Please consider data regulation.
