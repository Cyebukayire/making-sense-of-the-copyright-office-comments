Copyright exists for the express purpose of advancing the arts and sciences. Insofar as artificial intelligence does not meet this goal, it seems plain that it ought not to be eligible. While copyright doesn&#39;t have a bar for the quality of work, it does require that it be made by a human. Non-human animals are not eligible to hold copyright, so too should it hold that a non-animal intelligence would be ineligible.<br/><br/>Those who control and operate AI claim that their selection process and prompting process is itself an act of creation, but in fact it is not creating new works, but mixing up and &quot;sampling&quot; other works, often without the permission and consent of those artists or writers who are &quot;sampled.&quot;<br/><br/>Allowing AI to have standing with copyright protection runs the risk of diluting the protections that genuine artists ought to enjoy, as they find their work fodder for someone else&#39;s AI project, and possibly even risk the original style being mistaken for an infringement on the AI emulation.<br/><br/>Insofar as copyright exists to incentivize human effort and endeavor, to provide a limited protection in exchange for creation, AI does not deserve copyright, as it is neither human effort, nor is it creation.
