Creating stronger copyright laws to protect artists from ai will not work. copyright law only benefits corporations and has rarely ever helped independent artists. as you can see from Adobe&#39;s recent actions, they are currently trying to increase the power of copyright at the direct expense of the most dedicated users of their platform, who are mainly artists who sell their work to survive. this will not actually help any artists at all, and will only make it harder for us to work. Adobe doesn&#39;t care about stopping ai from &quot;stealing artists work&quot;. nor does any massive corporation. to actually protect artists, either there needs to be a new system that protects independent creators and artists and gives them just as much (if not more) power over their own art as any corporation, or ai needs to be regulated in a way that the data being trained on is given up freely and knowingly by the creators. making stronger copyright will hurt all artists.
