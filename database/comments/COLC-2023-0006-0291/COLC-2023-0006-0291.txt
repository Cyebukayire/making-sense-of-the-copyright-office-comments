Allowing AI too be copyrighted or too be validated as any form of intellectual property is dangerous; all of the public AI generating platforms we see today like Midjourney or Stable diffusion use public data without the consent of the creators or copyright holders, this includes independent creators and large companies. If AI is allowed to be copyrighted then this could result in various legal complications involving how difficult it is too dissect what parts of the AI&rsquo;s massive database did it steal information and ideas from for whichever specific project is being disputed. To put things plainly, AI steals Data, content, art, works of literature etc without consent too train itself and then create content and projects from that stolen Data with no new or original ideas and then attempts too pass of these projects as completely original ideas with no outside involvement.
