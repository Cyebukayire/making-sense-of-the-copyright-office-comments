Ai can be used to help in media production. But the product of a prompt  should not be claimed as &ldquo;art&rdquo; because that demerits the work of actual artists, animators, designers, writers, etc. it should also not be used to breach the privacy of others, and there cannot be anyway to get around the breaching of privacy. Ai should be a tool, but should not, and cannot attempt to replace real jobs, people, and should not breach privacy or have peoples public statements used to train with or without their knowledge.
