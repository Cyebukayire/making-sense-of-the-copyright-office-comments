I appreciate the opportunity to comment on machine-generated content creation.<br/><br/>From what I understand, the term &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. I recently came across the description &quot;applied statistics&quot; and prefer this descriptor.<br/><br/>It seems that machine-generated content emulates what a human creator does (learn from copyrighted materials as part of the creative process) and is able to produce content much faster.<br/><br/>As an artist, I have used other artists&#39; work as part of my learning process (many art programs refer to this as a &quot;Master Study&quot; where students emulate a famous artist down to the brush stroke). When you examine my artistic influences, you will identify their work reflected in my own, even though I produce original pieces.<br/><br/>I believe machine learning from copyrighted materials is a valid approach for statistical generators.<br/><br/>In regards to whether AI creations can be copyrighted: Since US copyright only covers human-authored works, there should be a clear measure of human involvement. As an artist who has used AI tools for iteration and brainstorming (often incorporating my own artwork), there should be a clear delineation of how much input was provided by a human artist (in both text and iterations) and how much the work was edited afterward. (I&#39;ve used tools for initial creation, followed by my own refinements and additions to finish a piece.)<br/><br/>The creation process should be transparent, showing the stages of input, iteration, and final completion. Deciding the acceptable range of human direction and iteration is complex, but crucial.<br/><br/>Regarding the third matter, if AI-produced content closely resembles copyrighted work and doesn&#39;t qualify as fair use, the onus should be on the user who instructed the AI. For instance, I can use Adobe tools like Photoshop to reproduce copyrighted work, but the liability for its usage rests with me, not Adobe.<br/><br/>Addressing the fourth concern about artists fearing AI mimicking their style or identity: This is a challenging area, especially when considering the mutual influence among artists. Determining when a &quot;style&quot; can be copyrighted is tricky. However, if an artist&#39;s name is explicitly used during the AI&#39;s training process, they should be entitled to royalties for every generated image using their name as a prompt. Conversely, any creation derived from an image using an artist&#39;s name at any stage in its creation should be ineligible for copyright. Creators could consider using descriptors based on time periods or other thematic attributes to generate particular aesthetics. For instance, &quot;A superhero painting in the style of Van Gogh&quot; should not qualify for copyright protection while &quot;Painting of a superhero in the style of a post-impressionist using bold colors combined with thick, textured brush strokes&quot; could potentially.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my input!
