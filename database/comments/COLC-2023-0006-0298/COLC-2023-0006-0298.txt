AI in it&#39;s current form is useful as a tool for artists with their OWN artwork or even assistance in projects for their current company, but very obviously due to AI utilizing inputs to generate an output it means that artists who produce at the cost of their actual hands and bodies and years upon years of study and skill will have their own art utilized for a system that will ultimately kill them.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that AI art itself should not be subject to copyright in any capacity, and that any AI generation should contain a full comprehensive list of where, when and whome created anything that is used to train it.<br/><br/>Any material that that is obviously or directly claimed to be reproduced, drawn, or replicated from an existing artistic work via AI, under no means falls under creative use. Any unique AI generation must be fully documented as such when submitted in any space, and a list of inputs must be required.<br/><br/>There already exist a plethora of circumstances in which people target specific artists and their aesthetics online for training their AI. Artists not just across the US but also across the world have been vocal about their complaints of their work being stolen and utilized in ways that should in no way be considered fair use.<br/><br/>Artists should own their art, voice actors should own their voice as a piece of themselves, and writers should own their works.<br/><br/>As a member of the USAF I already understand that my life as an artist is and will be filled with difficulties, there is no reason to once more take a real skill and degenerate it into a commodity that is STILL reliant on Painters, Digital Artists, and Photographers.
