I am concerned that without close observation (and examination of existing data sets) machine learning models will be able to mimic unique styles of written, visual, and audio performance to the point of harm to performers and deception of audiences.<br/><br/>Already machine-learning produced ebooks are available alongside authored books in the Amazon marketplace without clear labels to inform consumers about what they are purchasing. It does not seem unreasonable to assume that if unregulated this will soon be true of music, film, and visual art.<br/><br/>Mimicry is not art. Machine learning does not happen in a vacuum, it is taught on stolen and frequently copyrighted data. Creators have a right to opt out of their data being used to train machine learning models, especially when they might soon find themselves in competition with those models.<br/><br/>Copyright laws should absolutely be enforced against machine learning data going forward and retroactively.
