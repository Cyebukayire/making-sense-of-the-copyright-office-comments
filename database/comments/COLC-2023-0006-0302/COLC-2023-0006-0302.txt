The use of AI based on or pulling from data involving the likeness of an actor or intellectual property of any artist should be considered unlawful and the most extreme violation of copyright law. Parties attempting to garner an agreement to use likenesses or intellectual property from artists or actors should come with stringent contract format requirements. Any contract for use of AI in these situations should clearly state the intention, as well as providing a tabulated list of exactly how those likenesses or IPs will be used. Anything outside of use documented by contracts should be considered an extreme violation of copyright law. The use of AI to create art without explicit permission from owners of the sources it pulls from is nothing more than advanced plagiarism, and needs to be treated as such. The narrative that AI is a cheat code for creating art easily needs to be struck down, as it will have a severe impact on industry and individuals. Not to mention the uses outside of art, which gone unchecked could result in a new age of misinformation, the likes of which have never been seen before.
