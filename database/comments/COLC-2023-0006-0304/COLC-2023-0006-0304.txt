I am just starting out as a writer and artist, and I will be facing impossible competition from AI technology which can bypass the years of work and study that human creators must go through to produce creative works. This AI technology is only able to create images and written text that might entertain others because it has absorbed millions of works by human creators, unfairly and without compensation. Even though what it produces might be an alteration from the original works it consumed, it is not the same as fair use because it is inherently derivative. The works used to train the AI should be at the very least licensed; the AI could be used to replace the original works and degrade all value from the original works by means of flooding the market with imitations. It should also be up to the original creators whether or not their works are used in a training dataset, with informed consent. This technology could limit or destroy the livelihoods for new and established artists alike. It is not adding new and original creations to society, it is simply stealing and regurgitating and replacing what humans have done. Please consider regulations and limitations on this technology. Thank you.
