I believe the big question in approaching copyright without entirely new legislation is where it stands as autonomous vs as a human driven tool. I definitely agree with prior decisions that AI generated content should not have copyright as it would betray the purpose of copyright (to encourage human artistic creation). I do however believe there should be some talk about the granularity in regards to the human input of copyright. It is possible for AI to reproduce copyrighted works, though typically with concerted effort on the part of the user. There should be some questions of liability there, requiring providers to take measures to limit it&#39;s ability to reproduce copyrighted works and user responsibility if they&#39;re shown to make an effort to coerce the AI into reproducing copyrighted works.<br/>There is also the question of whether or not the training dataset and the resulting training file qualifies as fair use. Obviously any copyrighted content in the training dataset would require license to copy the dataset, but it&#39;s the question of whether or not the training file is sufficiently transformative (it brings serious question in the instances in which it is able to reproduce a work, even if inaccurately)
