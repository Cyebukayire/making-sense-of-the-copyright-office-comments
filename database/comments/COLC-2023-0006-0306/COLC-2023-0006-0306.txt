The development and use of AI in various creative spheres such as art and writing has shown that the developers of these projects are unconcerned with the ethics. Indeed, I think many users are similarly unconcerned. As a writer and a working creative person, I strongly urge the Library of Congress not to grant copyright status to works made through AI generation. These works are using the copyrighted material of who knows how many writers, artists and other creators to create digital golems. Someone commissioning an artist does not become an artist the moment they receive the purchased painting, even if the prompt was theirs. The only artist was the one who did the work. A person putting a prompt into an AI generator is not an artist or a writer, merely a commissioner. They hold no copyright, even if they decide to smudge up the art they ordered or edit some sentences.
