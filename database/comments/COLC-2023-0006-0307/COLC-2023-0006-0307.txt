AI is in clear violation of intellectual property and copyright laws. Any learning model created art should be impossible to copyright. Also, training AI on copyrighted material should be illegal as well, as it infringes on the rights holder. Any AI program or algorithm should be required to share data on what material was skimmed in order to create art. It should not be allowed to run rampant on anything posted to the internet.
