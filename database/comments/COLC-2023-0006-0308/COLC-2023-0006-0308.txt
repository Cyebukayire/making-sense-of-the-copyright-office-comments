Using AI for writing is not real writing. Real writing consists of a human being conjuring images in their mind and translating that to the page. All AI does is take the key words from real writing and use it to make a second-rate version of a writing sample. AI should never be used in regards to creative writing for several reasons but the main issue is that literature is human culture and AI will worsen that. Furthermore, AI will consistently make humans worse at writing, speaking, and will result in the devolution of the human species. It must be stopped now or else stories and culture will keep getting worse and so will basic language skills. The key words that AI uses belongs to the real, human writer. AI cannot rewrite anything better than it did the first time and since 99% of writing is rewriting, it cannot be classified as writing. Please, we must ensure that AI is halted forever in regards to creative writing.
