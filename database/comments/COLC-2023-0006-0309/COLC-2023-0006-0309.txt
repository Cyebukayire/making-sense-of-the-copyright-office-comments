AI infringes on Americans&rsquo; rights and intellectual property. People&rsquo;s personal information is harvested as is artists&rsquo; and writers&rsquo; work, and then used without their consent or compensation. It would be illegal for a company to steal physical materials which they then use to create their product; it ought to be illegal for companies to scrape data without the consent of the person who creates or publishes the information, artwork, or other intellectual property. Content creators must be paid for their work, particularly if it is then being used by a for-profit company. Additionally, the use of AI to create deepfakes represents a danger to the public as deepfakes could easily spread disinformation or be used by fraudsters and identity thieves to defraud people and organizations. AI ought to be regulated to ensure that the originators of the data or images are fairly compensated, and to ensure protections for the public.
