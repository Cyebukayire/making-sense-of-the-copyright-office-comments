Due to the nature off AI generated content, It is impossible for it to exist on its own merit from a copyright standpoint. AI generated works are harmful to those who do not have the knowledge or experience to properly distinguish between the generative method used from someone using their own anthropological capacity and one generated by machine learning from datasets consisting of works of the former (especially whether or not they have been used with express permission of the original creator). Individuals are currently capitalizing on this confusion for their own self gain and detriment of others. To disincentivize this, works created by generative AI models should not be copyrightable in any way, and should go strictly to public domain where it can be as freely used as it has been freely generated.
