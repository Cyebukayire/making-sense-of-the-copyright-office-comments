I&rsquo;ve been a professional television writer for over 15 years. I grew up poor in Pacoima, Ca. but I managed to create a life that&rsquo;s above middle class. But now my career seems to be in danger because of AI. Without regulation, AI seems poised to eliminate many jobs or suppress wages, including those in my field. The monopolization of Hollywood, due to vertical integration started with the elimination of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules and termination of the Paramount Decree. Every time these regulations are eliminated or weakened, those of us in the creative community suffer. As I write this, Hollywood writers and actors are on strike as a direct result. If AI is not strongly regulated, it would be just one more blow to the creative community. It will be used by studios and the corporate elites to further enrich themselves at the expense of their employees.
