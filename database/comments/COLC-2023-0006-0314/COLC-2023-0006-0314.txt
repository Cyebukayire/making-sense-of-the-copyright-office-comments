I feel that the only time ai-generated works can receive copyright is when the data it used contains materials solely owned by the one who used the A.I., or otherwise licensed their use. Such license/rights negotiations fit right into current systems for actors, musicians, and others. If such standards are violated, the violators must compensate those they infringed on. Multiple offenses should levy harsher penalties, so as to discourage the wealthy from simply paying to commit crimes.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this new technology is dangerous as it is being used irresponsibly to create works that become attributed to people who did not write/say them, or to non-existent &quot;expert&quot; authors who give the public false information, all so that people who type a few sentences into an ai generator can make a few bucks off an e-book on Amazon. In the vein of current technological trends, it is trying to &quot;move fast and break things&quot; before it is regulated in such a way as to saturate our society to a point where it cannot be removed.<br/><br/>You should not be able to create ai-works using likeness without explicit labels or disclaimers declaring it as such. Allowing such things to exist in the public sphere threatens our democracy, with the public unsure if what media they consume is real or made by an ai.<br/><br/>When it comes to liability, I believe it should fall on the one who produces and displays works and not those who develop the system. Trying to train such systems to avoid similarities would be nearly impossible, and there is already a burden of responsibility on creators to not infringe on existing copyrights.
