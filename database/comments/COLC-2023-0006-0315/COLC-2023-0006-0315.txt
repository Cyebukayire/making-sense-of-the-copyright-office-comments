Ladies and Gentlemen of the US Copyright Office,<br/>Thank you for the work you do for all of us, and for this opportunity to submit comments.<br/><br/>I am a filmmaker and author, and am very concerned about generative AI&rsquo;s (GAI) scraping of copyrighted material in order to function. I am concerned as a filmmaker, and also as the copyright holder of my own films and books. <br/><br/>I have been in the film business for 40 years, and as a filmmaker I am very disturbed at the current practice of GAI models ingesting 100 years of film and series in order to deliver spoonfuls of that copyrighted work on demand. This practice will not only destroy the structure of the film business by replacing large portions of our labor pipeline, but can only do so by using our own work against us. (This is part of the reason the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild are currently on strike against the studios and streamers.)<br/><br/>If this were a new tech that operated on its own, or ingested only the work of the user in order to deliver the results, we would not be sending you comments. But the GAI tech currently delivers ONLY if it has been fed our work. It is unable to produce results without stealing our work, much of it officially copyrighted. The absence of consent and compensation in this process is theft.<br/><br/>This GAI practice appears to many of us to be the largest copyright violation in the history of the United States. <br/><br/>I sincerely hope you can stop this practice of thievery so that our copyrights can continue to provide the innovation and investment for which the copyright office was established.<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention to this matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>Justine Bateman <br/>
