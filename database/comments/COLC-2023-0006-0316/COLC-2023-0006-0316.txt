Niceole Levy here, and I&#39;m a professional writer. The idea that any artist -- writer, actor, painter, songwriter, singer, etc -- should have to fear loss of rights to their own material because it&#39;s being used to train AI is disgusting. AI cannot create -- it regurgitates -- and it&#39;s using our material to do so. Worse, it&#39;s doing it with the goal of taking jobs from human beings. To imagine a world where AI reads the great works of Shakespeare and then tries to write a new Shakespeare play... it&#39;s just despicable. Nothing made by AI should be open to copyright because it&#39;s never created... it&#39;s a mishmosh of someone else&#39;s (many someone else&#39;s ideas) -- it&#39;s NOT art.
