AI-created content should not be copyrightable. Copyright laws have already been abused by corporations to make it difficult for individuals to create both original and derivative works. Allowing companies or individuals to copyright AI-created content would stifle human creativity and destroy the work of artists. AI has learned on human-created content, especially the written word. <br/><br/>I am an author, and it&rsquo;s likely that my work and my creation has been used to train AI. Allowing content to be copyrighted that was created by a machine that &ldquo;learned&rdquo; from human creativity is, I believe, a grave threat to human creativity. What are we without our art, and content copied by a machine and spat out for consumption to make a company a quick buck is incredibly dangerous. I believe the copyright office has a responsibility to disincentivize the creation of AI content by companies who want to displace humans so that they don&rsquo;t have to pay them or support human art.
