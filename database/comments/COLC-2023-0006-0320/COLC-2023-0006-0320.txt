I believe if AI is so intelligent why should it be mingling with copyrighted work that already exists? and if it&rsquo;s AI that means it&rsquo;s not truly created by someone so that shouldn&rsquo;t warrant a copyright qualification. AI is garbage and copyright attempts must be blocked on all platforms to protect writers, actors, and any other creators that have work that could be impacted by AI.
