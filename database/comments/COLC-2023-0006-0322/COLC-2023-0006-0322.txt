No content created by &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; should be copyrighted by a human, and legislation should be introduced and passed to prevent it. Given the current use of the technology, content created by these means is produced by stealing and replicating the work of creators who have not consented to this, and thus must not be profitable.<br/><br/>In addition, the use of this technology to falsify images and text portraying or purporting to be created by real people has the potential to do incredible damage. Most people lack the ability to immediately distinguish between a real photograph and one generated based on a prompt by AI. This could lead to increased credibility in dangerous misinformation, increasing its potency and affecting public perception and action around important global events. It&#39;s my opinion that this software should be heavily regulated or even outlawed due to its potential for abuse.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this seems to be the most recent example of a pattern: tech &quot;innovators&quot; develop an unethical means to generate profit, knowing that it will only last as long as it takes regulators to act against it. They develop these means specifically to work hard and fast, with no intention of creating positive change in the world (or even the market). In this case, these algorithmic platforms threaten the work of creatives in all fields, cutting labor costs for executives. So-called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is not meant to improve our society. It is meant to be the biggest, brightest flash in the pan of the 2020s, to hurt creative laborers, and inflate the bottom lines of those trying to take advantage of it.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking my comments.
