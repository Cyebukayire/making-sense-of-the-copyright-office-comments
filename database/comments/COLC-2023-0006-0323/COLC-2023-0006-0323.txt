Artificial Intelligence is already committing blatant copyright infringement on a massive scale. That is the core of its nature, and the core of this issue. It is immoral in its annexation of human creativity, and amoral in its regurgitation of it. It does not differentiate between subversive art and propaganda, and perhaps that is why certain politicians and monied businesspeople are so enamores with it&mdash; it can give the illusion of inspiration to the most contemptible and crude ideas.<br/><br/>Proponents of this technology say it &ldquo;democratizes&rdquo; creativity, as if the relocation of creative output away from creators and into the hands of tech moguls is a selfless endeavor made on behalf of the common citizen. Well, I am a common citizen, and even I can tell that these efforts represent the wealthy class, unsatisfied with the complete exploitation of our bodies and minds for their financial gain, as they seek to extract all they can from our hearts &mdash; the very things that make us who we are as human beings, and the one thing that money can&rsquo;t buy.<br/><br/>I urge you to support the strictest legal guardrails for the use of this technology, to support robust legal protections for those most impacted and displaced by it, and to remember the lessons of the past few decades, in which infotech companies have grown into massive and dangerous political forces that shape the world around their bottom line &mdash; at great human cost. Think of the role Facebook played in inciting and encouraging the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar. Think of how young men are purposefully fed radicalizing content on YouTube, up to and beyond driving them to commit acts of violent terror. These companies will allow anything to happen to people as long as they can capture and resell the public&rsquo;s attention, and they will do the same with A.I. They already are.
