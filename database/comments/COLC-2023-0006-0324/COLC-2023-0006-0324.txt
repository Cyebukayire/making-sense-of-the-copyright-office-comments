As we&#39;ve seen technology develop at faster and faster rates, it&#39;s become clear that the tech industry&#39;s approach is not to ask. &quot;should we develop this&quot;, rather &quot;let&#39;s develop this then force it into the market&quot;. There has been some success to that end, such as the rise of media streaming and smart phones, but we&#39;ve also seen it crash and burn, some times wiping out billions of dollars in the process (see cryptocurrency and NFTs). All of this is context to my opinion that AI very much falls into the same trap. Generally speaking, AI could very well be a great solution and tool for certain industries and jobs. But the rise of creative AI, in my opinion, does not fall into that category. Why? Because it is not actually addressing an issue that we face today as individuals, as society, or as a human race. Creativity is part of the human experience and has been for all of history. Song, dance, painting, storytelling - these are all hallmarks of our human history. We have never had an issue with creating our own entertainment and media. In fact, when given the resources, we&#39;ve seen time and time again that the portion of the population that embarks on creative endeavors rises, whether it&#39;s the mass distribution and access to cameras over time, or with computer programs that allow anyone to make music, or the rise of social media as a way for individuals to distribute their own art. In each of those examples, technology plays a role as a tool, but it is never the actual entity creating. So when I consider how we should approach AI, especially creative AI that can produce images, stories, or videos, I think we should be considerate of why it exists. It&#39;s not to make it easier for users who are already creating to create, it&#39;s for those who don&#39;t create at all to skip the effort of learning a craft, and instead just yield a product that could potentially make money. And while that isn&#39;t inherently bad, the fact of the matter is AI has to learn from somewhere, and it is currently doing so from creators who have taken the time to learn and master a given craft. So not only does creative AI not solve an actual problem, but it&#39;s sole purpose of being a money making machine relies on stealing intellectual property. Therefore, personally, I believe products yielded from Creative AI should not be applicable for copyright protection, and I&#39;d even go a step further to say that the companies making these AI&#39;s should be forced to license every single bit of creative material they are using to train their software. If the tech industry really believes Creative AIs are the future and critical to innovation, make them put their money where their mouth is. Otherwise we have to recognize it for what it is: a grift.
