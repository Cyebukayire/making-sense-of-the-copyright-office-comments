A nuanced approach should be taken to artificially generated content. It can and will continue to be used for projects that have a significant investiture of human time and creativity, but it can also create works without almost any human involvement.<br/><br/>In general, I am in favor of not extending many protections to work that uses a lot of algorithmically generated material.
