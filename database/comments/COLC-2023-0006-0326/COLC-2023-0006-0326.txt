As no permission to use (sampled or entire) copyrighted works was obtained by the majority of companies making training datasets for all these generative algorithimic models, their current function is essentially poisoned and unavoidably plagiarism. Currently the most common use cases for these programs are intentional plagiarism, fraud, and other forms of criminal activity.<br/><br/>Regulation of the training datasets as well as the use of the generative &quot;AI&quot; must occur before such computer generated content can be considered for copyright.
