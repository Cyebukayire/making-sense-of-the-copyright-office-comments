As an artist, AI art has completely impacted my industry in a mostly negative way. With the endless AI art generators out there, people are able to use them to create &quot;art&quot; by inputting text prompts, including asking the AI to mimic a specific artist and pull directly from their works. This has resulted in people creating &quot;art&quot; that is NOT ORIGINAL in any way. The final piece uses previously created artworks by OTHER artists, which means that the person who created the final image using AI did not contribute any of their own actual artwork. <br/>AI has made it extremely simple for people who aren&#39;t even artists to rip off other hardworking individuals by using their own original artworks. I personally have already seen content creators online using AI generated art for their album covers, video footage, and even on packaging for products. There needs to be copyright laws in place to help the artists who create pieces that are being used and exploited by AI art generators. It is completely absurd and wrong for people to steal original artworks and ideas from other artists who actually put in the hard work for their pieces. Too many artists and creators are being negatively affected by this and it is causing a mess for our industry as a whole. Please put copyright laws into place for AI.
