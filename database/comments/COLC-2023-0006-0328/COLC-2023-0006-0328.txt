First, a distinction needs to be made between AI and Large Language Models. Any actual Artificial Intelligence would have to be self aware and capable of original thought. No such program has ever been written, and may never be. A Large Language Model is simply a tool that scrapes data and makes predictions based on trends. LLMs are not creative, and any product that is derived from that should not be eligible for copyright. Further, any works scraped as feedstock for the LLM should still be accorded full protection from infringement.
