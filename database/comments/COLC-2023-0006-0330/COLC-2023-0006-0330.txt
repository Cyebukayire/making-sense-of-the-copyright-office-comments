Artificial intelligence is not inherently something that should be feared or was made with the intention of harming others. However, the allowance of AI to &ldquo;create&rdquo; art by way of being fed hundreds of photos that living breathing humans have made on their own with their own skills, technology, and craft, the AI is creating nothing new, and is instead phantasmagorically fusing images together without respect to craftsmanship, artistic integrity, or skill. It cannot make anything without first being fed, and those who are willing to bypass the natural process of learning and skill and application of artistic methods (be it paint, photography, digital art, pencil, etc.)  should be at the mercy of all copyrighted and intellectual property law available to the artists that they stole from. If you find my image and want to use it to create your image as a reference, I&rsquo;m ok with that. In fact, I welcome it, as I believe that copying is the best way to learn something. But scanning my art, feeding it to a machine, and typing in key words to spit out a Frankenstein-ed bastardization of my craft, and then decide to sell it or claim it as your own, I would expect that my country, that I paid to go to school for and through, would have my back and protect both my artwork and myself.
