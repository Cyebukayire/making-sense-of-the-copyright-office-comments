The free use and trade of AI imagery is doing active harm to stock photography libraries. As someone in the business of finding reliable and high quality licensed imagery, I purchase licenses to stock libraries, which has now been overwhelmingly inundated with AI art. This imagery is therefore not only the aggregate of other copyrighted imagery, through stock sources like Adobe Stock it is being sold for profit. The images themselves are of lesser quality, and often have visual discrepencies that make them unusable. Something that is both in essence stealing copyrighted material and gaining a profit should be considered piracy, yet it is happening on mainstream services.
