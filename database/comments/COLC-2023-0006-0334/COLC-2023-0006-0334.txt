I work as a freelance artist and believe I have some insight into this situation. I have spent hundreds, perhaps thousands of hours of my life honing my craft, and I&#39;ve seen the damage that these tools can do firsthand - with no regulation in place artists are having their art scraped from the internet and fed into machines that spit out a mimicry of everything put into their work. Prompts often go so far as to include the artist&#39;s name when copying a style!<br/><br/>This might sound enticing - cheap art done fast for no effort - but consider the long-term effects of this decision: these artificial intelligences are trained on the work of humans. If laws are passed protecting the use of AI commercially it will inevitably put real artists out of jobs, and if there&#39;s nobody left to train on but other AIs, the world of art will enter a period of complete stagnation, AI training on AI-created images. Regurgitations of regurgitations on and on forever.<br/><br/>This decision is a tipping point where you can decide to stave off a looming dystopia. A future where nothing is human-made and everything you see is decided upon by an algorithm. Where the art is appealing, but lifeless.<br/><br/>Do you want the things in your life to have meaning to them? Or is it enough that they&#39;re pretty?
