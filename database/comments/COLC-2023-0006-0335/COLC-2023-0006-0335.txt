As a freelance artist of 11 years, I feel like I have a lot of knowledge on the subject matter regarding AI artwork. <br/><br/>AI is designed to imitate existing works created by other artists who&#39;ve honed their craft for years. AI doesn&#39;t create anything new or unique - it only copies from other people (most of the time where permission was never even given to them from said people to allow AI to use their artwork as a template to copy them in the first place). It is imperative that if AI becomes a norm in the industry, there must be a rule that states that the original artist is aware and okay with AI using their art as a template before AI makes any type of products from their work. Furthermore, the AI must credit the original artist that it templated off of, similar to that of someone writing a thesis who credits scholarly sources after quoting them, because if they chose to copy something from said scholarly source without crediting them, that&#39;s textbook plagiarism.
