Artist, writers, and more need to be protected from AI and what it came steal. Our methods, our brush strokes, everything an AI can steal is a part of who we are. As Individuals our signature is protected, correct. Our brush strokes and our voices whether written or spoken need to protected because they are just as individual as a signature. An artist&#39;s style needs to remain their own. No AI should be allowed to copy style. Whether it&#39;s Bugs Bunny, Snow White, or a teenager who is still discovering their voice through written works or arts. People first. Machines second. Here is where artists of all kinds are taken advantage of. For the love of something stop allowing us to be taken advantage of by AI or Disney or whoever next. Copyright people for once put the people first.
