An uncountable number of copyrighted works have been submitted to the learning datasets of various AIs, and the people who created and/or own those works--writing, art, photography, news articles, social media posts, books, music--were not contacted regarding this use, received no compensation for this use, and are unable to opt out from the continued use. Not only that, but incredibly personal information, such as likenesses and voices, have also been fed into these learning datasets without permission, also without permission, compensation, or the ability to have it removed. <br/><br/>This has an incredibly destabilizing effect on people who work in creative fields who fear their works will be used in this way, as well as everyday people who simply want to share a photograph of a sunset or a poem they wrote on social media who now fear that will also be &quot;scraped&quot; to be &quot;fed into&quot; these learning datasets.
