I do not support AI harvesting copyrighted material created by real artists simply because it is feeding off the creativity and foundations of those artists and creators that have taken a lifetime to develop their &quot;voice&quot; or &quot;vision&quot; in their chosen fields. To dismiss a persons devotion to developing their copyright protected work/vision/voice as only a &quot;style&quot; or &quot;technique&quot; so a computer can co-opt that voice or vision and use it for whatever reason is dangerous. I have already lost work to manipulated scans and copies of my artwork. It&#39;s hard to fight back in the marketplace when you are fighting against a computerized copy of your work offered to a client for less... that was looking for a piece in YOUR style!
