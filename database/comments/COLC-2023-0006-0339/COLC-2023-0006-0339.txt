As an author and screenwriter, I am terrified of the potential for my work to be used to train artificial intelligence systems. Copyright law in America has always put artists first and strengthening the language of any deals pertaining to A.I. is paramount to ensuring the copyright protections that my fellow artists and I rightfully deserve. Thank you.
