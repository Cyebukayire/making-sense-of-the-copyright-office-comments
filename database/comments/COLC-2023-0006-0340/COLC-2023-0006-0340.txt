The Gen AI models released to the public are a major threat to justice, safety and breaks rules of fair competition ( antitrust laws ). Gen AI models we have seen rise in popularity over the last year have already done unimaginable harm to individuals and companies around the world. Billions of copyright holders have been robbed of their work, their names, likeness and opus plagiarized and devalued. Billions of users of AI have been made an accomplice in this crime as well. This was possible because of the lack of punishment for breaking data privacy and copyright online and the hidden nature of software development. If this is let to run wild it will ruin even more lives both of those it exploits by taking data from them and those it exploits by making them users of said AI.<br/><br/>Is Gen AI a natural development of tech? No, it is not. Machine learning is nothing new, what is new is where it gathered its data from. The value of these models IS the data it collected. The machine learning behind these models is a form of sophisticated reverse engineering and if its not accompanied by consent, compensation and credit its also data laundering. There has to be transparency to what kind of data these models are trained on from the very first foundational models available. <br/>Automatic optout is A MUST in these matters since an individual will not have enough time in the day to stop all the automatic scraping going on and attacking his digital doors so to speak. There can be hundreds of potential scrapes popping up daily, is one seriously gonna have to monitor by themselves all of this attempted unethical scraping. It will be impossible and it is impossible to opt out of everything all at once. Furthermore, how can a child opt-out of these models when uploading online, how can a business who doesn&#39;t have unlimited resources to spend on clicking boxes on a form? Same as one wouldn&#39;t want malware on their company PC automatic opt-out is a common sense conclusion and bare minimum of safety.<br/><br/>What should we do with AI models and products of AI - delete them. We should not tolerate harmful software and products that are at best spam content and at worst extremely harmful to society. Just like one deletes malware that&#39;s how we should treat this software.  We should not encourage the construction of models that can harm, we should not legitimize their use by saying we can build on top of them. We should not give copyright to things made on top of nontransparent and unethical software.<br/><br/>Please protect children, individuals, artists, non artists and all businesses by reaffirming copyright, reaffirming safety online, reaffirming theft is wrong offline and online.<br/><br/>
