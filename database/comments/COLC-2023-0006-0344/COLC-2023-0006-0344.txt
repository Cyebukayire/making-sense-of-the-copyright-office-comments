I am very concerned about AI due to the fact that the output it produces is based on millions of individual&#39;s own work. AI is not &quot;intelligent&quot; despite its title. It cannot think of something brand new, the way human brains can. If it cannot create, if it cannot actually think, then it cannot have the same rights as thinking, creative human beings. AI threatens artists&#39; livelihoods, making it easier for companies to save on labor but producing worse results. It isn&#39;t just that the results are worse, of course. It&#39;s that those results were scraped from the minds and pens of millions of people. AI cannot create anything new; therefore, it should not have the personhood needed to copyright.
