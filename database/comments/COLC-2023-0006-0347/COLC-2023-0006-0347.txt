As a working professional artist, where my entire income rests upon my artwork, I feel like it is not okay for generative ai companies to be disguising themselves as nonprofit and data laundering my artwork for their profit. I would never opt in to companies like this even if I were to be compensated fairly. I do not want my artwork to be trained for Ai. I do not want any of my personal information to be training any sort of data set. My job is literally be replaced right now as we speak because everyone is &quot;having fun&quot; at the expense of my livelihood. Please do not continue letting this companies slide.
