AI &#39;creative&#39; works, art writing, &#39;photography &#39; film making, performing of any kind should not only never be allowed to be copywritten it should be prohibited to from being sold for profit.  It should be considered the same way any fanfic of a copyright character is. Not necessarily forbidden from be created for parody  or personal use but not allowed to be sold commercial. It is by definition plagiarism, stealing the creative work of others, most of which was gathered without permission and with no trail or record of where it was being sourced from. It is straight up intellectual theft and should be treated as such. Individual creators are not less entitled to protection from large companies using their work without permission than the large corporations are when protecting their intellectual property.  Mickey Mouse does not have more rights than my characters.
