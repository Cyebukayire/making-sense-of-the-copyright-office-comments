Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can only create content after being fed other content created by other creators. More often than not, in order to create a large enough data set for the desired product, this required AI programmers to feed the AI content that is created by other artists without their permission, which is a direct violation of copyright infringement for those whose art is supplied as part of a dataset for the AI. <br/><br/>Additionally, AI is not a living person to whom copyright protections could be applicable. Copyright is meant to help incentivize innovation, but AI cannot be incentivized, as it is not a living person. <br/><br/>The best comparison that an be made is to that of an orchestra. Composers are the true creators of the music. Their work is then given to musicians who perform what has been given to them under the direction of a conductor. The musicians and conductors are not the originators of the music they are performing, the musicians are merely performing based off of something they have been given, and the conductor is directing them to perform it. <br/><br/>An AI is merely creating something based off of another product it has been given, under the direction of its programmer. But the AI nor the programmer are the originators of the resulting product. <br/><br/>Artists, voice actors, musicians, and creators of all kind reserve to have their rights protected. Too often already, persons online are using ChatGPT and similar products to mimic the voices of public figures and voice actors, without their permission, thereby depriving voice actors of commission work. Artists are losing out on commission work because clients are feeding their works, without permission, into AI to create a product that they desire. It runs directly counter to innovation to have an AI produce all the work that a human otherwise should do.
