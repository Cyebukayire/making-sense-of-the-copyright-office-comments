AI is a non-sentient technological tool used to complete a task. A non-sentient tool cannot own the work product that it helps create. For example, a pencil cannot claim copyright ownership of the house plans the architect uses to draw them, nor can the pencil manufacturer. Neither a paintbrush nor its manufacturer can claim copyright ownership of a painting, even though both have contributed in some way to its completion.<br/><br/>Throughout history, great artists have used proteges and assistants to help them with tasks to complete their works. The artists direct the work of their proteges by defining the parameters of their task, and the expected output. Those assistants then work autonomously to complete the task. When the output fails to meet the requirements, the artist may then request further refinements and/or iterations. Even though these assistants are sentient, the supervising artist who directs the finished work retains copyright of it.<br/><br/>Generative AI is not sentient and does not create original content all by itself. It does so by request, based on parameters and expected output defined by the requesting entity&mdash;the user&mdash;who then asks for further iterations of refinement when the output fails to meet the requirements of the task. Therefore, Generative AI can be thought of as directly analogous to an assistant that helps an artist create art.<br/><br/>Often, employers stipulate as a condition of employment that employees forfeit any copyright claims for work products they create on on company time&mdash;regardless of whether the work product was requested or falls within defined parameters&mdash;and those work products, including intellectual property, belong to the company. Generative AI can also be viewed as analogous to a company employee creating a work product.<br/><br/>Similarly, composers hire session musicians to perform a piece of music. Sometimes the performers are directed to improvise original material within parameters defined by the composer, who may then ask for further refinements via iterations, or &quot;takes.&quot; These session musicians generally contractually agree on a flat fee for their services, forfeiting copyright claims or royalties from sales of the the final master recording.<br/><br/>It is possible that providers of AI services could stipulate that the work products created by their AI tools would belong to the AI service provider in an end-user license agreement (EULA) where the user agrees to forfeit any copyright claims over content generated by its AI. However, market forces would likely select against any service that imposes this kind of EULA because it would deprive the user of desired income from the content in favor of service providers that allow end users to retain copyright of the work.<br/><br/>Therefore, even if AI develops self-aware sentience, and absent superseding agreements where the user forfeits copyright claims to the AI service provider, the copyright for the work arguably belongs to the individual requesting the content, as opposed to the AI itself, the programmers who created the AI algorithms, or the service provider managing the AI portal.
