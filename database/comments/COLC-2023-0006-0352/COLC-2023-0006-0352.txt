As an artist, AI scares me with regards to the future of both labor and creativity. There is potential for such technology to radically alter the landscape of all digital content, while completely disregarding laws like intellectual property and especially harms individuals.

On top of being widely utilized, this early state of such technology gives the impression that content and media made with it will be effectively &quot;soulless&quot; and not show passion that is inherent and important to such content and media.
