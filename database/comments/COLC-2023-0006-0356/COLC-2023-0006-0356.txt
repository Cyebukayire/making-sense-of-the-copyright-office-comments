It&#39;s fairly simple... The AI knowledge base is created through input by all of us.  Putting in parameters is basically using it as a search engine and what it delivers is a conglomeration of all of our thoughts, hopes, dreams, fears and anxieties. If you copyright AI generated material you will basically need to copyright Internet searches which seems strange. <br/><br/>Alternatively you could copyright it and then give anyone who has ever knowingly or unknowingly contributed to a large language model a residual.<br/><br/>At their best, LLM AI is a synthesis of all humans who have contributed. It&#39;s something that is shared by us all.
