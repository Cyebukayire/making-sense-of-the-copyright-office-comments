Artificial intelligence is a misleading name, these programs algorithmically &quot;learn&quot; a pattern of images, and then reproduce them. in terms of copyright the issue should be unambiguous, they are incapable of any sort of creation of new original work that is not fundamentally based on algorithmic reproductions of someone elses copyrighted material. even if a human if giving the algorithm prompts of some kind they only tell the machine what specific parts of other peoples work to reproduce. if the algorithm is working without prompts it is simply randomly choosing what stolen art to recreate. If i copy and pasted sections from a newspaper into a new pattern of the exact same sentences and then sold it as an original newspaper, there would be no question that i had stolen information from articles someone else had written.
