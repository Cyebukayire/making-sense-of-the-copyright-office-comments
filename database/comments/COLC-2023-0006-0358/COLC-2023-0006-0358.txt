I do not believe broadening copyright laws and enforcing them aggressively will be an effective solution for protecting artists from copyright. Our existing copyright system has already done more for corporations than independent artists, and ideas like extending copyright to cover art styles would give media companies like Disney or Viacom and tech companies like Adobe even more power over artist just trying to make a living. They don&#39;t actually care about protecting artists from AI. The only thing they want to protect is their bottom line.<br/><br/>In order to actually help independent artists, either a new system must be put in place, one which prioritizes independent artists and gives them at least as much power over their work as corporations, or AI needs to be specifically targeted by regulation - either by requiring that all data used was given freely and knowingly by the creators, or by classifying AI-generated works as derivative works of all works included in their data set, and requiring the disclosure of said data set.
