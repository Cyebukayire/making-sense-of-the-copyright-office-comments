AI is a tool that&rsquo;s pointed on both ends. If abused, by billionaires who run movie and tv studios but root for those who make their movies and TV to go homeless instead of lay them a living wage, then human art will become obsolete. Worse, non-existent. We are creeping into the opening titles montage of a real life TERMINATOR movie, only instead of traveling back in time to fix our mistakes - we have to make the repairs in the present to save us from our own broken future. AI borrows and steals and cultivates art created by humans to pulp out a facsimile of said art, created by a machine made by the very people it copies from. That&rsquo;s not art, that&rsquo;s not creative. That&rsquo;s programming. To protect jobs in the service of art, especially in movies and tv, we need to protect ourselves from the temptations that the shortcuts of AI provides and put our energy and resources and money into the artist. Regulate the hell out of AI. The Terminator films aren&rsquo;t cautionary tales, but they will become just that if we don&rsquo;t guardrail the hell of the artificial intelligences eager to replace the real thing.
