Generative AI should not be subject to copyright. The purpose of copyright is for an author to be able to continue to make a living off of their work. That is its only reason to exist. Generative AI is about corporations cutting authors out of the process and extracting money for themselves while supporting no one. One of the few ways they will be disincentivized to do this is if they cannot copyright the things the chatbots create. They want creations for free that they can then charge others for while maintaining ownership. That&#39;s all the pieces of the pie. Denied exclusive ownership, they are denied the &quot;value&quot; they hope to extract while refusing to give art and artists their due. <br/><br/>Copyright is not for corporate profits. Copyright is for artists and their families to support the continuation of the arts and should therefore be limited to creations by humans.
