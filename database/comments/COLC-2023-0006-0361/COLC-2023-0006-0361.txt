Especially as the way current &quot;AI&quot; works, I would say that any works produced by AI and other general learning model algorithms and processes should not be copyrightable. These machines take other people&#39;s work and regurgitate it in unpredictable but not wholly unique ways. The scraping of content in order to fuel these machines with enough data in order to produce somewhat useful function is key in that the authors of the works being used are often not consulted, paid, or attributed to the resulting works and AI/Learning machines effectively steal their content in order to function. There is no way to reliably detect or reverse engineer the results, so they cannot be trusted to disclose when they have or haven&#39;t used previously copy-written material without proper disclosure or compensation. Effectively, computers, like animals, cannot be granted copyright status over works, as they do not hold the capacity to understand their work or inspiration. The programmers (and companies) likewise cannot effectively attribute the results to their own datasets, so they should not own the results either. <br/><br/>Copyright protections are already too strong to the point where they are weaponized to hurt the public more than they are a benefit to society, it is time we start to work to not just prevent more of it in the future, but to reverse that effect.
