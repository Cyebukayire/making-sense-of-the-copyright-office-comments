Respectfully sirs in madams,<br/>This issue is about protection.  The United States of America stands at the front of protecting the rights and properties of individuals.   Is an AI an individual ?   This is easily answered because it is not.  People have creativity.   AI has regurgitated output from people input.  The old saying goes, garbage in garbage out.  If an AI is fed garbage it will regurgitate garbage.  If an AI is fed Brilliance than an AI reaches toward brilliance.  So did the brilliant warm-blooded individuals say - yeah sure the AI can have all my credit.  I think not.<br/>Thank you, Lonnie
