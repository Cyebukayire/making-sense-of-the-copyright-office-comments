In no way should a work wholly created by any form of AI be eligible for copyright.  LLMs and their visual-creation counterparts operate by taking work created by a human, possibly copywritten in its own right, and iterating.  This is not the same as what a human might do using other work as inspiration.  AI can&#39;t, in its current form, be inspired.  It is using prediction models to guess what the next logical word or pixel should look like.  Nothing created is new and novel.  It is derivative and likely violating copyright laws.<br/><br/>At some point some government body is going to have to decide if a work that started with AI generation and then is worked on by a human is eligible.  To what extent is that provable and what would the percentage of unique human work required be?  I would argue anything that is based on AI generated work is already infringing illegally on copywritten material based on the way these AI models are currently trained (a wide net that indiscriminately catches anything regardless of origin) regardless of how much it is changed.<br/><br/>Impersonation of another whether it be by AI generated voice, written word, or visual art should be made illegal.  Creating a work in the style of someone else for profit without any effort beyond typing a few key words into AI will lead to the end of newly human generated art and, eventually, the end of culture.  While that may be someone&#39;s idea of progress it sounds very much like the death of the human soul.  We are all in a place now to put logical and reasonable limits on these corporations that are trampling over the humanities in the pursuit of &quot;progress&quot; and easy money.
