Machine generated content like that by AI should remain unable to have a copyright unless significantly changed into a new work by a human and it is significantly different from other artists. There should be stronger copyright laws to allow small artists to protect themselves from corporate theft and digital sampling while still leaving them a venue for sharing online. Online copyright in general should be classified and tightened to protect small artists and developers. Which also should really focus on ai generation and content id, to also prevent misuse of copyright by bad actors and companies out to falsely claim a right to other people&#39;s content in websites and programs to make money
