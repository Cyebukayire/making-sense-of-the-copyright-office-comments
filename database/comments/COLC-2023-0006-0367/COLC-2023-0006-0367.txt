Artificial intelligence cannot be allowed to replace artists and writers. It would leave hundreds if not thousands out of work, and it has already been ruled that a work has to be created by a human to be copyrighted. If companies are allowed to copyright AI scripts, comics, paintings, and novels then they will not bother with humans.
