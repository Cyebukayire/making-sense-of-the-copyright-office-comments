Regarding questions about the appearance of &quot;scraped&quot; works in AI-generated outputs and imitations of style presented in AI-generated proceeds, I believe there is a simple resolution: the firm or person who owns the AI machine or algorithm is not liable, but the person who uses such proceeds is liable for infringement.<br/><br/>Simply put, &quot;scraping&quot; is training. While the student at issue is a machine, it is no different than the art student who goes to the local art museum and sketches the works of Monet or Picasso in their notebooks. Nobody would ever suggest that their copying is anything other than a fair use, and nobody would ever suggest that the sketch they generate is anything other than a copy. However, the statute protects this conduct. But only up to a point. The moment that same art student publishes their sketch or sells it to a magazine, or publishes it to a website, that student&#39;s conduct ceases to be a fair use and becomes infringing copying and using.<br/><br/>In the same way, machine &quot;scraping&quot; (for inputs) and &quot;sketching&quot; (for outputs) is no less a fair use than the human art student. Similarly, if any person were to use what that machine generates, i.e. the AI-generated proceeds, and those proceeds incorporate infringing uses of another person&#39;s art, then the person who uses those proceeds is engaged in infringement. Thus, while it would not be infringing for an AI application to produce proceeds incorporating direct copies of another person&#39;s work, so long as there is no economic activity related to the generation (including selling advertising through the AI application or requiring a &quot;prompter&quot; to watch an advertisement before being able to view such proceeds), then the AI company remains in a strict fair use safe harbor. But the minute that AI firm steps outside the bounds of generating proceeds and into any realm that constitutes exploitation of such proceeds, it steps out of the safe harbor and becomes an infringer. Similarly, the &quot;prompter&quot; who copies and pastes those proceeds to their Instagram account, to Facebook, or makes prints and sells it, becomes an infringer. At which point, whether the &quot;prompter&#39;s&quot; conduct beyond creating an AI input prompt constitutes actionable conduct (i.e. more than a technical, de minimis infringement) ought to be a fact issue within the purview of the courts - not the Copyright Office.
