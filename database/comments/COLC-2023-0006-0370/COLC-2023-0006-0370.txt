As an artist and a writer, AI generated content should NOT be granted copyrightable status. If the purpose of copyright is to stimulate creative works within the cultural landscape, AI does not do so. AI does not innovate, it may squish together ideas in interesting ways, but it does not innovate.<br/><br/>An AI image generator would never have created the impressionist movement, or the surrealist movement or abstract expressionism. It takes a human mind with all of its messy madness to break out of bonds and create a new idea.<br/><br/>AI text generator would never have created the cut-up movement or the post-modern novel or even the general structure of pulp that guides vast amounts of literature today.<br/><br/>An AI music generator would never have created jazz on its own. It might be able to generate new jazz forms but nothing will break out into whatever the next world changing creative paradigm is.<br/><br/>If you hand the reins over to AI and incentive its generation of infinite amounts of pink goo, you dilute the few beautiful and talented voices that are creating our next momvements in art, music and literature.<br/><br/>AI is a toy that borrows human creativity and re-hashes it into something else. It can only move all art and literature towards a boring center if allowed to proliferate wildly. Acknowledging AI generated content as creative work will stop all innovation in art in its tracks.
