I cannot claim to be an expert. However, I have been fairly involved in discussions surrounding this topic and have tried to keep myself informed. As such, I have identified a few key points that I believe absolutely must be taken into account regarding any regulation.<br/><br/>1. There is a great deal of misinformation floating about regarding AI/Machine Learning. For example, there is a persistant belief that these technologies make a &quot;collage&quot; of stolen works. This is not the case, and the technologies involved do not store or even have access to the training materials in their model once training has been completed. I hope those involved in making these decisions will take their information from experts in the field who know and understand how the technology works while discarding misinformation.<br/><br/>2. Future-proofing. There was recently news about a ruling that copyright requires &quot;human&quot; input. While, presently, Machine Learning contains no true intelligence, I believe the wording of any regulation should find other ways to qualify or disqualify a work. There is the possibility in the future that true AI, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could be created, and the potential for creative works produced by a non-human sapient being should absolutely be a accounted for. I would argue that a work created entirely by algorithm does not qualify, of course, but even otherwise untouched works still involved the detailed crafting of a prompt. Does a prompt - written by a human - run through an incredibly complex algorithm to produce an image or text qualify? That is a question which should take into account existing tools that do similar things currently in-use in many digital arts. Algorithms to make work easier are already common in the field.<br/><br/>3. Impact to artists. This would be one of the few counter-arguments that I would have to agree has some merit. Unfortunately, I would suggest: where would we be today if people regulated the invention of the industrial loom into the ground and prevented the Industrial Revolution because tailors who produced clothing by hand would be put out of business? It must be carefully weighed whether the benefits to society and the economy and the human race are greater if we stifle or encourage this fledgeling technology. In my personal calculus, we must absolutely encourage it. But I am not an expert, and experts should have their words outweigh mine.<br/><br/>Another common argument is that of &quot;ethics,&quot; and the common arguments are ones I vehemently oppose. A Machine Learning model learns patterns and how things are typically connected by studying existing art. It does not then keep the existing art. It is not available in any database or in any form to the model. It only keeps what it learned from the art. In this way, it is no different than a human art student using reference images or learning art by studying the art of other artists. There is nothing unethical about it. There is no theft involved. Any argument to the contrary would also call every human artist that ever learned from another artist or used a reference image to be in breach of copyright. I would urge those involved in these decisions to, again, listen to the experts on this technology and disregard the emotionally-charged arguments based on misinformation that commonly accompany any arguments about the &quot;ethics&quot; of this technology.<br/><br/>Machine Learning is in its infancy still. It has a long way to go. But it is my sincere and honest belief that this technology, if allowed to grow without undue restrictions placed by misguided fearmongering, will be one of the most revolutionary and beneficial technologies that humanity has ever produced. Already, the same underlying technology is being used to give speech back to stroke victims. It&#39;s being used to analyze data faster and more efficiently than ever before, leading to things like improved medications for the sick. And while those uses of this same technology are outside the purview of Copyright, unduly stifling the technology where copyright applies will also stifle the advancement and development of all forms of this new technology.<br/><br/>So my final hope is that those involved with this decision will look at how their decision will affect this technology and the people touched by it even outside of copyright itself, as these decisions being made will undoubtedly ripple far beyond copyright law.<br/><br/>In summation, I am not advocating for a total lack of regulation and consideration, but merely a light touch tempered by facts and a consideration of the larger issues at stake, rather than misinformation or fear-mongering or short-term gains.
