AI generated material should not be subject to copyright protection.<br/><br/>Copyright is designed to protect an authors interest. An AI can not not generate original work and thus is not an author. AI generated work is derivative of work processed into its model. Furthermore an AI can not have an ownership interest  in material it generates as it is not a person. Also as AI does not die there is no limit to the term of material any ai generates. <br/><br/>Conferring copyright protections on AI generated content will result in the collapse of countless creative industries and damage artists ability to be paid for their work, it is a dystopian idea.
