AI artwork and writing should not be allowed copyright. The process of creating something from AI is to utilize the hard work of actual humans that most often do not consent to the usage of works in the AI work. Even if there is consent the final product is still in the end created by a machine. The person who generated it by AI did not put in any of the work to do so. By not being the direct author of the work this would open up the copyrights of many fields and lead to many issues. Especially when AI work pulls from people whose work is copyrighted already without consent which happens often. AI if used should only be used for personal purposes, and as a result should not require a copyright. If used commercially then it&rsquo;s setting a precedent that the people whose work contributed to the generative AI do not deserve to be paid while the person with AI got paid. It is wrong and will lead to many Americans who creatively produce out of passion for their communities to lose their livelihoods by allowing it.
