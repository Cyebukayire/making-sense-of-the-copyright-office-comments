In the rapid realm of technological advances AI and generative AI are perhaps growing the fastest. In order to keep up with their growth I believe it is important for policymakers and others in charge of various things to keep up to date alongside such advances. However currently as it stands I think we&#39;re treading a fine line. I do not think AI created works should be copyrightable at this point in time. While some AI generated &quot;creations&quot; can be interesting their entire workflow relies on using creations created and copyrighted by real people. With so much copyrighted content being thrown into what&#39;s essentially a blender and spitting out a smoothie it seems irrational and unjust to potentially say that the individual drinking the smoothie would be the one who gets to decide they can sue others for making the same smoothie so to speak. While they may have chose the ingredients. all those ingredients were created by the work of many and often in the current AI wild west era are taken without permission. I personally believe if any copyright scenario is to be involved in generative AI works then it should be spread equally/weighed via contribution% among all the creators whose work was used to create the output (Every artist who&#39;s work was thrown into the blender, everyone involved in the creation of the AI, the individual writing the prompt assuming the AI isn&#39;t trained on stolen content.)
