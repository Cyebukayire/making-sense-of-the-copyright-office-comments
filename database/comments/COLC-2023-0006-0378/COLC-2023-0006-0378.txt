AI is everywhere. I am an avid Family Historian and sites like ancestry and Family Search have been using it for a while. It is not full proof and does get things wrong. Also with no sources cited you cannot really be sure where it&#39;s getting it&#39;s information, so you really cannot use things like Chat GPT in your work.<br/><br/>I am also a writer. AI is good for things like brainstorming but I would not use it beyond that because you didn&#39;t know where the information is coming from.<br/><br/>I tried Sudowrite and had issues. 10 to 100 dollars for limited words, that you can use up in less than 24 hours if you have no clue about how it works. You also don&#39;t know if it&#39;s coping a published author when you ask it to type something. Same with any of the AI software out there.<br/><br/>Also people are using AI to write books and publishing them, though it&#39;s hard to prove that AI was used.<br/>
