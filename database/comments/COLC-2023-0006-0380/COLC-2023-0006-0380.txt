I am highly against AI replacing artists and writers and actors. I think AI needs to be heavily regulated and it needs to be made clear that art is something that can only be created, and therefore copyrighted, by a human being. AI has no place replacing the human desire to make art. I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of uses where AI could be helpful, but stealing jobs is not one of them. It should make our jobs easier, not unemploy us all.
