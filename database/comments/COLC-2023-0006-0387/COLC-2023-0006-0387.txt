As a television writer and member of the Writers Guild of America, I am very alarmed and concerned about a future where A.I. generated works can be copyrighted. A.I. algorithms scrape data from existing copyright material that was created by humans, with human effort, and synthesize it into something new. In other words, they plagiarize human-written material. Therefore, works generated by A.I. should not be copyrightable. This must be codified by law, in perpetuity. And the writers of works used as input data for machine learning should receive royalties for helping train these systems. After all, downloading a book or movie and reproducing such works without proper permission and payment is a copyright offense. The A.I. companies will argue that what their algorithms do is no different than what a human writer might do -- consuming media and then incidentally or intentionally using it as inspiration for a new piece of material. But humans can only consume a fraction of what a machine can, and they cannot analyze it and reproduce it with exact precision. While a piece of media may form an impression on a writer and affect their own work going forward, they are not simply regurgitating or imitating that same work the way an A.I. algorithm would. These creative algorithms also allow companies that use them to undercut worker compensation or eliminate jobs that were once steady and lucrative. A.I. is simply being used by companies and individuals to cheat and plagiarize, and do little else. Technology should be used to solve problems in our world, not create more. Unfortunately the free market cannot stop this kind of harmful &quot;innovation.&quot; It is up to the government to put in guardrails that regulate against a future with people out of work while robots copy and paste those same people&#39;s past labor into perpetual profit gain for tech and media companies.
