Please regulate AI heavily and immediately. The work of a possibly uncountable number of writers and artists has already been exploited by AI companies without compensation. AI is also negatively affecting quality of life in three ways. One, by replacing humans in art and writing positions. Two, by sucking up resources that could go to human invention, and instead producing a slurry based on existing work of images and writing and stifling innovation. And finally by producing cut and paste articles and responses that are not necessarily accurate, could be misleading and could also be easily used to misinform.
