Hello, I am a composer and musician, and the usage of unregulated artificial intelligence in my field and other artistic fields concerns me. <br/><br/>With AI technology in fields of music, you can analyze an artist&#39;s compositions or even voice, to create a replica of their work or voice. With this trained program, you can then use their artistic likeness to make money, without the original artist ever consenting to this. Therefore, it is a copyright violation. <br/><br/>AI technology, when unregulated, robs artists of their means to make money with their own work. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
