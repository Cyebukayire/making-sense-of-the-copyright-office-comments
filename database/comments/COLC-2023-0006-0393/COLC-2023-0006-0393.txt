The idea that artificial intelligence can gobble up creators&rsquo; work and repurpose it, for profit, without paying the creators for the work that was fed into the model, or allowing them consent on the use of their work is obscene. This is not artistic influence, it is plagiarism and should be treated as such. No copyright should be granted to work created in this way. I am a published author, and the idea that by virtue of publishing my work, I have granted permission for it to be used in this way goes against everything we believe about copyright and fair use in this country. There is nothing fair about taking the work of human hands and minds, ventriloquizing it, and then claiming that it is original work. The chilling effect on creative work by this technology is incalculable. Why should anyone make or share anything if they know it will only be fed into the maw of this machine? If Mickey Mouse can be protected for a century, I should be able to expect that my work, my livelihood, will be protected for ten minutes from being strip mined in this way.
