I find the recent uses of AI distressing, as it steals work of artists in the process without credit or permission. If someone could have an AI taught on their work alone, or exclusively with their express permission, I think it would be fascinating, but as it is, it&rsquo;s horrifying and seems to be only getting worse. I heard conversationally that some are considering blocking AI from being copyrightable, and I genuinely think that is a choice for the better. As things are at the moment, &lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; programs are unethical at best.
