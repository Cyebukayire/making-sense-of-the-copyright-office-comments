AIs are trained using vast amounts of human works. They have rather accurate.y been described as &ldquo;plagiarism engines.&rdquo; Those works that they draw from are generally original and capable of being copyrighted. <br/><br/>The idea that someone could simply collect some sample of such fragments and &mdash; without any creative input &mdash; copyright the output seems fundamentally inconsistent with nature of copyright. <br/><br/>Further, it is contrary to the purpose of copyright, which has been to permit human beings to protect and benefit from the production and dissemination of their creative works. Here there is no human author, and so no need to copyright the output material and protect the rights and interests of the author, because there is in fact no actual author involved.<br/><br/>Worse still, we have already seen that AI-produced material is used to simulate the work of real, living, human authors, and that this AI product is then marketed as being by those human beings. This further deprives real authors of the benefit of their own work, and damages and devalues their reputations, since some people will assume that substandard even even grossly inaccurate (and even dangerous) works are the result of a human being. This damages real authors by redirecting value from creative authors, as well as putting their reputations and public standing at risk. That seems grossly opposed to the most basic justifications for copyright.<br/><br/>Copyright should not be extended to AI-produced material.
