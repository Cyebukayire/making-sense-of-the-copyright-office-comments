In short No. the reason: not created by a human and so you have questions of ownership. Is it the owner of the program? The licensee of the program or the actual user of the program who provided the input?  And how long will the copyright be? If it is a picture then is must a derivative work and so can it still be copyrighted? If it is a program code is it the code that was derived from that own the copyright?  So all this should require legislations and simply put NO will be the easy answer<br/><br/>
