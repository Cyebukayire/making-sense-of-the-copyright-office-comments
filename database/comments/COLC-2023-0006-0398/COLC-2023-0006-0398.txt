AI can be a useful tool, but it shouldn&#39;t be allowed to simply vacuum up all sorts of things that the person using it has no right to, only to spit something out afterwards and claim it as an &quot;original work&quot;. Works placed on a platform like Twitter/X, art sites, or hosting services shouldn&#39;t be free rein for AI to simply absorb and use artists&#39; work without compensation. And most of all, using AI to absorb the speech of given people shouldn&#39;t be used to simply create wholesale speech of that person, as that can become very dangerous when not even someone&#39;s spoken words are safe from being faked.
