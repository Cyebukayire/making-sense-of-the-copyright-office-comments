AI is being trained by copying and ingesting the work of artists and creatives without compensation. They are not only stealing original work to train their AI, which will supposedly be worth billions of dollars, but they want to use these &#39;generative AI&#39; programs to minimize labor costs and destroy the ability of these same artists to earn a living. <br/><br/>This is happening right now, and the government has done nothing to protect its citizens from these massive corporations and highly funded startups. Movies, music, and television are some of America&#39;s most valuable exports, economically and culturally. It has helped us assert our dominance. If the government of the United States does nothing to protect artists and exclusively listens to CEOs of tech companies and studios, you will be allowing them to decimate these industries, and over time they will lose the global dominance they once had.
