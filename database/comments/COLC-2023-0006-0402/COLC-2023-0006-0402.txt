Hi there!<br/><br/>I&#39;m Liara Roux, an author and indie porn performer. Both my writing and my pornography has been used to train AI; I know this because my name is listed in public data repositories. Obviously, this is horrifying. I think the use of my writing is of course unacceptable, but appropriation of images of my body is particularly disgusting. My art is very personal and to have images of my body used without my consent, often in the creation of violent and dehumanizing imagery, is completely unacceptable. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time :)
