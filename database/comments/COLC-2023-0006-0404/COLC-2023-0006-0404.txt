There are no circumstances under which works created by generative AI should be copyrighted unless permission is given for every single work that is used to train it (under the context of proper licensing). Anything else undermines tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of artists, authors, and others (both professional and amateur) to produce something worse than the sum of its parts. This would be a step to crush artistry as a means of livelihood, which will in turn degrade industries that produce mediocre content at the expense of both employees and consumers. It benefits nobody in the long run under any implementation, and will contribute to a vast dilution of culture to its blandest roots. <br/><br/>While not as acknowledged as military power, American cultural power remains one of its strongest assets on the international stage. Allowing GAI to subsume the creative sphere will wholly undermine this competitive advantage.
