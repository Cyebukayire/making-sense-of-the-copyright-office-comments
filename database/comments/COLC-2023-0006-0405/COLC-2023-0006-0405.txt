The inputs to the various generative AI engines appear to be very extensive and controls on accessing copyrighted material and material behind paywall blocks are lacking. Evidence of the former is substantiated by the filing of multiple copyright lawsuits currently in the court system. A defense that the generative AI is only inputting word sequences is not justified when the AI is able to generate output strongly correlated to the text of copyrighted material. If only word sequences were being recorded then the AI would not be able to output a detailed analysis of any given author&#39;s work; this would only be possible if the work in question had been in the ingested data.<br/><br/>One question to be considered is what are the author&#39;s rights when copyrighted materials are publicly available. Are the rights to analyze the the materials enhanced when the writings are published electronically but still protected by copyright? Does making the text more easily accessible modify the author&#39;s rights in any way?<br/><br/>As an IT professional, an author of peer-reviewed journal articles, and a contributor to various open-source projects and documentation efforts, I am concerned about how public, semi-public, and paywalled/private information is being ingested into the various generative AI engines. Ingestion of pure public, non-copyrighted text (if there is such a thing) should be openly allowed. Pulling in copyrighted materials without the authors consent is not acceptable even with the justifications that only word sequences are being analyzed.
