Trainers of AI(machine learning, neural networks, large language models and algorithmic systems) should be required to secure consent and licensing of the owners of the data that is used as a training set.  This should not be acquired via the small print in a EULA or other such agreement.  People who use publicly trained AI systems should be required to not only pay money to the people who&#39;s data they are using but also to contribute a common fund which will be used to create public AI models that can be used by anyone and fund training of people who might be displaced by the use of AI systems.  <br/><br/>We should also consider using this moment to reduce the amount of time that copyright is good for.  Having copyright be less would allow for the use of more material in public domain.  <br/>
