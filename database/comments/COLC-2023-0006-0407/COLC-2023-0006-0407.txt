I am an artist and photographer in the USA, and I strongly believe that Artificial Intelligence software that &quot;trains&quot; off of the copyrighted works of others without permission violates the copyright of those works and the rights of artists. Artists deserve protection against their work being used by these AI softwares, and this goes for all forms of art, from actors and writers to visual artists and photographers.
