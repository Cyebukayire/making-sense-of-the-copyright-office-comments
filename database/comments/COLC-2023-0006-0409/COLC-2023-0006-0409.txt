We need a new legal framework that is separate from copyright.<br/><br/>An LLM is constructed as a distillation of an enormous body of input - text, code, sound, video, etc.  Any of those specific items can be copyrighted.  Any of those items may have rightsholders who do not consent to having their content included in the training of the LLM.<br/><br/>After the distillation, people can use the LLM to create new works to solve their problems - and those works may bear a lot or very little resemblance to their sources - but all that the LLM can do is in some fashion restate what it has already absorbed (probabilistically, and with a lot of technical details and asterisks, but in essence that is the truth).<br/><br/>Consequently, one of the following is true, and we need new law to decide:<br/><br/>1. The social good of the LLM-as-concept is so great that the rights of the copyright holders are outweighed (possibly a fair use expansion) and thus they have no recourse.<br/>2. Any LLM will have to prove that all material used in its training was either not copyrighted, or permission was obtained (good luck proving that).<br/><br/>These are mutually exclusive propositions.<br/><br/>So if we go down the road of 1, we permit the general destruction of copyright as a concept, because derivative works will be just as good and there won&#39;t be any reason for people to pay rightsholders anymore.  But we get LLMs.<br/><br/>If we go down the road of 2, every LLM that exists today has to be deleted, and new ones will have a tough road to proving their content is acceptable.<br/><br/>I suggest we go down road 2, because theft is unacceptable, even if social good results.<br/><br/>As a practicing software engineer I make use of LLMs and receive benefit from them, but ultimately I think the technology is a land grab that is immoral and should be illegal.<br/>
