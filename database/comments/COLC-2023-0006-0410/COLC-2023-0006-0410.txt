Using haveibeentrained.com (which you can use to opt your stuff out if you find out it&#39;s being used) I found out several older pieces I&#39;d drawn were being used to train AI via the LAICON database. I didn&#39;t consent to that. No one asked me to use them, I wasn&#39;t being compensated in any way and no one even notified me that they were being used. I just HAPPENED to find them. I wasn&#39;t happy. Even now that I&#39;ve managed to opt those pieces out, I&#39;m still not happy. I feel somewhat like I was stolen from. And I&#39;m not the only artist dealing with this. Far more talented and well-known artists than I am are dealing with this and it&#39;s affecting their job opportunities - google is being flooded with art that isn&#39;t theirs but winds up tied to them with keywords because the generators mimicked their style and these generated images are drowning out their actual work. AI generated images are showing up at booths at conventions, affecting gig workers and small time artists. Artists who rely on conventions and commissions to pay their bills.<br/><br/>Artists have spent years building a skill, their craft, it&#39;s such an inherently human trait to create. To want to invoke an emotion or put your own out somewhere into the world. AI...isn&#39;t doing that. It&#39;s slapping something out in a few minutes ripped from other people&#39;s work. There&#39;s no innovation or inspiration behind it. There&#39;s no feeling or thought. And it has a direct negative impact on people. I feel like AI has its place in some things, but art and writing are definitely not it.
