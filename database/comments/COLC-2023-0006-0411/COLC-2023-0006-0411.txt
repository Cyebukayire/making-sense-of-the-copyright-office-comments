I strongly oppose giving AI &quot;art&quot; any form of copyright protection as they, more often than not, rely on other persons work to mimic. On more than one occasion I have seen AI &quot;art&quot; with butchered signatures from other artists who&#39;s artwork was taken and fed into the bot without their consent. I have also seen people use this to circumvent artists Terms Of Service or other copyrights or trademarks.
