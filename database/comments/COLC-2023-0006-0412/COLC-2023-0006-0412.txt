A) AIs should not be allowed to &quot;train&quot; on copyrighted material because 1) permission was not given by the copyright holder, 2) whatever the AI &quot;trains&quot; upon becomes material to &quot;produce&quot;. This also violates copyright since it is not fair use and often not a satire/parody. In many instances AI can be requested to reproduce a copyrighted work with minor/no changes. Although people talk about AIs being &quot;trained&quot;, it is a misnomer. Essentially, the database is a reference library that the AI uses to generate responses. Several experiments have shown that responses can be altered by including or excluding certain material. <br/>B) As a secondary matter, AI work should not be copyrightable. Often the work is a melange of other copyrighted works in its &quot;training&quot; database. The requestor is not a creator any more than someone typing in keywords into Google for a search is a &quot;creator&quot; of the list or any works within the list. In a similar way, DNA is generally not copyrightable except under certain circumstances. Furthermore, it is considered unethical and possibly illegal to copyright a genetic code stolen from someone else. Currently AIs do not create work. If the database does not have prior samples of something, the AI is unable to produce a satisfactory work. For example, if one requests &quot;draw an organically derived spaceship&quot; but eliminates all references to &quot;spaceships&quot; in the database, the AI will be unable to produce a satisfactory drawing because it does not have something to copy/frame. <br/>C) Because AI is dependent on its database, as already evident in several public examples, the AI can/will be as biased as its database. For example, recently an Asian woman requested that her photo be touched up to be more &quot;professional&quot;. However, the AI altered her photo to be a blond, blue-eyed woman.
