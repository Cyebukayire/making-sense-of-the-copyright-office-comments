My name is Isaac.  I create original content often.  I believe that if you&rsquo;re using an AI that has been offered by the company that owns it as a service to you to create original content based on your input, you should be able to copyright what it produces just like a ghost writer can give away the copyright to their work.  A graphic artist can also give away their right to content they&rsquo;ve created.   Original content from AI should be able to be copyrighted under correct spelled out scenarios.  <br/><br/>Also, as far as what it learned from: a human doesn&rsquo;t have to learn from only non-copyrighted material, so an AI should be able to learn from any material as well.
