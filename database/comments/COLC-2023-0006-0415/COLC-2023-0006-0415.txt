AI&#39;s training models are unethically produced, using images, text, and media without express permission of the creators of said &quot;source material&quot;. On this fact alone, AI should be restricted and forced to obtain consent for their training models. <br/><br/>AI&#39;s potential for &quot;disruption&quot; is also an existential threat to many creators and workers, eliminating their jobs or forcing workers into even more dismal conditions as they are phased out. If we had some safety net for the unemployed, or any safety net at all, that would be one thing. But as long as AI is owned by corporations and there are no safety nets, then AI should be heavily regulated. <br/><br/>AI also has a deleterious effect on our country&#39;s discourse and is incredibly dangerous. AI is a powerful tool to create misinformation, misrepresent people, and fill the internet with even more drivel. The fact there are AI written foraging and mushroom books being sold now (with no oversight as to their content, putting people at risk) is proof that AI cannot be allowed such free reign. What if an AI model was used to create hoaxes in the political field? Or to spread misinformation about vaccines?
