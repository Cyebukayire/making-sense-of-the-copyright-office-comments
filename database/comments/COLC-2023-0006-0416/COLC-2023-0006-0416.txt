It&#39;s important to begin, and swiftly, to erect regulations regarding the training, use, and naming of so-called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;. <br/><br/>NAMING: &quot;AI&quot; as it currently stands is a marketing term, and is grossly misleading as to the capabilities of these data-aggregating software systems. There is no intelligence behind them, and to continue to use this term risks confusing and potentially defrauding the consumers who use the product, by leading them to believe that the information they&#39;re receiving has thought or intelligence behind its creation. This is untrue: these are statistical models that use probability to determine a likely sequence of words, pixels, or other data points that might fulfill a user&#39;s request.<br/><br/>TRAINING: &quot;AI&quot; as it stands is trained on millions of copyrighted works, in overwhelming part without the consent or permission of the creators and copyright holders of those works. If an individual did this it would be decried as &quot;piracy&quot;; but since corporations are doing it and individual human beings are the victims, it is proclaimed to be &quot;the progress of technology&quot;. We need immediate regulation of &quot;AI&quot; training data sets, including regulations specifically requiring the disclosure of exactly what works a given &quot;AI&quot; model was trained on and regulations requiring corporations and individuals that train &quot;AI&quot; models to obtain the permission of copyright holders before using copyrighted works in their training sets.<br/><br/>USE: The owners of the &quot;AI&quot; models should be required by law to disclose, prominently and in no uncertain terms, that their tools are not intelligent in any way, that they are mere statistical models, and that the results they provide may not be accurate in any sense of the term, merely the next statistically likely set of data points arising from the prompt. In addition, the users of &quot;AI&quot; should be required by law to disclose, prominently and in no uncertain terms, that any work they publish that substantially arises from the use of these tools was generated by a statistical model and not by a human creator. The latter is especially necessary if the owners of the &quot;AI&quot; tools are not barred from using copyrighted materials without permission to generate their training sets.<br/><br/>Finally, regulations should be set in place establishing that, as with works created by animals and other forces of nature, any text, image, or other work generated by an artificial intelligence cannot be copyrighted.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
