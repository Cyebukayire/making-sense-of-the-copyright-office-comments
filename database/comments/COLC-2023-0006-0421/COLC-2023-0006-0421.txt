Artificial intelligence is not a unilaterally evil or dangerous thing in its current state. As is, i believe fears of AI-takeovers are still well within the realm of fiction. However, it has been made quite clear how many businesses-specifically large corporate entities, seek to utilize it. in the last few months, we have seen many creative-based jobs get pushed aside in hopes that AI programs such as ChatGPT (for written works) or Stable Diffusion (for artistry). And what is worse is that the exploitation of these processes go both ways. On the other side, the neural networks create their works based on the collection of human-made data off the internet, often without direct permission or awareness, and then attempt to reconfigure it into something that matches the prompts they are given. The outcome is something that is derivative at best, and uncanny at worst.<br/><br/>To wit, it is in my humble opinion that I would request that any venture or business that utilizes AI in place of human involvement be met with significant scrutiny. AI is not a replacement for human knowledge, or effort. It can be support and supplement, but it cannot and should not replace any one person or position that they might hold.
