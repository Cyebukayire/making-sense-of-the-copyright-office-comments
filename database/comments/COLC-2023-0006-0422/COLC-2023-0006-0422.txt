I am in support of regulating generative artificial intelligence in art and other media. In my personal experience I have seen people use generative AI to claim to be artists and profit as such while putting in as little labor as possible in the creation of the piece of media that they claimed to have created. Instead of putting in the time and effort to learn and develop the skill and acuity to create art, they steal media from another artists and run it through a program or programs that have databases built on even more stolen media to generate a slightly different media at the command of a handful of prompts. They have left the labor of creating the media solely to machines and machine learning and removed the human factor, the factor that defines any piece of media as art, from the media that have &quot;created.&quot; Such is why I am in support of regulating generative artificial intelligence. It will protect the jobs of hardworking individuals, and protect them from malicious actions, whether saidbactiosn are from other individuals or corporations.
