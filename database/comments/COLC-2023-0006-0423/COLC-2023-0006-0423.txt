I think AI poses an existential threat to art, to creativity and even to normal administrative jobs in America as mentioned by one of its creators Geoffrey Hinton. Corporations have already become mammoth profit machines that have caused huge income inequality. They almost need to be saved from themselves. If they are allowed to adopt AI as a standard, I think it will lead to the downfall of this nation, killing jobs and making people unable to afford the very products and services they sell. The creative community, of which I am a part as a successful Hollywood writer and actor, has been embroiled in a a four month long fight with the corporate studios who refuse to recognize this danger and has already caused significant pain and distress to one of the few industries where America still truly has the number one place in the world. AI has the potential to ruin human creativity, replace millions of jobs that people have worked and trained for, plus if allowed to run unchecked, can surpass human ability to control it. Again, as mentioned by Mr. Hinton who had a huge part in creating it. Please continue to protect human lives and livelihoods as other fellow human beings.
