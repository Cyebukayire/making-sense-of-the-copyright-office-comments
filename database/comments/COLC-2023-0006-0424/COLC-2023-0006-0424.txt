Unregulated AI represents an existential detriment not only to several job-providing industries, but also to safety and trust in institutions. By allowing a glut of generated &quot;content&quot; the internet would be inundated with junk news and articles and render massive swaths of web unusable. The dissemination of misinformation alone would be catastrophic to news gathering and spreading, resulting in a misinformed, uneducated populace. For the betterment of society, AI must be regulated in all its forms.
