I believe that the best course of action is to consider works entirely generated with AI tools to be non-copyrighted works. I do not think the output constitutes the requirement of minimal creativity. I do however, believe that works that are assisted by AI (in the sense of using a synthesizer as a part of a song) should be worthy of copyright, at least the sections that are made by humans.
