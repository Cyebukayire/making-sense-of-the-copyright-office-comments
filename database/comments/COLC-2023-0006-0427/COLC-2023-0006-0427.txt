Obviously AI works (as defined by current technology) can&#39;t be copyrighted because they 1) fail the test of originality, there&#39;s no original thought or thought of any kind in an AI work, because AI don&#39;t think and 2) AI are nonhuman. As was found in Naruto v Slater &quot;if Congress and the president intended to take the extraordinary step of authorizing animals [in this case, AI] as well as people and legal entities to sue, they could, and should, have said so&quot;<br/><br/>plainly.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute#Naruto_v._David_Slater_et_al.
