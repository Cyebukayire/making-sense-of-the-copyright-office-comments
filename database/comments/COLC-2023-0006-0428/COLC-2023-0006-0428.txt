I believe that using someone&#39;s art (incl. drawings, stories, videos, audio recordings and any other method of creating art) as part of a dataset for generative AI without the knowledge and consent of that person should be a violation of copyright law. I don&#39;t believe that AI generated material should be able to be copyrighted, since the creator of that material, the generative AI, is not a person.
