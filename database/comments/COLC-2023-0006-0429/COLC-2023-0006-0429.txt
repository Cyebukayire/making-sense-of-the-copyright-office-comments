Hello, I am an individual who enjoys writing and making art in my spare time. In a kinder world, I would have loved to make a living out of expressing myself artistically. However, I still enjoy creating art and sharing it with my friends and family via social media and the internet. My intention when I create and share art is not to &quot;feed&quot; any artificial intelligence roaming the internet in search of material to steal from its rightful owner in the name of &quot;training&quot;. If the companies behind such artificial intellegence systems wish to obtain data on which to train their product, they should purchase it just like every other customer of artistic and creative endeavors. Those individuals who do make a living out of their creative endeavors deserve just compensation for the labor and education that have gone into such creations. A future where AI is allowed to steal freely from any human who uses the internet is a bleak one. Please help us protect the human spark of creativity and passion that brings joy to us all.
