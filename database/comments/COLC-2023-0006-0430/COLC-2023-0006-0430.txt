Works created by AI should not be allowed copyright protection as they lack real human input. &#39;AI&#39; is, in truth, simply machine learning that spits out amalgamations of other people&#39;s work. Training these machine learning tools also requires the unlawful use of copyrighted works to &#39;teach&#39; the machine. In all, AI is a mess of copyright infringements already and to say that these products should, themselves, be allowed to be copyrighted will only lead to a mess of lawsuits later.
