AI should basically be outright banned. All it does is basically take away jobs from hard working people. Considering that many studios such as Warner Bros. Discovery want to replace working people who are on strike with AI is a clear sign that it not only needs to be regulated but also banned. Sure, if it can be implemented properly by people who understand it, it would be nice but I disagree 100%. It&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to see AI be something that can replace people.
