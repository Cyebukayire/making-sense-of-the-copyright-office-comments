Artificial Intelligence and its use is, at its core, detrimental to every and all creative endeavors. To take art away from human hands and have a machine falsely replicate it with no emotion, no passion, and no skill: it is not art at all. AI in creative spaces does nothing but raise questions about copyright ethics while also putting entire industries of creative individuals out of their jobs. <br/><br/>AI creates a financial strain on both creators and lawmakers. Creators must fight for their copyright when their artwork or writing is used to feed AI and courts, already backlogged, will be overrun with copyright claims to a point that creative people, spaces, and content will slowly but surely disappear. Without humans creating the art being stolen for AI training, there will be nothing for AI to be trained with.<br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence is not an infinite resource and it is not self-sustaining. It is misnamed in a way that ignores its human operators, who are stealing everything from copyrighted work to private documents to your social media posts. It is misnamed in a way that suggests the machine it runs through is sentient or capable of sentience. In reality, it is not intelligence of any kind. It is coded software to detect patterns and to mimic patterns. <br/><br/>As an artist in book publishing, it&rsquo;s a terrifying reality to have to include clauses in my contract that prohibits the use of my work in AI, whether that be AI training, use of AI to make work similar to mine, or use of AI to finish my uncompleted work. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to fight for my copyright at every turn. <br/><br/>AI as it exists now in art is not a step forward into an easier future. It is not a bright nor progressive future if machines are putting hard working artists, authors, designers, etc. out of jobs that are crucial to community, connection, and equitable societies.<br/>
