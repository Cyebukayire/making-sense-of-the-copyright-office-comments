AI as it exists now is not artificial intelligence. Its only capability is to analyze pre-existing work (typically created by humans, but it could theoretically analyze work created by other AI networks if that is put into its dataset) and then to shuffle that around to try to create something &quot;new.&quot; However, this &quot;new&quot; thing is a random collage at best, but more often than not, it&#39;s plagiarism. Anything produced by current AI is little more than a copy-paste version of human work. AI as it exists now does not have the &quot;intelligence&quot; necessary to create new things with purpose. The AI does not know why a human prompts it for different things; the AI has simply been programmed to recognize different terms, and to produce outputs within a certain set of parameters when prompted for those recognized terms.<br/>Therefore, AI produced work should not be able to have copyright. Additionally, AI should only be trained on work that is either already in the public domain, or if the programmers of the AI have obtained permission from the humans who created the initial work. (Or, in the case of things like art produced as work-for-hire, permission must be obtained from the human who owns the copyright on the work, as it might not be the original artist in that case.)<br/>As an artist, I never gave permission for AI to regurgitate my work. I was never asked if it would be all right with me.
