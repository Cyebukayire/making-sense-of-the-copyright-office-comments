If you allow AI-generated plagiarism to be copyrighted, it will bring about the single largest transfer of wealth from the artists who create things to the rapacious corporate stooges bent on exploiting them. <br/><br/>Not only will this be ruinous for artists on a financial level, it will be damaging to art itself. <br/><br/>The evolution of films, TV, books, paintings, music will come to a screeching halt. There will be no more inventiveness or creativity. All that will remain is &quot;content&quot;: soulless iteration after iteration of &quot;this old popular thing-meets that old popular thing&quot; flotsam clogging up every single outlet.<br/><br/>Furthermore, artists generate income. Our tax dollars help fund healthcare, education, public services etc. A line of code (which is all AI is) serves nothing and aids no one but the tax-evading bureaucrats that seek to wield it.<br/><br/>Don&#39;t let this happen. Protect art. Protect artists. Preserve the soul of this country.
