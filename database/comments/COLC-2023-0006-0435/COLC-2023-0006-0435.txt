As someone with Autism and ADHD, I have found many freeing things about AI generative art. To watch it go under the bus like music did in the 20th century, is frightening. A personal view on this: I find this more to be an ethics and philosophy issue than a full copyright issue. To copyright art styles, or photography images like this is to copyright a street lamp - sure the DESIGN of the street lamp is patented, but if someone drew a street lamp are you going to sue them for drawing a street lamp? (I&#39;m sure someone has already, don&#39;t mind me I forgot how dumb human beings can be) Furthermore, I am an artist before starting to work in AI generative media, I have a degree in communication design - I have literally trained models on my own photography - Would i then get to sue myself?  I trained it on my own art, and. still felt shunned to the point that &quot;You are a liar, you stole that work&quot; - yet i&#39;m the one who drew it.  Yes, there are ethics in this field, but this field has caused NORMAL art discourse to become: &quot;everything you do is wrong, everything is racist and you should feel bad - btw someone else drew that you stole it&quot;.  As well as that numerous amounts of Artist youtubers have taken the chance to bring their fans against AI Generative media to a point that it&#39;s becoming a witch hunt, one that borderlines on online bullying and harassment at times. While yes i&#39;ve lost friends locally due to being involved in this field, I&#39;ve also struggled to find decent work due to my ADHD/Autism and other diagnosis - i&#39;m 40 years old - as much as that&#39;s not young anymore - people do not like hiring neurodivergent people that are 40 as often.  Struggling to get freelance work as a designer, and as an artist, has always - ALWAYS frustrated me.  AI generative art? I&#39;ve been able to finally pay for things, not a lot - but I&#39;m no longer screaming to pay rent between my disability payments and other things. Small amounts of commissions, sponsorships have enabled me to feel valued finally.  So I urge the US government to listen to both sides, not just the corporate side.  Not just the &quot;I&#39;m an artist and so and so stole my style&quot; - but every single side to the story.  I&#39;m sure mine will get buried underneath and i&#39;ll find i&#39;m dealing with having to Quit AI art next year -but at least i&#39;ve attempted to fight for what I feel is right. Thank you for that opportunity, that means a lot for me.
