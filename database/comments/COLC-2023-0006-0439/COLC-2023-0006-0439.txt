Devaluing the work, contribution, and creativity of human beings is going to be very bad for a healthy, functioning society. Please regulate AI. Please do not let AI replace human beings in jobs -- any jobs. We have to recognize what we&#39;re doing to ourselves. Just because something is possible, doesn&#39;t mean it should be done. Please. Do not put profits over people.
