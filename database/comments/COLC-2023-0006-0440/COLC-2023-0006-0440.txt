Ai is extremely exploitative. Not only are the databases full of stolen and copyrighted artwork (which most of the artists did not get permission to have their work in those databases), the artists who have their work in those databases are not being compensated.<br/>This also extends to things like real photos, written work, etc. <br/>when we go further, if ai was allowed copyright, the amount of people this would negatively effects is astonishing. The art industry (ranging from digital art, to voice over, acting, 3D modeling, etc) will become so much more exploitative. It&rsquo;ll line the pockets of the rich, and hurt and undervalue artists and actors even more than now. You&rsquo;d be turning an industry stale, soulless, bland.<br/>Please listen to artists, listen to actors, listen to the innocent people who have had their likeness stolen from ai.<br/>
