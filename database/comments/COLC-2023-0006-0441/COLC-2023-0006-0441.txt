I genuinely believe that copyright law was meant to foster and reward HUMAN creation.  It was not meant to give corporations the ability to use AI to steal copyrights and ownership from their true creators and authors.  It is tenant of copyright law that a human must have created the product. Furthermore, I believe that the United States employs a great deal of people who are dependent on copyright benefits for their livelihoods.  Were that law to be diluted, in favor of AI copyright protection, it would gut the economic prospects for a significant portion of the population and cause unemployment and wealth inequality to skyrocket.  This is something that could be a game-changer for the US economy, and the copyright office is the last thing standing between the US continuing to prosper and the degradation of one of its&#39; fundamental sources of wealth.
