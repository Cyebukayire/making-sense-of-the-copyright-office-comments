I&rsquo;m my opinion any content compiled by an AI system which was trained using copyrighted material is in violation of the copyright.  These systems should be trained using only public domain content or content created by the tech companies themselves.  Using other people&rsquo;s work especially that of copyright protected work is a deliberately offense against creative works.  The novelty and complexity of the AI systems is circumventing the intention of copyright protection and special considerations should be implemented to protect artists from this kind and any future novel innovations that deliberately circumvent the spirit as well as the letter of copyright protection.
