Artificial intelligence in its current incarnation is merely a program designed to scrape existing works and assemble collages based off their data.  It cannot truly create in its current state.  By taking &quot;prompts&quot; from users (a very miniscule effort in proportion by the human side of AI-generated works) and building based off existing data, it is little more than a compiling and rendering program.  It cannot truly create, and until an artificial intelligence truly &quot;creates&quot; in the manner of humanity, its generated objects must not be able to be copyrighted.  If it becomes able to be copyrighted, there are woefully insufficient regulations and other controls in place in both law and private businesses over what the programs are allowed to collect data from.  Even if they were classified as a derivative work, proper crediting, royalties, etc. would be a nightmare to untangle as these programs are fed millions of works to use as bases.  Before an AI work can even be considered to be able to be copyrighted, it must first pass all the rules and regulations of human-created works.<br/><br/>
