My name is Andy Schauer. I am entertainment lawyer based in Los Angeles and partner of the firm Schauer Law Group LLP. As you know, &quot;generative artificial intelligence&quot; (&quot;GAI&quot;) is &quot;trained&quot; on existing material, with the idea being that, over time, it will be able to furnish better, more accurate answers. In actual practice, this poses a plethora of problems.<br/><br/>First (and, I think, foremost) is how GAIs are &quot;trained.&quot; Although it&#39;s possible to exclusively train GAI on public domain (or otherwise unprotected/unprotectable material), there are numerous reasons why that may not be desirable. For example, many (if not most or perhaps even all) current GAI users want responses that incorporate modern materials and knowledge; however, that would necessarily mean incorporating protected works. Indeed, my understanding is that many (if not most or perhaps even all) current GAI proprietors have trained their software on copyrighted material, at least some of which is ill-gotten.<br/><br/>To me, the most obvious solution would be to force GAI owners to record and disclose all materials on which their product was trained (and to ensure the GAI cannot access protected intellectual property). As a blanket proposition, though, that could substantially hamstring developers&#39; efforts to make GAI into an actually-useful tool. Perhaps an ASCAP- or BMI-type service could help these developers (or even individual users) quickly and conveniently license works for this type of use.<br/><br/>At its core, the problem with GAI is that it can&#39;t not plagiarize. It&#39;s a fundamentally human spark of creativity that prevents new works from falling into this same trap and -- while I am open to contrary evidence and this may not hold true forever -- I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a way to duplicate that artificially. In short, then, the only way to make GAI useful is to enable it to respond to humans&#39; specific inquiries... but a human being has to actually synthesize GAI&#39;s output somehow for it to ethically and logically make sense to extend copyright protections to such works. GAI is not capable (at least on its own) of creating something with the de minimis element of creativity necessary for protection to vest.
