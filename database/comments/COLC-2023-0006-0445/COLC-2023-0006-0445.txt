As the current iteration of &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; stands, the works those programs output should not be copyrightable. This is due, in part, to the fact that the AI - the machine - has done all the legwork rather than a human being. AI can assist in the process of creation, of course, but the actual primary act of creation should be done through a human being. However, this is not my nor many other&#39;s actual key concern with AI-generated works. The primary concern is with the databases that these AI programs run off of.<br/><br/>Every AI program that I am aware of - Midjourney, ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, to list some popular choices - does not have an ethically sourced database. By that I mean these databases are filled with information and data that has been indiscriminately scraped off the internet, with no attention to where the images are from or whether they have existing copyright. Then the AI itself draws from that database filled with copyright or personal images as it sees fit, producing works that are just a finely blended smoothie of already preexisting data. Not only are these AI not &#39;creating&#39; anything, and instead just regurgitating already existing media in a high-tech fashion, but the data it is using is of actual copyrightable material. <br/><br/>Every AI piece of art is just data taken from existing images, every AI text is just data ripped from books and scripts, and every AI voice is just chopped up data of real people&#39;s actual voices. There is no true &#39;creation,&#39; nothing truly new or original. On the surface it may seem new, but that work would not exist without the AI using the literal, actual data of thousands of other preexisting works. Without the database to pull from, the AI can not create.<br/><br/>Overall, the act of creation must be done by a human being to be copyrightable. Until AI can reliably create something truly original - not just repurposed data points of media with already existing copyright - then AI works can&#39;t even begin to be treated the same as human crafted ones. By &#39;original&#39; I mean something new to the AI produced by the AI. A toddler may draw a cat and the cat itself is not an original idea, but it is an original creation by the toddler.
