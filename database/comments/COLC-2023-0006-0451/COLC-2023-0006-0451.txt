AI work, whether art, screenplay, writing, or design is not really art!! It should not be copyrighted! It&#39;s just stealing from real artists and mashing things together to fill a prompt! Art is what makes us human! Companies want AI generated work to be copyright able just so they don&#39;t have to pay artists!
