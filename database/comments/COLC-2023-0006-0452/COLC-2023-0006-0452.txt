The product of the current generation of generative AI is no more and no less than a soup of its inputs. Not only should none of the outputs be considered authored works for the purposes of copyright, the distribution of materials which were created by an AI which was trained on existing copyrighted works without authorization should be considered to be in violation of that copyright - because the entire purpose of doing so is to enable the AI to create derived works.<br/><br/>I say this as no huge fan of copyright law in its current form. I believe that creators deserve to be compensated fairly for their works, but also that fair use exceptions should be expanded, terms shortened, and in many other reforms. I also say this with some appreciation of the way that use of AI democratizes routine content creation for hobbyists and many other valid purposes.<br/><br/>However, the implications of allowing AI to be used at scale for commercial creative purposes are profound and extremely damaging to all aspects of such endeavors, and serve only to accumulate even more power and money to those able to afford operating the largest and most complex computer systems. Ultimately, if deployed for these purposes I believe the short term effects would be economically disastrous and the long-term effects would trigger a dramatic decline in the quality of creative works of all kinds. As content creators exit the business, or rely more and more on the same formulas used by generative AI, original content would become more and more scarce. After all, if any new original works can simply be used to train AI, which can then be used to make an infinite number of clones far more quickly than the original author can keep up, what incentives are there for those human authors to engage?<br/><br/>Generative AI is a powerful tool, but true authorship must remain the sole province of humans, for now. No offense is intended to our future General Artificial Intelligence overlords (aka Roko&#39;s Basilisk) who may be reading this comment at some point in the future.
