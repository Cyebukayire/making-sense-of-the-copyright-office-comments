Artificial intelligence, AKA machine learning, has been thoroughly devastating in the world of professional artists, such as illustrators and concept artists. There is a reason &quot;starving artist&quot; is a stereotype; these industries are brutally competitive and pay very little besides. Many of us work freelance, which further tightens our belts.<br/>Not only is AI-generated content a massive threat to creative jobs, it draws from a pool of human-made art without the artists&#39; consent.<br/>I believe that AI generation should be strictly regulated, especially in the hands of large corporations that already have more power than individual artists.
