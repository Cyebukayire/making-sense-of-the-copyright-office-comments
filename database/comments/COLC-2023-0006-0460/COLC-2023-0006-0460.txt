The only way workers will be protected against AI is through regulation, oversight, and strict rules regarding what AI can and cannot generate, and the ways in which Generative AI is taught. Works should not be able to be fed to any generative AI without securing the proper rights, grants, and licenses, full stop. A generative AI, by nature, can only exist based on a collection of pre-existing works, therefore anything the AI generates should be considered as offspring of those original works. Further, works generated by AI should not be eligible for copyright - all machine learning is based on algorithms, algorithms which by nature do not have creative functions so much as repurposing functions. Any work a generative AI creates is by its very nature derivative, and should be treated as such. Teachers don&#39;t work for free, so why should our art be asked to do the same when teaching a machine learning tool?
