While AI does certainly have its uses in programming and machine learning and the general field of robotics, the us of AI in a creative context is unethical, immoral, and irresponsible. AI is not meant to be a creative tool, it is not meant to take the place of artists, writers, graphic designers, and other creatives. AI is meant to take over the menial tasks so humans can focus on the creative aspects of life, not the other way around. Please heavily regulate the usage of AI and limit it away from the creative industries of art, animation, writing, filmmaking, and more.
