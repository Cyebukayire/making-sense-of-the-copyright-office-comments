A device that is owned by someone else and absorbs, copies and emulates art by human artists should absolutely not be acceptable as a form of copyright. There aren&#39;t even enough laws in place to address the plagiarism this creates or a proper verification process to confirm if a piece of art/content/information has been created by AI. There is no logical reason to make a copyright available to an AI other than to put the original creators of it&#39;s emulated work out of business.
