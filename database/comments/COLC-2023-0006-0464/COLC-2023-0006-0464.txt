I have four published books and several published fanzines. I am a holder of Copyrights. Years ago, I chose to opt-out of the Google Books scanning program. I have come to see that as a grave mistake. Personal interest is sometimes best served by the public interest. This is why we have public libraries. This is why we once had shorter Copyright terms to enable a flourishing public domain. Copyrighted material as the raw material to train AI is no crime.  No AI will suddenly start spitting out duplications of the books they have ingested. The books are used for understanding, not duplication. I believe that it is in the best interest of the public good to grant AI companies a waiver for AI ingestion of Copyrighted material. You can be certain that countries that don&#39;t adhere to our Copyright laws will not hesitate to use our books and materials to train their AIs. And we would therefore fall behind and be hobbled by foreign competitors. The narrow interests of my fellow writers should not override the public interest and public good of this matter. The narrow interests of my fellow writers should not override the public interest and public good of this matter. All of us would benefit in ways we cannot yet begin to imagine.
