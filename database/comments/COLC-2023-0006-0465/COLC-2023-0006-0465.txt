As a published author I am very concerned about the unregulated use of published materials to train AI and the likely impact on author income. <br/><br/>While AI can have some uses, the only benefit to &quot;training&quot; it using published works is to remove the author from the publication process. <br/><br/>Art matters. Creators matter. It is the government&#39;s job to protect its citizens from corporate greed and this is a clear example of businesses looking to increase their bottom line off the hard work of authors who are already largely poorly compensated. <br/><br/>A computer cannot understand all the varied nuances of the human experience and we should not desire it to. Save AI for practical tasks, not a poor attempt to recreate the human imagination.
