AI as it is utilized today does not create. It steals and remixes other people&#39;s work. The ability to copyright other people&#39;s work is insanity. And theft, in terms of utilizing various works across the internet without the permission of those creatives, is clearly morally wrong. AI, as it is currently being used, is little more than the predictive text function on a phone, but based on theft. I am not a creator of online content, and find myself disgusted by how many people who&#39;s work I will financially back have had their IP stolen by AI systems. Please do not allow legalized theft to continue.
