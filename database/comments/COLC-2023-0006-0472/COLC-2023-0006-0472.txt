I am an academic. When I conduct academic research, I review a wide array of material, including primary and secondary source materials. I sometimes quote from other sources, and demonstrate in my citations how my ideas have been shaped by the work of others. Without a comprehensive citation system and requirements for attribution as is the very nature of AI-created text and images, this seems that it inappropriately uses others&#39; labor without credit where it is due. The construction of new images and texts based on machine-read data should not be allowed to follow different rules of plagiarism than images and texts made from human-read material.
