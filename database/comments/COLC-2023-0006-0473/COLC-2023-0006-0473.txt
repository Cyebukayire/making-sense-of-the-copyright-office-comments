Much like other tools, AI itself is just that: A tool.<br/><br/>There is a distinct lack of understanding on what constitutes an AI-generated work; while systems like ChatGPT are a little more hands-free, others, such as Stable Diffusion, frequently do require a lot of user input in order to produce quality works.<br/><br/>Additionally, systems like Stable Diffusion allow folks who are handicapped to continue to express creativity; either by using existing models, training new models, or supplementing a model with your existing body of work in order to create new works in your style.<br/><br/>I personally have utilized Stable Diffusion in multiple contexts to create unique works; In most cases I am creating an initial seed image along with clever prompting and settings tweaks in order to generate multiple parts of a single piece, combining them into something even more unique.<br/><br/>Much like any other medium, I always disclose when AI was utilized in my process for a piece; mixed-media artwork included.<br/><br/>AI won&#39;t replace creatives; it just makes creativity more accessible, and provides a new tool for creative people to create new work.<br/><br/>As it pertains to recreating existing copyrighted material.. That&#39;s something that can be done already. Via basic screenshots, copy/pasting, saving, photographing and more, people regularly steal existing works and claim them as their own. This is nothing new, and to recreate something specific utilizing AI is much more work than any other method available.<br/><br/>As far as it pertains to training on copyrighted material, again, this isn&#39;t dissimilar from how existing artists learn.. By studying existing works, and even recreating them in alternative styles. This is a common teaching method, and AI training models just take it to a larger scale.
