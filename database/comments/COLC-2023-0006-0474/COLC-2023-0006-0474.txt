Saw this article: US Copyright Office wants to hear what people think about AI and copyright - The Verge<br/><br/>And so here I am, with thoughts.<br/><br/>(1) How should AI models use copyrighted data in training?<br/>Opt-in only. This is the only path to ensure consent, compensation, credit, and transparency.<br/>Notably, existing models not built around opt-in from the beginning should be destroyed.<br/><br/>(2) Should AI-generated material be copyrighted even without a human involved?<br/>No. That would consolidate power further into the hands of those already powerful enough to leverage AI (Big Tech).<br/>Our copyright laws should be human-centered from this point forward. It&#39;s long overdue.<br/><br/>(3) How should copyright liability work with AI?<br/>Not a clue, but I wish your team the best in figuring it out.<br/><br/>Thank you for soliciting input from the public and not leaving it up to Big Tech to decide for us, once again.
