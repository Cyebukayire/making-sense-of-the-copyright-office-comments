AI should not be permitted to be copyrighted.  Full stop.  Most (if not all) AI platforms are created from and use scrapings from other artists&#39; work, be that visual, literary, or even vocal.  They steal work that is already copyrighted in quite a few instances, so allowing the result to also be copyrighted is a slope no one should think about going down.  &#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39; isn&#39;t even an appropriate name for the technology, as it&#39;s not intelligent and not &#39;learning&#39; anything. It&#39;s taking work from human artists and using it to create a bastardized result.  If we allow AI to copyright stolen work, should then every artistic forgery also be permitted to be copyrighted?
