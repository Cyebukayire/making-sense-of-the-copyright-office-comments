These &quot;AI&quot; machines are nothing more than plagarism machines.  If you can go to an AI and put in that you want something in a particular artist&#39;s style, and that artist has not given permission for their art to be used to train that AI, THEN HOW DOES IT HAVE SAMPLES OF THEIR ART IN ITS TRAINING.  Same for writers.  For voice actors, I don&#39;t see how that can be viewed as anything other than identity theft.  That is their voice, and it has been stolen in order to avoid paying them for a job.  This is theft.  I do not understand how it has been allowed to go this far.  I am tired of watching this nonsense.  If &quot;AI&quot; is to continue at a MINIMUM they must release their training data.
