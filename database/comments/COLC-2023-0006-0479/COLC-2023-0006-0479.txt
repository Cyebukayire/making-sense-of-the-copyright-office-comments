Until an AI is declaired sentient [by meeting an as yet unagreed to standard] its products should not be patentable. A patent protects the products of original thought.  AI at best, is a machine owned by a human or human organization. If an AI was sentient and not independent, the ownerswhip issue could be considered slavery in which case patenting the products of slave labor would be morally wrong. Keep patents for humans until AI is sentient and independent.
