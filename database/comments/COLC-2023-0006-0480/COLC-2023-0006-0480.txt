I am a writer and I post fictional content on websites like https://archiveofourown.org/. I don&rsquo;t intend to make a profit from this content, but it&rsquo;s still my intellectual property and I don&rsquo;t want it scraped to train AI. There are many amazing cases in which AI can be incredibly useful to our society. Science, medicine and much more, I&rsquo;m sure. However, writing, art and music are not one of them. Even before AI began to become a reality, artists of all media had been struggling to make a living. A computer does not need to make art, especially when it learned how to do so from artists who have not been compensated for their contributions at all. I think people should be able to sue for the use of their IP in AI.
