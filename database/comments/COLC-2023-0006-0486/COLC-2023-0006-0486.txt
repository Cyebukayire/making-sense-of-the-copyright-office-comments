<br/>I&#39;m a small independent vector artist and even though I&#39;m small I found that my work was used to train Artificial Intelligence models. As of today I get no say in it, much less economic compensation. I don&#39;t think the images these models produce deserve copyright protections, and I wish the government would step in and defend our rights as creators. Sadly, it seems most people think creatives were born with some sort of privilege or innate talent when the reality is we work hard to be able to survive in this industry. AI is currently destroying and devaluing it with it&#39;s completely unfair trade practices.
