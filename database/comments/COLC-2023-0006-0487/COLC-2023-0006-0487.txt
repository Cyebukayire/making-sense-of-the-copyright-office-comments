AI is a tool for stealing the hard work of others. This deceptively-named technology takes the crafted work of artists and writers and blends it together to repeat the work. The creators of the work being used have no say in this. Even if every creator gave their unanimous consent to such a project, it still would not alter the fundamental reality that copying work does not deserve copyright protection. Users of AI tools have no better claim to copyright what they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;created&rdquo; than a thief who&rsquo;s taken a novel from a bookstore has to copyright its text. <br/><br/>Thank you for opening up this important issue to comments.
