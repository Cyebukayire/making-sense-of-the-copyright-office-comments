So-called AI generated content is, without question, the most unethical technology currently available to consumers as of the opening of this comment period. With perhaps one to two extremely narrow exceptions outside research and academia, the entire purpose of programs like Chat-GPT and Midjourney is to steal (or &ldquo;scrape&rdquo;) the work of human artists and content creators without acknowledgement or consent. Allowing this blatant violation of artistic principle to be copyrighted in any situation is an affront to the concept of creativity, and will spell the slow death of several industries, including and not limited to animation, voiceover artistry, two- and three-dimensional artworks, and creative writing. Moreover, by allowing these kinds of generated pieces to be acceptable, let alone copyrighted, will encourage the use of deepfakes. In an age where misinformation and disinformation is rampant, and our very democratic process as a nation is under threat, I cannot in good conscience support AI being allowed legal protection.  Support real artists, not machines.
