I do not think AI should be allowed to copywrite things. AI pulls from other sources, therefore those original sources could be kept under copywrite but the AI shouldn&#39;t because it&#39;s just amalgamating someone else&#39;s work. As an author myself, I would hate to have oy work stolen by a machine for someone else&#39;s profit.
