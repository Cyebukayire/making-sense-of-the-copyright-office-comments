Large language models, and other generative AI represent not only a threat to the livelihoods of artists and creators in many fields, they are built off of the works of these very same artists, without acknowledgement or consent. Their training databases and processes are often not disclosed, but it is evident simply through understanding how these models function that they are unable to create truly &quot;novel&quot; content that is not simply a product of the statistical analysis of the vast corpus of data they are fed. I would like to see legislation that protects the interests of individual creators and artists, and respects their rights to their own work. If allowed to go unchecked, as it currently does, the stealing of artist&#39;s creative output in order to build these so-called &quot;generative&quot; AI will only escalate.
