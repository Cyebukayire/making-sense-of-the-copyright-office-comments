While AI can be a &quot;tool&quot; for people, using it commercially is very dangerous and even AI itself is illegal, since it uses art (art as well as writing, drawing, photography, etc.) It is not the intellectual property of the companies that are dedicated to creating these models, such as ChatGPT or Midjourney.<br/><br/>Also the use of AI to simulate voices of people who are no longer with us or using voices of actors who are still alive for commercial use should be strictly prohibited, as it is both a legal and moral fault.
