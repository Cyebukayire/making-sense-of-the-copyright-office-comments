Dear Sir/Madam,<br/><br/>In light of the recent query from the Copyright Office regarding copyright implications in artificial intelligence, I wish to voice my perspective on the matter. I strongly advocate for generative AI systems, including Stable Diffusion, to remain accessible and open source for the general public.<br/><br/>The following are the primary reasons, grounded in both legal and ethical principles, why restricting access to models like Stable Diffusion is unwarranted:<br/><br/>1.  AI models serve as instruments and tools, not creative entities. Restricting these models parallels the hindrance of free expression by limiting access to traditional creative tools like pens or paintbrushes. The originality of user outputs deserves scrutiny, rather than the tools employed.<br/>2. Training AI models typically involves leveraging data from the public domain or open licenses. For instance, Stable Diffusion utilized LAION&#39;s dataset, which consists of 5 billion images from the internet under the Creative Commons license. Denying public access to models derived from public datasets presents significant ethical and legal challenges.<br/>3. A conducive environment for research and development is one that is open. There&#39;s a risk that legal ambiguities surrounding generative models could push AI endeavors into obscurity, curbing the general public&#39;s ability to oversee potential biases and dangers. Open models pave the way for comprehensive supervision.<br/>4. The current copyright framework already offers mechanisms to address illicit uses of AI-produced content. Thus, there&#39;s minimal rationale to impose added constraints on the technology. The existing legal safeguards are adequate.<br/>5. Restricting AI model access may disproportionately affect individuals such as researchers, students, and creators who lack the substantial resources of major tech conglomerates. An open model approach ensures a balanced competitive landscape.<br/><br/>To encapsulate, fostering open access to generative AI systems promotes creativity, drives innovation, and ensures ethical progression within this technology. I respectfully urge the Copyright Office to uphold the public&#39;s AI advancements by dismissing suggestions to limit access to models like Stable Diffusion. I am available for a more in-depth discussion should you find it necessary.<br/><br/>Your kind attention to this matter is deeply appreciated.<br/><br/>Warm regards,<br/>Todd Wolven,<br/>NeoTitan Industries LLC.
