I believe that since the tech is here, it should be up to the individual on whether or not they want to utilize AI as a tool or a writing assistant. However, AI should not be able to hold copyright without human input. Human creators only. Something should be done to protect professional writers from producers and other entities that want to hire us to rewrite something quickly generated by AI. Not sure how to regulate that, but it&rsquo;s a dream.
