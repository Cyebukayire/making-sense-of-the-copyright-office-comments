There should no ability to copyright any piece of generated content unless whoever is attempting to do so can verify they own the copyright to every single piece of material used to produce or &quot;train&quot; the model. These generative models are not capable of creativity and are effectively no different from a calculator - provided the same input, they will produce the same output. If an entity cannot demonstrate that they own the copyright to all of the inputs, then they should not be permitted to profit off stealing the labors of others by copyrighting the output.
