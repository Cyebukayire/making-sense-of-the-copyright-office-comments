AI or the incomplete Artificial Intelligence and its abuse is not a good resource nor is it ethical to use. It abused the creative works of real human beings and claims them for their own, attributing them to another &quot;author&quot; or &quot;creator&quot; or &quot;artist&quot; that had no hand in the process. It&#39;s awful and steals the work of other, and is used improperly by its audience. AI cannot be copyrighted, either. It is a huge conglomerate of stolen works that formally recognizing each resource would be near impossible, especially if its resource is the limitless expanse of the internet.<br/>AI abuses the hard work of others to create a cheap party trick that evil enterprisors use to exploit those that contributed.
