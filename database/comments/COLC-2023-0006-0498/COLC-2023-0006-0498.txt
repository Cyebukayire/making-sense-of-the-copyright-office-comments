I work in a creative industry; I own a business doing licensed merchandise for brands in IPs. Daily, I work with creators to make physical manifestations of what they drew. I think that AI creations in general have the potential to be incredible resources. The problem is the people making, generating, and selling these systems are predators seeking to profit off the work of everyone else without paying them.  We cannot allow these people to steal and have them think it&#39;s okay. My artists&#39; artwork has been stolen, and it is being used to line the pockets of some of the most unethical people who are using a guise of &quot;quirky artist/tech disruptor&quot; to distract from the fact they are STEALING. <br/><br/>Nothing should be acceptable for copyright or claiming when they did not CREATE IT THEMSELVES and especially when it&#39;s using predatory systems that steal the work of others. If these systems were used as a resource and their generation came from compensated (or at the very least, voluntary contribution) work, and a human hand generated the supplemental extra parts necessary, absolutely! That is something worth defending and owning. But not theft.
