Copyright exists to encourage artistic innovation by giving artists the exclusive rights to their works. Granting copyright to AI generated works could never increase artistic innovation because there is zero opportunity cost for an AI. What would take months for a human takes under a second for AI. Therefore, there is a need to protect the human&rsquo;s work that does not exist for AI. Even without copyright, AI works will completely saturate life. It is unnecessary and potentially harmful to protect it more.
