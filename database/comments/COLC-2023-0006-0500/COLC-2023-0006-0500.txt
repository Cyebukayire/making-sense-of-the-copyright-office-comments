I think that &quot;AI&quot; generated works (LLMs, etc.) should not be able to be copyrighted as they are not creative endeavours anymore than using Google Image Search is.<br/>I additionally think that any such generators that are trained on copyrighted works (Including people&#39;s likenesses and other distinctive traits) without the owner&#39;s express and explicit written consent should be considered to be infringing copyright, as they are attempting to reproduce works, potentially for sale or other commercial use, without the express permission of the copyright holder. Furthermore, any copyrightable data that was obtained under false premises and is used in a generated work should result in that work being ineligible for copyright.<br/>I believe that this technology is one not ready for use by the general public responsibly as it is ripe for misuse, abuse, and has the capacity to harm many creative and practical industries while adding little value except to the pockets of the already obscenely wealthy. I do recognize that addressing this concern is beyond the needs of the Copyright Office, however I do request the office adopt strict measures to prevent derivative and stolen frankenstein works from becoming the next get rich quick scheme for people who do not have copyright&#39;s best interests at heart.
