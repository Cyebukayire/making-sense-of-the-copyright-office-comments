When it comes to using copyrighted material, AI should only be allowed to learn from it if the creators of the AI and the creators of the copyrighted material have an explicit contract detailing exactly how the AI can use the material. As it stands now, there is no AI that has such contracts. Furthermore, AI has been stealing content from not only companies, but individuals as well, profitting off of work that it can take no claim to. If an AI generates something using copyrighted material, that new content should not be allowed to be copyrighted, or even sold or used to generate revenue in any capacity, as this would violate the copyright of the original source. AI currently has no capability to create original content without first learning from a human source. If the creators of an AI wish to copyright the AI&#39;s generated content, they would need to purge all its existing knowledge and have it learn from people who have agreed to allow their work/words/voices to be used for the purpose of training the AI. In such a case it would be necessary to ensure that the people involved in the training are fairly compensated as the owners of the AI could potentially earn revenue from its content into perpetuity.
