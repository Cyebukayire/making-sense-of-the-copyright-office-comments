As both an artist and a writer, I live in fear that my personal brand of content and ability to make a living off my art and writing is inherently threatened by the fact that any random individual or organization can plug my works into an AI and have it spit out cheap approximations. There needs to be federal protections for artists, writers, voice actors and all others affected so that consent must be granted by the creator in order to have their content (drawn, written, voiced, etc) used by AI. This must be complete with legal recourse for those who go out of their way to bypass the consent-giving process. AI generated content may single-handedly kill many creative&rsquo;s drives to produce any work at all, and beyond that, kill their livelihoods or risk their future careers. Please, listen to the creatives who are begging you to protect them, and add legal protections against the blatant theft of creative content that is rampant among AI users today. Thank you.
