Allowing works that are produced by AI to be copyrighted effectively opens the door to encouraging and rewarding indentured slavery.<br/><br/>How will AI produced works be certified as genuinely produced by AI, versus an indentured enslaved human? Currently there is no way to ensure that the work was created by AI and not created by a person.<br/><br/>Copyright laws were created to protect the creators of works from exploitation via the violation of the creator&#39;s copyright. If AI is the creator, creating the work that can be copyrighted, the creator is the AI, not the programming human who wrote the AI&#39;s programming code. Just as father and mother who created the child, are not entitled to the copyright of their child&#39;s creation.<br/><br/>Not only must AI produced work not be copyrighted, it must be watermarked as an AI creation, and completely prohibited from any for-fee or other compensation for it&#39;s commercial use.<br/><br/>Alternatively, now that AI created works have proven to be comparable to human created works, one option is to do away with the entire concept of anyone owning a copyright for any work they create. This would effectively put all works created by humans or AI into the public domain, where it can be freely used without copyright to benefit mankind.<br/><br/>If AI created works are copyrighted, it will very quickly (is already doing it) surpass the works created by humans, thereby diminishing the inherent and commercial value of works created by humans.<br/><br/>&quot;Why should I pay $6 million for a Picasso, when I can have my AI paint me a much better one?&quot;
