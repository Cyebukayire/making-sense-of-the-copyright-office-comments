Generative AI is by definition trained on the already existing and copyrighted works of real humans, usually without permission, and plagiarizes the work of those people to spew out a cheap, soulless imitation. These plagiarism softwares must be built in an exploitative manner to be profitable and therefore it&#39;s unacceptable to use them to further generate profit on the back of stolen work while taking away opportunities from real humans to perform their jobs. It shouldn&#39;t be legal to copyright works created with generative AI because they&#39;re all the laziest form of plagiarism.
