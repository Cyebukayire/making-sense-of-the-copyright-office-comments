Allowing copyright protection to works created via generative AI is unreasonable for the following reasons:<br/>* Court opinions have repeatedly held that works not created by humans cannot be copyrighted<br/>* Works created via generative AI are arguably already infringing by nature of how training data was compiled<br/>* The ease of rapidly generating works, and the simplicity of automating this process, introduces a novel risk to our copyright system: copyright trolls. Equivalent behavior in our patent system (though obviously without generative AI) has stifled innovation and imposed excess costs on those who actually produce works that will be used, versus those who want to rent-seek on an idea they had no intention or ability to follow through on. With generative AI, an entity could feasibly produce a massive range of copyrightable work spanning numerous variations on a theme (or set of themes), host them on an obscure corner of the internet, and abuse copyright law to extract payment from any actual artist who, through their own creativity, creates a work that is similar to one created en masse via automation. This would impose extreme risk and costs on those working in creative fields, while allowing those who otherwise contribute nothing to leech off of their work. We have already seen how intellectual property rights are abused by bad actors - please don&#39;t repeat the mistakes of the patent office.
