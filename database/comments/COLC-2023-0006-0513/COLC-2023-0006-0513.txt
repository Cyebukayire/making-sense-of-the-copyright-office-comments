I am a professional writer. While I think generative AI can be incredibly useful for my profession, it is built on stolen work. I believe it is unethical to use work when the creators were not asked permission or compensated for it. I also believe that while AI can be a great tool for generating ideas, assisting those with disabilities in writing, researching (once the frequency of &quot;hallucinations&quot; is brought below an acceptable threshold), and revising, I believe that there&#39;s a limit. AI used as a writing tool is incredibly valuable; AI used to create more than half of a story is not amplifying creativity, but suffocating it. I also believe that readers deserve to know when AI is used, even if in the early stages of generating ideas. Readers should have the option to skip AI-generated content if they don&#39;t want to support it.
