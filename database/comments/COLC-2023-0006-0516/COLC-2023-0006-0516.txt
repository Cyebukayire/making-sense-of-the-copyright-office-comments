I don&rsquo;t believe that the purposes do copyright law are consistent with protecting AI generated content, even if that content is then modified in some way by a human as a loophole. This is destructive to the arts rather than in service to the arts. I also think it would be incorrect to allow the use of copyrighted work to train AI, as I think there are real issues of plagiarism involved. AI doesn&rsquo;t learn, it copies. I think we need to be very careful about protecting the work of writers and artists, particularly in the context of AI.
