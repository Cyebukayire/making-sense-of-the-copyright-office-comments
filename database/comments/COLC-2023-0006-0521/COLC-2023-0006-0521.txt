I&#39;m a professional, award-winning fiction writer who is actively publishing and able to live off my writing. Many of the LLMs used to train AI include pirated (stolen) text from copyrighted works -- work that artists spent years producing, after decades of honing their artistic skills.  Open AI and other AI corporations did not actually steal the work, but they do not currently permit authors to opt out of their datasets and they do not exclude copyrighted works. They are thus poised to make billions of dollars in profit off stolen goods and labor. What incentive is there for me, as an author, to continue producing work under those circumstances? I make art because I love doing so, but I publish that art so I can make a living. If my work is just going to get stolen, and if some company&#39;s shareholders are going to get the benefit of my labor and skill without compensating me, I see no reason to continue sharing my work with the public -- and a lot of other artists will make the same choice. Unregulated, I believe AI will decimate American art.<br/><br/>AI companies should not be permitted to violate artists&#39; copyright against their will, uncredited, and uncompensated.
