Copyright should never be granted to a machine. Copyright should only be granted to a person. This is because a machine is not a conscious entity- Only conscious entities can be considered creative. To be creative, an entity must be consciously aware of the subject matter of the creative activity. Without conscious awareness, there isn&#39;t actual creativity- There&#39;s only programming that produce the mere superficial appearance of creativity.
