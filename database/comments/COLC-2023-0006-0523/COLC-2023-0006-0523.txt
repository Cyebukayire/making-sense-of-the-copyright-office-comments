Companies, organizations, and individuals should not be allowed to violate the copyrights of others when generating AI models. This would include prohibition of scraping the public internet at large, since the vast majority of that content is protected under copyright. <br/><br/>Companies, organizations and individuals who use AI to generate content, and then make no substantive transformative changes to that content, should not be granted copyright of that work. The threshold for this test should be strict; minor modification or watermarking or adding a signature should not be sufficient.<br/><br/>Violations of copyright in either the training or use of AI models must lie with the company, organization or individual conducting the operation. If a company violates copyright by training a model on copyrighted data without a license, the company holds responsibility there. If a company, organization, or individual uses a model trained on copyrighted data without a license, they are responsible. Thus, it would behove users of AI to either train the models themselves on known-safe materials, or insist on indemnification by the tool&#39;s producers.<br/><br/>AI does not operate in a vacuum. It is created and used by companies, organizations, and individuals. And when those companies, organizations and individuals violate copyright, they must be held responsible for those violations.
