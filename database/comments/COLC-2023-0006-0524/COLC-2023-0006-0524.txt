In my personal opinion, it is a matter of what the AI was trained on. Unfortunately most AI generative services such as midjourney were trained on art found online without the consent of the artist. In such cases, the art should not be allowed to hold copyright ownership by anyone, If the AI tool is trained on data owned by the user/developer of the tool, then I think it&#39;s fair and the owner should have the copyright.
