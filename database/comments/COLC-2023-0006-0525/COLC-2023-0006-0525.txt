AI in nearly all of its forms should not be allowed to maintain any kind of copyright over any created work. I am of the opinion that only humans directly involved in the creation of a work should be entitled to hold any form of ownership of said work until it enters public domain. AI offsets the humans in the process of creation, and therefore it, and the humans who used the AI to &quot;create&quot;, are not entitled to any ownership. This is not even getting into the issue of how most AI is scraping, literally stealing, the works of others. It is immoral and terrible to let the practice continue, let alone reward its use.
