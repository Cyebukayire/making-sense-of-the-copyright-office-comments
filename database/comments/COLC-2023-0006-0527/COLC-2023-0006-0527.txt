I think the use of A.I. is absolutely abhorrent. There is nothing ethical about the current usage of it. All of these models are primarily trained on material without the consent of the original artists. I think with no regulations on how A.I. proceeds the future will be very bleak and not just for creatives. The use of A.I. is being used to cut corners, limit working opportunities and it will be the rapid downfall for the working class and society - pushing us further into a gap between classes and economical struggles.
