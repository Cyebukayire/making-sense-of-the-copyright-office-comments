I think that, as a protection for artistic works, copyright should only be granted to works of art made by humans. AI and machine learning does not create or make art. It can only copy based on art that already exists. I think fully AI-created works, as well as ones with the intent to be initially made by AI and then merely &ldquo;touched up&rdquo; or &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; by human hands to give the illusion of humanity, should not receive copyright protection in any way. People are more important than things, and humans are more important than machines. Don&rsquo;t treat one like the other.
