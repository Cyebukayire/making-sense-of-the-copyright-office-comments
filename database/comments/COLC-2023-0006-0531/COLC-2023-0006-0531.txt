AI in its current form cannot be compared to the very human phenomenon called inspiration. It is a complex learning model, and a technological marvel, but it is also a model that functions exclusively by making mosaics of preexisting data.<br/><br/>Current AI models copy and paste and rearrange already existing data, which is often fed into the AI without consent or even the knowledge of the original artists. Furthermore, it does not have any functionality included to reliably and consistently cite its sources.<br/><br/>Being incapable of making spontaneous decisions and generating new information, as well as being incapable of citing the sources of the information it makes its composites from, makes AI in its current form unambiguously plagiarism. It uses unethically sourced data (in all media forms, including but not limited to written works, visual works, and audio files) to mimic the generation of new compositions without giving credit to the humans who made the data from which it thrives. This would be unacceptable behavior from a human or a company, and should not be tolerated from machines or machine learning either.
