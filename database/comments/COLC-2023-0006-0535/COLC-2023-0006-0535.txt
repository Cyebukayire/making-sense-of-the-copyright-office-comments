I find the use of artificial intelligence as is a disgusting theft of personal or professional creations. Outside of very specific instances, artificial intelligence programs/data sets/etc. are built using private individual&#39;s or professional work data that has been stolen to build data sets. The stolen data is not credited to the individual it was taken from, and the original owner/creator of the scraped data is not compensated for their contribution. There is no way to opt out of having your data utilized in these data sets beyond good Samaritan actions of some unaffiliated programmers, and AI is now being integrated into professional programs used for work that may be under a nondisclosure agreement, or other such contract requiring the data generated to not pass beyond the creator and commissioner. My best examples are in art or visual generating programs such as Adobe Illustrator, but it is likely that this would spread to programs for generating blueprints and other visual data, if it hasn&#39;t already. The way data was collected and abused by these AI companies is exploitative and gross negligence of intellectual property.
