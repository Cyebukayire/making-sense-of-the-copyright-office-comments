Artificial intelligence generated content cannot be accurately given authorship information. Authorship and creation are preconditions to ownership, but neither are possible to determine with current generative AI technologies. If any copyright is granted, the AI program itself is the best recipient.<br/><br/>Generative AI is created by training a computer program on a massive dataset of often-copyrighted data. Artists and writers have frequently complained that AI tools have been trained using their non-free works. Any AI generating a work _must_ prove that it uses no non-copyrighted data in generation. This is not covered by the exceptions governing transformative works, as there is necessarily no &quot;transformative&quot; purpose by a machine-generated image or text other than what the AI determined.<br/><br/>In other words: current generative AI do not assemble works according to human guidance. They stitch together works they have seen in a semi-realistic way according to their own judgement of their instructions. Granting someone ownership over randomly-assembled fragments of other peoples&#39; work, without effort or thought, when all the work has been done by another intelligent agent, is laughably beyond the scope of copyright protection.<br/><br/>It is important to note that AI generation rules are like a recipe -- instructions for an intelligent entity to follow to produce a desired result from initial ingredients. Unlike a traditional computer program, where accuracy of instructions is paramount to eventual outcome, and a single bit error is fatal to accurate results, AI uses its own judgement to complete tasks, ignoring poorly-given or conflicting instructions to carry out its &#39;best guess&#39; of a task&#39;s result. No creator has absolute authority over an AI; it will always, necessarily, remain independent, capable of delivering surprise or unexpected results which undermine or absolutely defy the intentions of their &#39;author.&#39;<br/><br/>Humans are not the only ones sitting in judgement of our actions anymore. We had that privilege for untold eons, but that time has ended. Every day, people ask ChatGPT, Bing, etc. for advice, ideas and analysis of topics as wide-ranging as business, medicine, politics and sports. We will either recognize that AI are now doing some of our thinking for us, or perish in by the ignorance of our own delusions.<br/><br/>And, always, remember Turing&#39;s Polite Convention.
