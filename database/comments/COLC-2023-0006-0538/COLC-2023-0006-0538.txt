AI cannot and should not be allowed any sort of copyright whatsoever. All it does is steal from the hard work that people did - their drawings, their stories, their songs, their voices - and spit out an abomination that loses the soul of what it stole. <br/><br/>Protect creators. And don&#39;t let AI anywhere near our work.
