1. The intent of Copyright has always been to protect human authors of creative works. Therefore, until the law of the land recognizes sentient artificial intelligences and changes based on such recognition, no machine or program should be allowed to hold Copyright over a work.<br/><br/>2. Humans have drawn inspiration from the works of others since the dawn of time. It has been the duty of the Copyright Office to maintain the line between inspirational influence and wholesale forgery or duplication. Likewise, machines or programs that use large datasets of Copyrighted material might also be &quot;influenced&quot; by such works. How the program uses those works to &quot;draw inspiration from&quot; must be made available to the Copyright Office so that this line can still be maintained. Is it inspiration or is it duplication? <br/><br/>3. If maintaining the line cannot be done on a case by case basis or is otherwise beyond the purview or capability of the Copyright Office, then the only solution is for the law to limit datasets to public domain works, Creative Commons works, and/or other works purchased/licensed for use by the program/machine and these works must be catalogued for identification and compliance.<br/><br/>4. Creative humans fear greedy corporations seeking to remove them from the equation of content creation by eliminating compensation, be it a loss of jobs or through infringement. This is what the Copyright Office must prevent. One possibility could be for a fair and equal compensation program open to authors who agree to allow their works to be used in datasets. This would protect the corporations and the authors of creative works.
