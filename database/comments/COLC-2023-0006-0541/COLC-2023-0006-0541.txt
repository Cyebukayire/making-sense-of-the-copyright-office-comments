I strongly oppose this. I am a writer who sees that AI does nothing but imitate the work of myself and others and passes for acceptable. Companies within the creative arts and marketing will see this as a cost-cutting measure, but all it does is rip off artists who should be paid fairly for our work. Instead, it will kill the arts, while companies looking to save money will use it and accept the poor quality that imitates the real work done by humans for years. <br/><br/>AI is plagiarism. Simple as that. AI should be seen as copyright infringement. There is no place for it in the artistic or marketing world. It is a danger to jobs.
