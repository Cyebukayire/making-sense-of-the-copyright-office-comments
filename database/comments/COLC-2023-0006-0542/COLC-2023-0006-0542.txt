Unlike historical art-related technological innovations such as photography, AI depends entirely on existing input from actual creators. It can only be trained with a constant fresh influx of real art, and thus far much of that input has been achieved through simple theft.<br/>For these reasons, I believe AI should be rigorously controlled, clearly labelled as AI when used, and disqualified from copyright-ability.
