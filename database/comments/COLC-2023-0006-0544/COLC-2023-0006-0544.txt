AI generated content, especially that which uses the internet at large or existing IP, is at best an interesting thought experiment. It cannot create something from nothing and is therefore constantly pulling, arguably stealing, from existing content. Any claim that the content created by an artificial intelligence us of the same value as ANYTHING made by a human being is an insult to the intelligence and integrity of artists, writers, engineers, teachers, and all other persons who create meaningful works in society.
