There is an urgent need to create and implement clear and thorough rules and regulation for AI. There are already a number of lawsuits making their way through the courts contesting the legality of what several AI developers did re: using copyrighted material without permission, compensation, or even informing the copyright holders; and then using the AI they had developed using that copyrighted material, attempting to make profit. There must be clear regulations to prevent these kind of copyright violations from happening. AI companies took advantage of the fact that there were no specific regulations addressing their brand new technology&mdash;although the previously mentioned slate of lawsuits will decide if they did break copyright law&mdash;and must be prevented from doing so again.
