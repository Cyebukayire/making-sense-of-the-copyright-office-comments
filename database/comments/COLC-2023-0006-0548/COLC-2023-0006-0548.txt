All AI does is make my creative friends feel like giving up because they have no way to compete. And the only way they CAN compete is to try and put out more content, which would all get scooped up by AI against their will to train it to make something that has no heart and soul behind it. I have no doubt AI can be an incredible tool, but the way it&#39;s being used is unacceptable.<br/><br/>I&#39;m not the smartest person in the world, but it doesn&#39;t take a smart person to see when their friends are scared shitless about losing their livelihoods to a robot. Creators already have it hard enough. We don&#39;t need to make it harder. <br/><br/>
