I am an American citizen who has have written content published for readership and I am deeply concerned with the direction of the use for AI in creative works and in labor fields. I strongly am AGAINST the use of AI for creative works, and am deeply troubled with how various entertainment industries are teasing the idea of using AI generated content over the use of human creativity. Also, I am exceedingly frustrated, and outraged that other authors, and aritsts, have had their copyrighted works USED to train AI without their permission. The trained AI then is able to mimic their style of writing or art thus reproducing their copyrighted material without the original human creator&#39;s consent or permission, sometimes the AI generated content is sold for profit and no proceeds are given to the original copyright holder. This is outrageous and the use of AI in creative fields, in entertainment fields, must be restricted and heavily regulated with extreme prejudice. I implore and ask the regulations and powers that be to enforce heavy regulations and favor humanity and our creativity.
