Generative AI must be trained on millions of works.  The chances of them being trained only on non-copyrighted works is extremely small.  It is not difficult to create an exact replica of a copyrighted work, given the correct prompt.  However, the original copyright holder was never informed their work was used to train the gAI, and the gAI user is not informed that the work in question is a replica of a copyrighted work.  Users of gAI will unintentionally create infringing works as long as gAI is trained on copyrighted data.<br/><br/>It should be obvious that copyrighting an already copyrighted work is not possible.  Because gAI can generate exact replicas of anything it was trained on, it should clearly not be allowed to copyright any material it creates.  After the training is complete, there is no way to know if the results of a prompt are exact copies of a copyrighted work, and thus should be uncopyrightable.<br/><br/>gAI systems must be held accountable for infringing on copyrighted works.  These companies are already making a profit, based largely on others copyrighted works, which should be clearly illegal.  gAI systems train on copyrighted works, and then provide a paid service which can provide exact replicas of copyrighted works, without compensating the owner of the original copyrighted work.<br/><br/>gAI outputs that intentionally mimic the identity or style of a human artist, by definition, must have been trained on that human artist&#39;s work.  If they did so without permission, which is likely, they should be ruled as in violation of the human artist&#39;s copyright.<br/><br/>Companies that created gAI did so by using artists hard work, and now are trying to replace those artists.  These companies are trying to justify their profiting off other people&#39;s work, and it&#39;s as simple as that.  They used copyrighted works without permission, and are profiting off the result.  I urge you not to allow this to go on.  Artists are losing their livelihoods because gAI can replace them, after gAI stole their work in the first place.
