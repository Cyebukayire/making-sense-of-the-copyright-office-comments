I think it should be assumed that all copyrighted work is protected from use in artificial intelligence. Perhaps a license (akin to creative commons licensing) could be available on an opt-in system (i.e. opt-in, NOT automatic or opt-out) for use in artificial intelligence projects. Published AI works using such &quot;creative commons&quot; works should be under legal obligation to disclose/credit/cite the works which contributed to their artificial intelligence generated project.
