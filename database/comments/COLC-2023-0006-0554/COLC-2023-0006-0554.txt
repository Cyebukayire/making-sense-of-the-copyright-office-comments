Article 1, section 8 of the United States Constitution states that &ldquo;Congress shall have power&hellip; to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Intellectual property rights law is still a developing area. It seems extremely likely to me that copyright is violated by the currently common use of copyrighted material in training without notifying copyright holders, let alone seeking their permission or making agreed-to payment. Assigning copyright to material produced by AI seems like assigning ownership of gaming winnings to a set of dice, and equally obviously, it is unclear how an AI engine can be held responsible for tortious publication.<br/><br/>What I really want to talk about, though, is what role freeing use of AI to shake and eternally rebake pre-existing materials would impede the progress of science and useful arts. <br/><br/>Progress inherently involves change. In the sciences and all arts, much useful production involves grinding through application and implications of pre-existing paradigms, and that production is important. But true progress requires rethinking, fresh observation, reconceptualization, and intuition, which are human attributes that cutting and pasting cannot achieve. In order to promote the progress of science and usual arts, our society needs knowledgeable and talented workers saying &ldquo;But what about&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Now, wait a minute&mdash;&ldquo;. <br/><br/>It is already clear that the owners and managers of large firms are eager to turn from employing and paying human beings to production by machinery they can own and need not pay. They are so eager that they are claiming much more facile productivity for AI than exists or is likely to exist any time soon&mdash;and I think they aren&rsquo;t just using this phantasm as a threat to labor, but that they believe it. <br/><br/>What they propose is some combination of firing most employees and employing some for sweated labor cleaning up the ungainly, irrational, and inherently non-creative remixes produced by their AI&mdash;in the case of texts, requiring writing but calling it copyediting.<br/><br/>Who will train for such jobs? Not people with much in the way of alternatives. <br/><br/>And without creative and trained humans, we will be unable to rethink existing problem better, let alone meet new challenges.<br/><br/>Just fancy if, for instance, the world had been unable to turn from Ptolemaic epicycles to a heliocentric model of the universe. If medicine had continued to center the humors and never conceived a germ theory of infection. Even if all cartoons were Steamboat Willie.<br/><br/>We already know what it&rsquo;s like when movie moguls decide that every new film should be a rehash within some franchise, following the Joe Bob Briggs principal that a sequel should be making the same damn movie again. And with what relief innovative new voices&mdash;currently typically from independents&mdash;sound forth and are received.<br/><br/>I am a writer and have been a teacher. There is already far too much belief, in the US, that new non-fiction is simply a cut-and-paste of previous publications, that what schools teach isn&rsquo;t enquiry and communication but recitation.<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t license the kind of deadening impetus on creativity and progress that would be unleashed by empowering AI owners to disrespect the rights, works, and powers of labor.<br/>
