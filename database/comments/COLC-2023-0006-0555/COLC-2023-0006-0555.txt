The use of AI to take the jobs of Americans or to steal the likeness of people is a threat to human connection. I like talking to a breathing Customer Service rep. I like reading a book and script written by an author who has had real life experiences. I like watching actors interact on screen in nuanced ways that AI could never recreate. We are slowly losing our connections with other human beings. I don&rsquo;t want my community to be artificial intelligence.
