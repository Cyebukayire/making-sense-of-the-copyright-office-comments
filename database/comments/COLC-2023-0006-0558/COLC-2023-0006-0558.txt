Content created by so-called artificial intelligence has no artistic merit or value and should not be eligible for copyright. In fact, generative AI software itself violates copyright by sampling existing works without the original human creators&rsquo; permission to spit out a product. Because of how it works and its parasitic relationship to the creative works of human artists, AI-generated content should be viewed as a type of plagiarism or counterfeit. Anyone who relies on AI software to create a product for them is not a writer or artist but a user of a program, an immoral and soulless program that threatens the livelihood of working Americans.
