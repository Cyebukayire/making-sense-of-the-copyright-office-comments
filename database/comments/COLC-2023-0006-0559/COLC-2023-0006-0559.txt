As a citizen of the United States of America, I feel that the use of AI in any form of music or art should be counted as a form of copyright infringement. AI systems pull from existing material to generate unauthentic mixtures that I feel may damage artists, organizations, and career fields. The rise of AI music and AI voiceovers from various celebrities and musical artists can negatively affect reputations and give someone profit by using another celebrity&#39;s work without their permission, which violates copyright laws.
