The very concept of AI is intelligence that is derivative of other peoples information and information. I have have my work used to train AI systems in Hollywood without my consent and receive no payment or acknowledgment. AI doesn&#39;t belong anywhere near anything that requires a copyright and companies that intend to use it that way seem to be walking a very thin line. I work in Hollywood as a writer director and AI is at the very forefront of the writer and actors strike currently taking place now. We need congress to act to offer better protections for artists everywhere. No to AI.
