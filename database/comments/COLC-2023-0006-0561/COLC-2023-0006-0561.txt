I do not want anything that is created by AI to be copyrightable, be them books, photos, videos, movies, articles, anything of the sort. AI doesn&#39;t create. It merely scans and skims created works and then recombines them. It can&#39;t create original work, and therefore it shouldn&#39;t be eligible for copyright.
