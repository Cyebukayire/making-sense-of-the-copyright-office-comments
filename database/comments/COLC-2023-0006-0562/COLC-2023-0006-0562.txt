Because &quot;AI&quot; generated work is entirely the product of largely illegally plagiarized and stolen data sets, and because &quot;AI&quot; is not in fact actually creative, &quot;AI&quot; derived works should not be Copyright-able, Patent-able, Trademark-able, or otherwise register-able for any legal protection.  Additionally, I feel that any corporation or individual using &quot;AI&quot; generate pap for any commercial application should be required to PROVE that the data set contains NO Stolen, plagiarized, or otherwise illegally obtained data. Theft of IP by large corporations from individuals should be treated exactly as theft of IP from corporations by individuals.  By which I mean that if someone like Disney or Warner Bros uses AI to steal/plagiarize the work of an independent artist, they should struck with a ruinously large fine that hurts them as badly as the typical statutory fines would hurt a normal individual.
