This is actually quite simple.  1) generative ai infringes on copyrights and trademarks held by others by using it in their training data without permission.  This should be enforced and only allowed with permission by the original IP holders.  Any work derrived from AI using illegal training data is therefore also an infringing work.  2) ai generated content should not be able to be copyrighted since it&#39;s nit generated by a human.  Human generated prompts are at beat equivalent to project requirements from an editor or an art supervisor, and not sufficient to copyright an AI generated work.  If a human created it with the same prompts or directions it would be the human creator who copyrighted the work,  not the prompt giver.
