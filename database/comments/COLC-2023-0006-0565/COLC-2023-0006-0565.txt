A.I has its place in specific scenarios, i wont pretend it doesnt. It has the potential to help with so many situations.<br/><br/>However the state of AI as it is now is nothing but a tool to steal everything and everything and use it to build something from stolen parts. <br/>If you built a car, and each piece of it was stolen from a person and there specific car, that car is made up of illegally acquired parts and it is illegal all in itself. <br/><br/>AI steals so many different things from people ranging from there artistic talents, to their looks, and even their voices.<br/><br/>This opens up SO many legal issues and problems including the inability for major businesses to copyright any of their work if it involves AI, as well as legal actions against businesses that could lead to large financial Fees. <br/><br/>the only way AI should exist is an OPTIONAL opt in choice and any person found using works for AI illegally needs to be faced with legal actions
