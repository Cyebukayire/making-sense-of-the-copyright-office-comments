At the time of writing, what we call AI is actual just a generator that creates images, words, or other types of media by being given a prompt and then constructing something based on that prompt by searching a database of available information involving that prompt. By definition, it can currently only create media based off media that it has been given access to. This on its own isn&rsquo;t an issue and is quite interesting from a technical standpoint. However, the databases from which these AIs pull are filled with media collected from various internet sources without credit given to the original source. There has been many cases of AI image generators copying artists&rsquo; work, up to and including their watermarks, without the consent of said artists. If a person uses AI that has been trained on artwork taken without permission to generate an image and then that person then seeks to distribute and profit from that image, is that not a violation of intellectual property? Maybe it could be said that by uploading their artwork onto the internet, the artist signs away the rights to their artwork, but what if someone unaffiliated with the artist were to post the artwork without the artist&rsquo;s permission? The AI cannot tell the difference between something posted with the artist&rsquo;s permission and something posted without permission. The only way to prevent the AI from using the latter would be to specifically curate the database to ensure all data within is used with permission which would be a herculean task to perform when only pulling data from a single source, let alone  as many sources as it currently does. There will be cases where even a well-curated database will use media to train the AI without the permission of the owner of said media and if the owner learns of this, they will likely sue to get their property removed from the database.
