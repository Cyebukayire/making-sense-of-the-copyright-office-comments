AI is a direct breach of copyright law. It samples from existing content created by real human beings without offering them proper credit or compensation. Even if it was an ethical endeavor, though, the information generated by AI bots can easily be manipulated to be incorrect. At best, this serves as an annoyance to anyone attempting to use an AI service, but, at worst, it could lead to death. For example, someone reading a wilderness survival book generated by AI may find out the hard way that the mushrooms and berries recommended in said book are not only toxic but fatal. We need to strengthen our copyright laws and limit or utterly remove the use of AI to prevent creators from being swindled and save the general public from misinformation.
