As an artist the rise of AI generated &quot;artworks&quot; has been greatly troubling as there&#39;s no regulations surrounding what the AI is fed, leading the learning algorithm to take works taken by unconsenting parties (typically artists, writers, voice actors, musicians), and producing media that infringes upon their rights as producers and their claims to their work by the AI mixing the various forms of art with other &quot;found&quot; parts to produce something that&#39;s just a collage of a piece of work; the user of this AI, who has done NONE of the work or creative thinking behind it then claims it to be transformative, and that they can sell it and make profit off of others.<br/> In example, if you created a piece of artwork and uploaded it to a social media site, that artwork will be eventually &#39;scraped&#39; by an AI or company to feed an AI, and use it without your consent. That piece of artwork can be merged with something else, or simply just slightly altered and resold or redistributed without consulting the original creator. That is theft in my eyes, that is taking something humans have spent years, centuries even, cultivating and giving to the community or making their livelihoods off of and making it a bastardization of itself for quick profit. It&#39;s, in my words, abhorrent. <br/>We need regulations, and we need them soon. We need production least the creation of original works of art comes to a stand still, and we are left with the same garbled mess of work of the AI feeding off of itself, gradually losing quality and any sense of identity it MAY have had.
