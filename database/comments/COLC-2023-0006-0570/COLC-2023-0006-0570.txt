There is no justifiable way to claim AI generated work is anything other than theft in it&#39;s current form. It is built and &quot;taught&quot; on scraped artwork without the artists knowledge, consent, or compensation. Separate from all the other issues I have with the way that these tools are used, the largest strike against them has to be that, how it wrongly steals from artists hard work to spit out a facsimile of what an artist would do, to only have that be turned around and sold, even copy righted is an insult to every living person that&#39;s ever even had a creative thought. This is not a situation like photography ruffling feathers, this would be the equivalent of someone taking pictures of the Mona Lisa and claiming it entirely as their own work with the &quot;help&quot; of a camera.<br/><br/>The absolute bare minimum that would be conscious able would be to refuse any copy right on any and all work primarily using AI generated work. What is more reasonable, if not more daunting, would be a lawsuit against those that stole the artwork to train these AI programs to properly compensate everyone that they stole from, which I understand would largely be anyone that posted anything online at all at this point. Nothing less would send the proper message to these conmen and grifters. What they are doing is theft.
