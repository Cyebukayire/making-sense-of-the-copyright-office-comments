AI is, at its core, plagiarism. It is not what we&rsquo;ve been told. It isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;learning,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s pulling what it has been fed and spitting something out. Unchecked, AI will damage multiple creative fields and gives me great concern for its usage in the area of deep fakes. Regulations need to be made.
