I am writing in to ask the US Copyright Office to protect artwork, writing, voice performances, music, transformative works, and other creative work from companies that use AI generated programs. Content generated by AI programs is not art, it&#39;s an amalgamation of content that has been scraped from artists and writers that post their art and writing online. Usually without their knowledge or consent. These artists receive no compensation for their work. This is theft. An AI program is a collection of code, it cannot express itself creatively the way people do. There is no artistic or authorial intent behind it.<br/>Writers, artists, actors, musicians, and other creatives are people who practice their respective crafts both as forms of employment and as hobbyists. Their time and skill deserves to be respected, compensated, and protected.
