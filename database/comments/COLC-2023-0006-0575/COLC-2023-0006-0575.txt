AI generated images are theft. The art used to train these AI is stolen art, and the artists in question have not received compensation or credit, nor were they asked for consent. Any AI generated images crated by AI that cannot be proven to have only been trained using art appropriately purchased from consenting artists should be considered art theft. This is also the case for AI writing, which is always plagiarism.
