First, thanks for taking the public&rsquo;s temperature on this. I&rsquo;ll try to keep this short and sweet. In order for AI to exist at all, it needs data sets, and and those data sets are full of the uncredited/unpaid work of thousands and thousands of visual artists, writers and musicians. <br/><br/>And what will we get in return? Unimaginative art. Thousands  of unemployed artists. And a small subset of people who will make money hand over fist.<br/><br/>If a business wants to use an AI engine, they should get the permission of artists to be included in those data sets, and compensate them on a residual basis. Their data set should be open to the public and searchable so people can make sure they aren&rsquo;t in it. They should not include the work of dead artists without the permission of family. And they should never be able to copyright artwork that is more than 1/5th AI created.<br/><br/>The notion of suddenly leaving a swath of this countries workers unemployed is pretty gross. The future doesn&rsquo;t just happen to us. We decide the kind of future we want to live in. We decide what kind of society we want to be.
