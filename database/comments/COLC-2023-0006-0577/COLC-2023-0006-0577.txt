To whom it may concern,<br/><br/>I am pleased the government is soliciting this feedback from the people of the United States regarding so-called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;. I will be as brief as I can with my concerns:<br/> - First, that so-called &quot;AI&quot; is over-hyped, to the point of the name entirely. I would be greatly relieved if elected officials ceased using this inaccurate term when referring to synthetic text engines, synthetic image generators, assistive driving technologies, and other limited technological applications that have gained facility in some forms of rapid input/output processing and natural language interface, but are nothing like actual &quot;intelligence&quot;.<br/> - Second, that creative enterprise in particular is targeted by synthetic text, image, and video production on two crucial fronts: human creatives have their work plagiarized by the data training of these synthetic generators, and then are threatened with being replaced by them.<br/><br/>I call on this government to recognize the unique and irreplaceable capabilities of human creativity, without which this so-called &quot;AI&quot; would have nothing to steal, and nothing to sell. <br/>To limit the allowed uses of automatic systems to those that can be tested to the most rigorous standards and challenged for bias and unintended consequences. <br/>And to redouble the security of the United States against over-reliance on private corporations like Amazon, Meta, X, Starlink, and their unproven technologies designed to move the market, not provide a stable, functioning world.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Ken Walter, Fairfield, CA
