I believe this issue requires careful considerations and a merging of both tech and non-tech domains (Tech + Law.)<br/>On the concern of whether AI-works can be copyrighted: <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>This should be weighed on the amount of human input required in the completion of the work. Since machines typically have predictable inputs and outputs, even if they may be random (and highly varied in the case of LLMs,) the same output or something that tells of the same ideas as exhibited in the copyrighted work is more likely.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Thus if a human did not place much input (beyond an initial prompt and a few prompt markers that &ldquo;nudged&rdquo; the AI towards a direction it was following,) copyright becomes more difficult.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If a human was an active and creative storyteller during the prompting process, it could be copyrighted on the grounds that significant time had gone into the creative process.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I believe this will create these two branches in exempt and non-exempt works, and this raises additional challenges for law in how exactly this content can be distinguished (or proven) in court. This will make keeping of transcripts with AI during the creatio of a work more important, similar to a manuscript that holds draft ideas of authors.<br/>On the issue of whether the works AI is trained on violate copyright:<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Lawyers and representatives must carefully understand (A) how the text is fed into the system and used, and (B) what happens to the text after it is fed into the system, and the ways it is processed.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>When AI is trained, the text is actually stored in a single file. That is, it is not meant for human consumption or redistribution of the content, as it is too large to open by standard text editing programs.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>While this does not mean a human cannot extract this information, it is not simple nor easy. Thus, it is meant to be read by the AI tools only that train with it and use it to assign weights in their neural programming vectors.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>This text is then scrambled and mapped by weights, and used directly in the learning process this way.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Publishing of the raw dataset for training is where this may still be an issue. AI companies should be limited to publishing of post-trained models (and ensuring they serve this format) &ndash; as this limits the risk of AI datasets being used to extract pirated copies of book content.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>However, the way in which AI is using this data falls under non-infringing fair use, as proven by the points above. Further expounding on these points with more technical data would be needed by AI companies if more context is required.<br/>Thank you for reading and considering these points.
