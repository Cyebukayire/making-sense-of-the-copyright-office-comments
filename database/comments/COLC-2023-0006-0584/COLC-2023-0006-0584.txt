As a performer, AI models have been built on the stolen biometric and personal ID data of myself and my colleagues. It CANNOT be allowed to be copywritten. Let this stand as one comment of the many that wholeheartedly refutes the notion that AI should have any legal protection or any other form of protection and support. Thank you for opening up this subject for public comment.
