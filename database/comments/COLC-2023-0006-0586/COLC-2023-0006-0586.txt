From what i can tell, most AI are infringing copyright on art and writing made and posted on the internet. While they show that it would be important for the tool, they have yet to show compensation to the copyright holders and some will claim it to be original work, while the produced work is often nearly identical to what it derives from, which should be seen as plagiarism<br/><br/>In scientific fields where pattern recognition is important, such as folding proteins and emergent behavior of groups of animals, the data is often acquired by the teams working on the project and the use of ai is a tool for a further understanding of natural systems that would be more complicated to simulate alone
