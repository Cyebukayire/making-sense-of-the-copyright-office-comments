<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Socially accepted plagiarism and theft - that is how I view current AI/ML models. Not once in school or in research have we been allowed to take research notes/paragraphs or even images without citing our source and properly crediting where we got the information. It has been a requirement for many years now that we create a bibliography, and in some cases ask for permission to use sources. Many times we purchase the rights to certain images/photography. AI models have stolen content without consent, and are setting a dangerous precedence for removing the human aspect of art and creation, as well as getting away with plagiarism, child p*rn, and misleading deepfakes. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Not once have these companies asked for our permission or consent. Consent is what makes us human, consent is a basic human right - it&rsquo;s one of the reasons we are different from animals, and these companies didn&rsquo;t even do that much. They just walked in and took what they wanted, and proceeded to give it to other people to use for their own gain and profit. Never once were we asked. This is not their skill in art, writing, voice acting, music, etc., it is stolen labor from the working class that is entirely propping up this new AI industry, and we&rsquo;re given less than table scraps for it. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>This cannot be the precedent set - they will learn that they can walk all over us and get away with it, these are our livelihoods, our identities, why do their profits matter more than our lives. The companies and the userbase did not earn the skill they are perceiving they have, they stole it from millions of hardworking people around the world who were never even told.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If plagiarism is not allowed when doing research papers or studies, it should not be allowed when it comes to mass data theft of artwork, writing, music, acting, etc. This data theft doesn&rsquo;t only affect these creative industries, the lack of restrictions on data scraping has led to a massive increase of child p*rn generations. If anyone had pictures of their children up on the internet in any way - it has likely been scraped and used for CP generations en masse. As well as including people who had their likeness taken and used for similar deepfakes. I hear often &quot;Plenty of people photoshop these images in the past anyway&quot; - yes, In significantly smaller amounts, and it is still frowned upon/seen as theft. Just because something wrong exists in such a way does not give the right to have it be wrong in a different way. Or on a larger scale.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Not allowing these generations to have copyright is at least a beginning barrier for partially halting this before it gets too far to be controlled, it gives real artists and creatives a reason to keep creating. These machines require the works of creatives, without us it leads to machine collapse. If creatives aren&rsquo;t given an incentive to keep going, the machines will not improve anymore because, despite being falsely labeled &ldquo;Artificial Intelligence&rdquo;, they are only machine learning, predictive models that CANNOT learn on their own, nor self-improve.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>This also helps dismantle the exhausting argument of the users that &ldquo;it learns the same as humans&rdquo;. It does not, most of us who do use photography or assets purchase them or find copyright-free versions on something akin to Pexels, or when we do studies we credit the artist we learned from. If you ask a human to draw a picture from a reference with no other knowledge, it will end up looking unique to them, if you ask the AI to draw a cat from a reference, it will spit out the exact same image. It needs us, and fails without us.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We at least need an incentive for the creatives to not give up, and not giving copyright to these generations is a start, because perhaps it will give way to a more ethical co-existence where creatives may even be inclined to help if it doesn&rsquo;t steamroll careers. Imagine how amazing these machines could be if they were helped along by artists and creators that do so WILLINGLY and figure out ways to build them to be better. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI has no story, it was never an addict, it never lost a loved one, it never went through rehab, it was never in a life-altering accident, it was never abused, it was never fired or laid off, it was never abandoned by a parent, it never struggled through life - but it does steal from the people who do - their voices, the way they chose to cope, and gave it to a userbase to use for their own profit and gain. <br/>
