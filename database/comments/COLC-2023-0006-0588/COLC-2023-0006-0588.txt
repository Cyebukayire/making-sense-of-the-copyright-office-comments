AI should not be copyrightable due to the fact that it needs to process already copyrighted material in order to function and is usually done so without proper permissions and as already exhibited by AI works already produced, are rarely given permission by the copyrighted sources they use and even in the instance where this is ok (it is not), they do not even credit wherein they trained their AI. In training their AI it is a compromise of morals as they steal from big corporations and small individuals alike with no recourse for their actions and should not benefit monetarily from their thievery. In preventing the monetary gain for AI-produced content, perhaps it will be used more responsibly and for its original purpose in making life easier for individuals rather than its current usage of scraping every inch it can of the internet for potential personal gain at the harm of many.
