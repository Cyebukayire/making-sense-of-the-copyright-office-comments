AI, as it stands today, has been trained on thoroughly compromised datasets, filled with stolen information that was neither compensated for, nor consented to by, the original creators. There is no way to fairly copyright AI generated pieces, whether word or image, due to the use of stolen copyrighted materials being used to create the works.
