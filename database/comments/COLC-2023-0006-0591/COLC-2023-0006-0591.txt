The AI software is literally plagiarism. It steals art and writing from people, squishes it together and then spits it out. It is effecting many people&#39;s livelihoods for the worst. Please make some severe regulations for this type of software. Maybe if the software could only dig up information from specific databases that all the writers and artists on it had specifically agreed to and been paid for.<br/><br/>If nothing is done about this plague then there might not be any new art or literature in the future. Only regurgitated garbage.
