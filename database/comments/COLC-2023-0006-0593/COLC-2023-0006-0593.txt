(1) the use of copyrighted works to train AI models;<br/>This would be considered copyright infringement, because a copy of training material or a derivative of the material is stored within the AI. The AI black box needs to be considered a collection of electronically stored material. Case law has already established that even the incident retention of an electronic copy of a work is an infringement. An AI owner may claim that because the material cannot be found or extracted for the AI algorithm it does not exist, this is a bit like saying an unorganized library contains no copyrighted work. If copyright material goes in (training) and is used by the AI (retained) because the AI is an electronic media (exists electronically) it is infringing. Again if a book is copied, even if the copy can&#39;t be recovered by the skill of the owner of the AI. The copy existed and in some form continues to exist. <br/><br/>(2) the copyrightability of material generated using AI systems; <br/>The output of a device is not copyrightablity. A machine created to randomly put notes together following music theory doesn&#39;t create a million songs, it creates a million permutations. Copyrights are not estibished to protect every possible combination of words or notes or colors. Even an AI that can guess well to create an output is still doing so without understanding what it creates, it is no different the randomness created with rules. <br/><br/>(3) potential liability for infringing works generated using AI systems<br/>Regardless of how infringing work is created the liability as well as free use safe haven should be the same. <br/><br/>(4) the treatment of generative AI outputs that imitate the identity or style of human artists.<br/>If this is done without premission or outside of fair use it would be infringment. An AI parady of Chirstopher Walken would be fair use, and AI Walken doing MacBeth is infringing Mr. Walken&#39;s ablity to market himself or be paid for performance. The recent Warhol decision says as much when the works overlap in area of intend use. <br/><br/>
