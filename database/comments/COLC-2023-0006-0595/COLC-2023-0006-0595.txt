Unchecked use of AI will lead to an inability for individuals to secure their copyrights, their work, and their identities. While it is clear that AI will be used as an assistive tool in many industries, the methodologies used to train AI must be made transparent and the resources utilized for training scrupulously accounted for. The boundaries for fair use and compensation cannot be established without these conditions.<br/><br/>I ask that the US Copyright Office aggressively pursue legislation that doesn&#39;t PREVENT the use of AI but demands that there is accountability and recourse for government, corporations and individuals to easily assess what materials have been used to train various AI systems.<br/><br/>I believe if we do this with rigor, we will also be creating systems of accountability that may safeguard domestic work and material from unauthorized use by third parties and foreign entities with malicious intentions.
