Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and their creators should not be treated as infringing on the copyright of any material used in their training sets, as the model is inherently a substantially transformative work and fits the definition for fair use. However, AI generated works should not be able to be copyrighted, as that would stifle the market for human generated works and drive real people out of the market. An exception to that would be where the AI is used to intentionally generate something with the likeness of a real person, in which case the copyright should be automatically granted to the rights holder for that likeness.<br/><br/>In the case where AI generated work is mixed with human created work to create a final product, only the portions of the work that are human generated should be subject to copyright.
