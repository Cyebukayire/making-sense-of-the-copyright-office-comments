It is notable and NO LOBBYIST SHOULD TELL YOU OTHERWISE that all notable forms of AI as we currently know it are trained on existing data provided by humans, including data that the humans did not consent to having included. This means that if you were an artist or musician, or even just someone who posts pictures of your kids online, that companies out there are scraping those art pieces, songs and photos in order to &#39;teach AI patterns&#39;.  It is currently impossible to &#39;inform&#39; AI the nature of anything without teaching it to essentially copy by providing a wide array of inputs generated by real people.  An issue is going to arise very quickly when sites place things in their EULA agreements (and similar agreements) that allow scraping of YOUR data in order to essentially replace you - People will get pushed out of making content because consumers simply do not care about the difference, and won&#39;t care about the difference in quality and &#39;humanity&#39; of the content until many years from now when everything is a soup of circular content.  In order to even make AI better, we would need to keep feeding it non-AI content and until these AI companies start hiring artists en masse for training (by the thousands) it would be completely impractical to begin or continue to train these AI legitimately.  The problem with AI is similar to the problem with &#39;automation taking labor jobs&#39; - but the issue is that art isn&#39;t just a practical thing, and it includes the identity of the workers.  If someone could have your opinions and legislate identically to you, but they didn&#39;t have to pay that person at all and everyone even thought it was pretty much the same as you, you&#39;d probably have a problem with it.  This is essentially what happens when AI is trained on your data.  If you think deepfake technology is wrong and is putting words into peoples mouths and putting peoples faces into situations they were never in, this isn&#39;t much different.  We should not be priced out of the marketplace, and our techniques shouldn&#39;t be seperated from the labor of humans - because even a copy-artist still needs skill and needs a wage.  People say artists will still make art for free even if there wasn&#39;t money in it, and that&#39;s true, but the best artists need a massive amount of time dedicated to the craft, time which they couldn&#39;t possibly spend at any other kind of job in order to get to the skill level that they get before they die.  Please consider this.
