I&#39;m a software engineer with almost 30 years of experience.<br/><br/>To answer inquiry #2 regarding the copyrightability of AI works, <br/>AI work should not be protected under copyright.  <br/><br/>Copyright today is counter to the original intent that a time limited monopoly on copying promotes the advancement of culture (art and technology).  Copyright lengths are too long, usually greater than the life of the originator, and this effectively slows the advancement of culture.<br/><br/>To answer inquiry #1 regarding the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:<br/>AI models improve given the quality of data.  I disagree we should limit the use of public work as a training set.  I support limiting the use of publicly available data by for-profit companies.  I do not support limiting the use of publicly available data.  Copyright law is broken, let&#39;s not use this broken model to further restrict new technology.<br/><br/>To answer inquiry #3 regarding potential liability for infringing works:<br/>Copyright law is broken and I do not support liability for infringement of works outside the original copyright term (14 years)<br/><br/>I do not have a firm opinion on inquiry #4 with regard to AI outputs imitating the identity or style of human artists except that it should not apply to works outside the original copyright term.<br/><br/>
