AI (Generative AI in particular) is built on and fueled by human creation and authorship, from the mundane (Yelp reviews and Reddit threads) to the highest works of journalism, art, science, and literature.<br/><br/>Plainly, Generative AI platforms would not exist without the labor and talent of the approximately 300 million Americans who are participate in the online ecosystem today. Despite the fact that our very own data and authorship are the backbone of these systems, Americans receive nothing in return, while AI companies stand to make billions. What&rsquo;s more, AI companies want the right to register their outputs for copyright, securing even more revenue from these stolen works.<br/><br/>*The use of copyrighted works to train AI models*<br/><br/>Much of the input to Generative AI systems is copyrighted work. Today, no licensing fees or royalties are paid to the original creators. This data is simply consumed en masse by AI models. The AI model then &ldquo;learns&rdquo; from this data, compiles, de-compiles, and spits out derivative works or, in most cases, regurgitated data. Some publishers, such as the New York Times and Conde Nast, have modified their Terms of Service to prohibit this kind of data scraping and theft.<br/><br/>*The eligibility of material generated using AI systems for copyright*<br/><br/>The purpose of copyright is to reward *human* authorship by: 1) providing a tangible means to control the ownership, use, distribution of original works and 2) providing a mechanism for economic exploitation of those works.<br/><br/>A machine is not a human author, no matter how many humans may be involved in its development. Works created by a machine are not eligible for copyright. Looking further to the spirit of copyright, which is to encourage and reward *human* creativity, there is no reason to reward machines for removing jobs from the economy, spreading disinformation, and stealing others&rsquo; data and works of authorship (see above).<br/><br/>*Conclusion*  <br/><br/>Copyright is a system of capitalism, but it has always recognized the importance of human creativity and authorship. At a time when we need human creativity more than ever, let&#39;s not backtrack now.
