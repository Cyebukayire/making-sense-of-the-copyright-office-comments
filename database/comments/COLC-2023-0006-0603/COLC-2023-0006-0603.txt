I&#39;m writing in regards to the use of AI and copyrights, and to get right to it: AI has no business in copyrighted/copyrightable material. It&#39;s typically trained on stolen works-- whether written or visual art-- which in and of itself is an ethical issue, but it also may threaten the livelihoods of those who depend on their created works. Furthermore, the threat (and it is a threat) to have actors and writers sign away their rights to their appearances/art/writing/etc. devalues the lives of creatives, essentially implying that so long as things are cheaper and can generate &#39;more profit&#39; for producers/publishers/etc. then it &#39;doesn&#39;t matter&#39; that the lives of those creatives are being thrown to the wayside and may be left incapable of surviving. <br/><br/>People should come before profits. People should have the rights to their works-- whatever the medium-- and if they make a living from those works they should be able to LIVE off the money they should fairly earn to support themselves. There should be repercussions for theft of their works, for theft through AI datasets being trained on their works without permission. There should be repercussions for AI datasets being trained on ANY works where permission was not given for those works to be fed through AI, regardless of whether those works have been monetized or not. Creatives should have rights to their own names so AI-generated junk can&#39;t have their names slapped on it and said to be theirs when it isn&#39;t.<br/><br/>The unregulated use of AI (and the push various executives have been making to expand it) needs to be curbed. Again, and as my final note on the matter, PEOPLE NEED TO COME BEFORE PROFITS.
