Simply:<br/>* AI-produced works should not be copyrightable<br/>* AI/ML should not be &#39;trainable&#39; on copyrighted works without compensation - to be decided by the original creator. <br/><br/>Copyright should support the original work of creators - the original, human creators. It should reward human creativity. Designing a program to mash other peoples&#39; creative works together, does not create a new, original work.<br/><br/>Movie and television studios are hoping to use AI to create cheap content to avoid having to pay people for their trade, for which they have spent years, or potentially decades, improving. We should reward these people, not cheap knock-offs.<br/><br/>These &quot;plagiarism machines&quot; (AI content generators) are often owned by large companies, who use others&#39; creative, copyrighted works, to &#39;train,&#39; and create output - this output would be owned by the large corporations, not the artists whose work went into building the data they use. This shouldn&#39;t be allowed.<br/><br/>People, not machines, deserve the right to own their work.
