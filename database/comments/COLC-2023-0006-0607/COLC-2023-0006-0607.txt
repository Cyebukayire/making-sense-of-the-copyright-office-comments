AI tools are not themselves creative minds and they draw all their content from actual human being&#39;s works. To do so without compensation or permission should not be permissable. The creative mind is the person using the tool and only adjustments they makes should be considered themselves creative works. The creators of the tool are taking works of others. It should not be permitted, any more than taking images from the internet without lisence, putting them next to each other, and selling the result can be considered fair use.<br/><br/>Making it worse, the AIs stifle creativity - they end up replacing humans with their own content which when they subsequently train with they loose quality. Replacing human creativity in this way results in a net loss for all of us - and for humans to provide new content, those humans must be paid to develop their skills. Using AI to replace lower level jobs especially prevents this. Copyright is intended to encourage and protect human creative works. It cannot do so if it allows AI to run rampant and use any creative works it&#39;s creators wish.
