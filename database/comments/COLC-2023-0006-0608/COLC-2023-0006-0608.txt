Artificial Intelligence should be used or considered for copyright consideration, unless the images/works sourced by the A.I. were created by the rights holder.  Example the copy right holder has 1000s of pieces of their own copyrighted material that the A.I. uses to create &quot;new&quot; material/images.<br/><br/>Under no circumstances should A.I. images using other people&#39;s works/copyrighted materials should be considered for trademark or copyright.  A.I. that has a data set outside of the copyright holder is stealing other peoples work with out permission or attribution.  If AI is to continue to be used in this mannor than all copyrighted images should be found to be uncopyrightable.
