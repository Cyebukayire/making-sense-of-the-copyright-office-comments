while i personally believe that AI-generated content should not be eligible for copyright protection (as currently most AI models work off of stolen examples and the general sentiment is that AI content flies in the face of artists) if the problems of content theft and the replacement of artists in big fields -- movies using AI scripts, news outlets using AI images, et cetera -- were removed, my stance would change. furthermore, if a work is based on AI but does not otherwise use the generated content, it should be eligible for copyright. as an example: let&#39;s say an artist is having trouble envisioning a character, so they use AI for a first draft and then redraw the character themselves based on that generated image. that work could be copyrighted because the AI was used as an assistive tool and not as a replacement of the creative process. in summary, AI content used as a tool in art can be copyrighted, but in it&#39;s current state it should only be used for an inspiration or baseline in the process
