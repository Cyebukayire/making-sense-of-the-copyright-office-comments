It would be a mistake to allow generative AI copyrights because as of this moment it is not really original or creative on its face because of the unattributed and unpaid scrapping of online artworks that actually qualify for copyrights to train these programs. The artworks are then chopped up and put back together in response to a prompt. As there is substantivly no human hand in that generation other than the algorithim they follow for now. Also most of the training materials are used without the creators permission which is a copyright violation for most artworks in and of itself. Copyright should not be awarded to work derived from things stolen from other artists.
