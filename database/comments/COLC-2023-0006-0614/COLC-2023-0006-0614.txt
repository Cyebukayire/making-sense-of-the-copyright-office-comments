As a professional writer for nearly half a century now, I have been &quot;informed&quot; over and over in the last few months, by those developing AI and those using it commercially, that they have every right to steal my work, use it in whatever way they choose, &amp; decline any compensation or acknowledgement, that this is a &quot;natural&quot; use of &quot;past works&quot; regardless of their legal standing, and there is nothing I can do about it. I would very much appreciate it if the US Copyright Office would make the decision that copyrights cannot simply be overlooked, ignored or violated simply because that&#39;s the easiest and least expensive way to do things.<br/><br/>Otherwise, what good is copyright?
