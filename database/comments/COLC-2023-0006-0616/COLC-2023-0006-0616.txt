So-called &quot;artificial intelligent&quot; generators, including procedural image generation and machine learning language models, work primarily by cutting up and &#39;remixing&#39; their training data. The machines have no intention in their remixing, there is no act of creation. It&#39;s just theft. Artificial intelligence trained on anything other than intentionally curated, licensed data models should not be copyrightable or monetizable. Artists and creators who find their work was used in the creation of AI &quot;art,&quot; or who find that such &quot;art&quot; is intentionally mimicking their signature style, should have quick, legal recourse to remove such works from display.
