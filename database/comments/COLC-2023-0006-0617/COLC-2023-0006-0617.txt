I believe that the use of AI for media should be limited by copyright. It is unfair that writers, artists, and creatives worldwide are having their jobs and future threatened by AI. By using AI as a cheaper alternative to working people on movies, shows, and other forms of media, studios will be creating a cheap product, one without any human touch in it, a hollow shell of an artificial idea. AI is only functional using previously created media from humans. AI doesn&#39;t think in the way we do, or create. It mashes images together, or words together, mimicking the creations of real people. Stealing is the nature of AI, and should be treated as such. Under the right laws, AI could become less of a threat to the creative community.
