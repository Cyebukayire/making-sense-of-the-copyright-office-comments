Generative artificial intelligence is by its very basis an unoriginal mode of expression. It derives the substance of every response to a prompt from scouring the Internet for existing material, much of which already exists under U.S. copyright protection. Without any means of tracking or identifying copyrighted material within the responses given by ChatGPT or other GAI tools, we have no way of respecting the copyrights of those rights holders. There need to be regulatory tools, known in some circles as Ethical AI, to be able to track and attribute copyrighted material wherever it is used, and in turn, those rights holders deserve to be compensated for any use of their copyrighted material in creating any new works, whether this is literary or artistic in nature. As a writer, I am deeply concerned about the use of AI in attempting to &quot;create&quot; any new material when it is in fact deriving this material from copyrighted works. I urge you to consider stronger copyright protections for any works on the Internet, particularly when these are used for commercial &quot;repurposing&quot; by AI. In addition, as the Writers Guild of America has espoused, there should never be copyright given to a non-human creator of any sort. These protections are necessary for preserving the sustainability of the arts in all forms. Thank you.
