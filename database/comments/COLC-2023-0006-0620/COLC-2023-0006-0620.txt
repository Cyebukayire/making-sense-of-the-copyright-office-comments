At the current moment, AI tools such as ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and others are being used to replace American workers in a number of vital industries that uphold the country&#39;s backbone. It&#39;s a disgrace to be one of the first countries to adopt the laziest method of producing art and culture, leaving many without work as companies strive to produce low-quality high-speed products lacking the American spirit that we were all raised on. AI/Automatically generated assets should not be held to the same standards as currently copyrighted material, and should not be eligible for copyright, because of the lack of human touch, the unclear ownership of assets, and the nature of these trained databases almost all being formed on the back of stolen copyrighted work themselves. Ethical action is not a consideration in mind for any of the companies currently developing or training AI and it is their all-but-explicit goal to hoard wealth from unsuspecting American families and render every possible industrial position, be they the arts or the trades, into sweatshops where humans are stolen from and wealth is amassed in the hands of frankly un-American economic power-hogs.
