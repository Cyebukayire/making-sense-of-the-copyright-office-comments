As a professional illustrator, the potential future of AI image generation terrifies me. I have to literally fear of losing out on my livelihood being my main source of income, a skill that I have spent years upon years working on to master my craft. All because any potential client can just result to something cheap and easy, even if it looks worse. Not to mention the fact that the databases for these AI image generators are built by stealing art from a wide array of artists without any consent, often taking copyrighted images.
