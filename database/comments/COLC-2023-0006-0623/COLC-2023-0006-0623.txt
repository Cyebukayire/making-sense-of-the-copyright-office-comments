I&#39;m an author, and have already seen how AI shutters creativity and opportunity. A few months ago, my community was robust and supportive, with people sharing ideas they were excited about, which, in turn, sparked ideas in others. Professional connections were forged because of people&#39;s willingness to share snippets of their work. Now, due to a fear of AI replicating our work, and producing a shoddy copy faster than we can finish our own human-made product, many of us are scared to share anything. I have already witnessed the impact of this--open calls for story pitches are being ignored or shut down entirely, people are pulling moodboards from their social media, and I&#39;ve talked to people who are too scared to brainstorm with others to improve their own work. If AI were to become copyrightable, these issues would only get worse, and more and more people would cease writing entirely. Already, AI is trained on stolen work. What happens when it&#39;s trained on stolen work that&#39;s derivative of a derivation? AI is unsustainable, and I fear the publishing system would collapse before any of the rulings responsible could be overturned. And once that collapse happens it take be decades, at best, to rebuild the system. Human art and human livelihood are important, and allowing AI to become copyrightable would destroy, not only art as we know it, but the economy, as well.
