The use of AI to create art, written word, music, etc is absolutely a form of copyright infringement. The AI needs to learn from existing art to create a Frankenstein of everything it knows. It is not unique, and actively hurts people who do creative work as this program can create art in seconds while people take years to create the very works it learns from. The rise in AI art has led to people selling works online to make a profit on something that they did not make. To claim a prompt is your own, whether it produces and image or a story, is inherently wrong and immoral. No effort was put into creating the work, and is not comparable to the effort REAL artists put into their own creations. The prompt may be original, but no work is put into creating anything that is produced. Using ai art as a starting point for original work is valid in my opinion, as it is inspiration, but to sell and distribute the work as one&#39;s own is wrong. There is no skill in writing a prompt, and even if it is argued that there is some special wording needed, the amount of work put into the product is not their own. It is the machine taking parts of existing works to pretend to create something unique. There should be laws against selling work created by ai. The practice is immoral and takes away jobs from real people. Copyright protects an original piece of work, so where is the protection for the artist&#39;s whose work was stolen?
