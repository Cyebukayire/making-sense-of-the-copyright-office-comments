Dear Regulations Office,<br/><br/>There has to be some sort of regulation being implemented for the use of ai works. Currently, it is horrible. Please make it so that they aren&#39;t able to be copyrighted, it&#39;s blatant theft when the base that they&#39;re using for their creation is from an amalgamation of different creators. These creators are the ones that should be paid, not the thieves. There&#39;s so many people losing hope in a creative career and dropping out of school because of ai. Companies have started taking advantage by not hiring artists at all and is using online database to create their work instead. In an already inflated economy, the people who are affected, writers, artists, voice actors and designers, will lose their jobs. They&#39;re already living on minimum wage, why make their lives harder?<br/><br/>Ai work shouldn&#39;t be able to be copyrighted at all. It should be used as a personal tool for helping people with creative work, not completely replace them. Please implement stricter rules against ai works or ai programs in general. Please actually listen to the voices of us artists and creatives this time. Thank you.
