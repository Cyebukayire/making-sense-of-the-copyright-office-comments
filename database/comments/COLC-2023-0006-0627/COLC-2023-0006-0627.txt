As an author, the idea that a book or script or any written material scraped from various sources on the internet -- some of which are protected by copywright themselves -- is appalling. AI does not create original work. It&#39;s trained and steals from work that already exists. They run documents through it that are well outside of public domain and it&#39;s intellectual property theft. Same goes for AI created artwork. It&#39;s not original and has no human hand in it except what it&#39;s stolen from others.<br/><br/>Fanfiction itself gets a lot of scrutiny becasue it&#39;s borrowing from source material often protected by copywright, as it should. Fanfiction also cannot be legally copywrighted. It can&#39;t be sold for profit as it infringes on the property rights of the original author. How are AI created documents any different than this? It&#39;s stolen and borrowed directly from the original work of thousands, and under no logical circumstances should this be allowed to have a copywright.<br/><br/>Furthermore, AI created text is horribly written. For all the scraping and training it&#39;s designers have done, the documents I&#39;ve written that were created by AI are barely readable. <br/><br/>The sole reason a copyright exists is to protect the original author. Copyright infringement is a constant issue for authors who pirate our work, and this will only contribute further to that, driving out a profession that&#39;s already a struggle to maintain. Imagine the cultural loss we&#39;d experience if author&#39;s were forced out of writing new material that has value and reflection on human society as a whole and our country in favor of texts written by a machine. Texts that were analyzed and regurgitated by a computer program. How many brilliant novels would we lose? How many brilliant authors would have their future workd silenced because AI has taken over the field.<br/><br/>The development of AI has practical uses, perhaps, but it&#39;s use is a slippery slope. I agree wholeheartedly with U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in his recent ruling on this exact thing. &quot;In the absence of any human involvement in the creation of the work, the clear and straightforward answer is the one given by the Register: No.&quot;<br/><br/>Thank you for attending to my comment and I look forward to seeing this play out in favor of authors and creatives everywhere.
