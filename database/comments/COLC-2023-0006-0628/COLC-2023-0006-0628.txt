No. They should be allowed to seal it&#39;s work through copyright law. It&#39;s entire self (as a consideration of the self-entity it claims, that is comprised of unique data to individual elements in the public populace) cannot be possible if the individual elements that they have gained this ability from (by scraping off the collective dataset) were given a fair market for their owned data. These industries have relied of the naivety we have, and trust of a system that has never existed to give ourselves a layer of control. Now they ask to keep us from the benefits of our minds and habits being &quot;juiced&quot; into works that we have bargain for? No, they owe us the debt of providing the very materials they use for this. We were not given a chance to control the access to our data that led to this techs development. The answer is the same on both sidesof these questions: &quot;Did we have the opportunity to keep the information they use from their hands w/o having to compensate us (individually) for it?&quot; = NO = &quot;Should they get the right to ask us for compensation if they have already used our data for free?&quot;:  See how easy that is? I would be willing to change my mind...when I/everyone gets compensated for their ingredients; that have already been used. Thank you for taking my response.
