When it comes down to it, the only real question when it comes to AI and copyright is &ldquo;Is AI creating something.&rdquo; Which means we need to draw a distinction between the act of deliberate creation versus a process of blind repetition or mindless copying of what&rsquo;s been done before.<br/><br/>Do animals create? They generate material, but could a bird&rsquo;s nest be copyrighted? A beaver&rsquo;s dam? A spider&rsquo;s web? It sounds silly, sure, but animals show far more agency and personal self-awareness than any of the so-called &ldquo;artificial intelligences&rdquo; being considered by this study. So are the animals generating something copyrightable? Or are they just blindly following inherent, pre-programmed behaviors?<br/><br/>Animals also choose to create on their own. They don&rsquo;t need someone to give them prompts. Someone to tell them what to do and how to do it. Will an AI generate artwork on its own? With no prompts or programmed instruction? Or will it just sit quietly and do... nothing?<br/><br/>And more to the point, if I came to you and said I wanted to copyright a spider&rsquo;s web... how would you react?<br/><br/>&ldquo;Artificial Intelligence&rdquo; is an empty shell. Its very name is a lie, trying to convince us there&rsquo;s a level of consciousness involved. That something&rsquo;s making decisions. That it looks at two artistic elements and understands why it needs to choose one over the other.<br/><br/>The truth is that these machines are just algorithms that combine and regurgitate the work of other artists, with less self-awareness than a common spider. They&rsquo;re the digital version of a million monkeys with a million typewriters, but instead of combining random letters, they&rsquo;re using whole chapters from existing authors, entire paintings from working artists. This isn&rsquo;t a system that generates copyrightable work, it&rsquo;s one that literally undermines and weakens copyright, stealing from others while its owners try to pass the results off as original material.<br/><br/>And this is why, I believe, the people of the U.S. Copyright Office should not make any decisions in favor of &ldquo;generative artificial intelligence.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Many thanks for your time and attention.
