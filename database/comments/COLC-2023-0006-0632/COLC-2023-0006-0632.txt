I work in bioinformatics, which incorporates basic machine learning/AI in many of its activities, and know many friends who are artists. From what I have seen and heard, generative AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), have incredible potential for technological growth. However, this growth cannot and should not be achieved by depriving artists, technicians, or anyone in possession of knowledge or skill of their right to profit by those skills. I do not see how we can, in good conscience, allow models to profit off of artists&#39; styles, particularly not when there have already been cases of models trained to mimic the art of established creators (e.g. Greg Rutkowski&mdash;see &quot;This Tool Could Protect Artists From A.I.-Generated Art That Steals Their Style&quot;, New York Times, 13 Feb 2023). Nor do I think we should quash innovation in AI, however, as it could well provide new innovations in a multitude of technological fields, such as cancer cell detection, natural language processing, and more.<br/><br/>I urge the Copyright Office to seriously and deliberately consider the effects and dangers of allowing AI data gathering to run rampant without regulation or regard to copyright. The right to choose how and when to copy or distribute one&#39;s own intellectual property is integral to the ability of artists and other creative professions, as well as the ability of companies to make and sell products. It is also a powerful force in favor of innovation. Therefore, it is my opinion that it is of utmost importance to implement laws and/or regulations to protect people from use of their data and creations in AI model training without their consent.
