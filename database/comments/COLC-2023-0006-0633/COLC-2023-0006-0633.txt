Hello! I am a screenwriter and an author, and I am very concerned about AI and copyright infringement. Please do not allow tech comapnies to weaken or make an endrun around our sopyrights. If large tech companies are able to train their AI on material I wrote without my permission and without paying me anything, and then turn around and profit from their results (be it by ads or subscription), that seems a clear violation. It seems like theft. Right now, you can go on Chat GPT and ask it to write something in the style of any author or screenwriter. Because it has trained on those writers, it can actually do a disturbingly good job imitating them. More than imitation - what any school teacher would call plagiarizing. And it will only get better. Shouldn&#39;t the authors of the works it trained on get paid for the intellectual property stolen by the AI companies to create their product? This end run around artists&#39; copyrights will end up forcing people out of the arts. I&#39;m sure fancy lawyers will make excellent arguments and twist language - but in this case, imitation is not flattery. It is training a machine on my and others work without any payment, and then profiting off of that work. Please keep this in check - creative industries will literally implode if not. And as Americans, one of our greatest exports is our culture and the brainpower behind it. Unchecked AI will wreck that. If copyright is kept, and the artists are somehow paid for their work, or given residuals when their work is used to help the AI, at least they can survive. Thank you, and pleas eprotect the humans over the machines!
