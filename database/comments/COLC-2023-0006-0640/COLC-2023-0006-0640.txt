AI is a disgrace to human ingenuity when it comes to art and other things. It often uses the labor of other people to shortcut the process for people too lazy and unwilling to learn and toil. They want results now, and don&#39;t care who they steal from to feed their algorithm in order to get it. It has discouraged so many young artists from continuing to even try, all in the name of greed. And let&#39;s be clear, that&#39;s EXACTLY what it is: greed.
