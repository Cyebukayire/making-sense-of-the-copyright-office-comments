AI is a blight on creative industries. The courts have already ruled that AI can&rsquo;t be copy written due to its lack of human involvement. Proprietors of this plagiarism technology are already trying to undermine the work of creatives by hiring &ldquo;writers&rdquo; to polish generated content. It does genuine harm to industry professionals who are trying to afford a life during an economic recession. Additionally, it&rsquo;s a system that lives solely on a model of plagiarism, as it cannot &ldquo;learn&rdquo; or make new content, merely regurgitate information it&rsquo;s been fed with no actual means of transformation.
