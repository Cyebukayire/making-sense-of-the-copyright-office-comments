Hello there,<br/><br/>Since your form requests that I hold any personally identifiable information, I will instead simply refer to myself as P.R. It is wonderful to reach out to you.<br/><br/>I have been drawing for nearly 15 years now online, sharing my art and comics with thousands of other people who have recently supported me so much as to finally have a small published book of my work. With my credentials in place, I wish to address two issues in my comments: 1) that AI generation takes art without fair compensation or recognition to artists and 2) that AI generation should not be protected by US copyright law.<br/><br/>To my first point: I cannot say, with full certainty, that my work has or has not been used as a basis for generative AI modeling. But I know that if it were, I would want to know. I would want those companies who are using my work to generate money and attention to have to tell me. Modeling work in AI is not the same as mimicking or referencing styles, as those who support AI &quot;art&quot; so often say. For those of you reading, if you have ever tried to draw something exactly as it is seen, you know how difficult this can be. <br/><br/>AI generation takes an artist&#39;s hard work and makes it easy to copy with the mere click of the button. What took years before now only takes minutes. Talent has been replaced by mockery. I know that those who support AI &quot;art&quot; are quick to say that what they &quot;create&quot; is the same as what we do. But it is not. I can use pencil and paper to draw. I know how to paint. I learned these things and practiced these skills. They are not creating. There is no human talent involved in what they have &quot;created&quot;. They are stealing and giving nothing back to the community they have stolen from. In my many years, I have never once met an artist who has done the same. <br/><br/>AI generators do not respect the fundamental courtesies that artists have tirelessly worked to create. We ask to be recognized for our work and AI generators and their creators should be expected to give us that much. They should be required to ask if we permit our work to enter their systems and, if so, they should be required to compensate when appropriate.<br/><br/>To my second point: AI generated creations do not deserve to be protected by copyright law. The reason is simple: they have not created anything. I have been very careful in my wording to this point. They generated an idea and did not create the final product. If I handed my dog a paint brush and a canvas and left it in a room for an hour, would the result be mine or the dog&#39;s? And if we assume that it is not mine, then therefore neither can be AI art. And I have met many on the opposing side who claim that photography falls into the same category. How can we protect a picture of a tree? My answer is simple: I have seen many pictures of trees and some are much nicer than others. I can tell when care is put into design, angle, and composition. A human had no say in that during the AI generative process. This is not a matter of &quot;theft&quot; of art or design. It is a matter of &quot;who&quot; created &quot;what&quot;. AI generators do not create anything. <br/><br/>But beyond the moral implications here it is also impractical to enforce. If two &quot;AI artists&quot; both generate &quot;beautiful white woman with blonde hair and brown eyes staring into a flower field&quot;, who can claim the idea first? If the machine decides that both their results look the same-- for example, that the woman may be young, wearing a beautiful hat and blue dress-- who can possibly claim their creation first? Neither of them chose to have the woman wear a blue dress, but the machine did. How can we practically enforce that which a human did not design? If two songs are generated and they sound the same based on an algorithm and not human design, how can we possibly decide that someone &quot;violated another&#39;s copyright?&quot; <br/><br/>Humans did not create these things and therefore they cannot be protected. I make the fair claim that-- in recognition of both the lack of humanity involved and the difficulties of enforcement-- that AI generations be considered public domain upon creation. <br/><br/>While I understand where my opposition may disagree with me, I summarize my point succinctly: AI generations-- whether they be art, writing, music, etc.-- do not involve human creation during the process. Without that fundamental requirement, I do not believe that AI generation meet the historic and necessary definition of copyright protections of intellectual property. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time. <br/><br/>
