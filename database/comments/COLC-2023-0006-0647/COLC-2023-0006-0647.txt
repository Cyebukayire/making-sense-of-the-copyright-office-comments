Note: I am someone who primarily engages in artistic works from a media criticism perspective and personal enjoyment (example: character design for tabletop gaming, purchasing and enjoying media, etc.). As such I can really only comment on the broad level questions discussed in section IV. Current Inquiry:<br/><br/>The use of copyrighted works to train AI models<br/><br/>I would argue that the only feasible and ethical method for the use of copyrighted material for AI training models is an opt-in method. I consider this primarily a question of personal ownership over our data on the web as it is my understanding AI models often scrape material off the internet. While the expectation of privacy is low on public websites, I don&rsquo;t believe that should therefore make it open season on our data to be used by others for whatever purposes they want.<br/><br/>As I discuss later, I don&rsquo;t believe that imitation of artistic style should be considered a violation of copyright as it would be too limiting of a restriction for human artists. That said, because of the extent to which AI is often being promoted as a method of replacing human artists (ex: the writer/actor strikes, which have brought up concerns of studios using motion cap and AI generative models to replace extras and other smaller roles). If copyright is meant for the protection of human creative output and to allow for artist to profit off of art through the introduction of artificial scarcity, allowing use of data taken without permission is putting human artistic effort at risk of simply failing to be able to compete with the sheer quantity of media that could be generated if art is able to be taken without permission.<br/><br/>Databases should also be publicly available with some sort of method of allowing artists to make some attempt to search through for their materials. In general, however, an opt-in system is the only reasonable method for both sides (artists and the model) to ensure full transparency and that artists works are not being included without permission. An opt-out system would simply be too unwieldy, especially if based on scraping of data online, as there can be no reasonable expectation that the artist or company could remove all works.<br/><br/>The copyrightability of material generated using AI systems <br/><br/>I believe the general standards right now are still correct. Artistic works should represent primarily meaningful artistic choice and direction by the artist. Prompts are too high level of an abstract stage of the creative process, essentially representing a general description of the artistic work desired and is not the work itself. It would be like attempting to copyright the entirety of a novel&rsquo;s content because you wrote the back of the book description of the contents. In theory I guess you could copyright the prompt in that sense, in that a prompt could represent a meaningful written work in of itself, but since the purpose of a prompt is to then be placed in an AI model to then create an &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; work, copyrighting the prompt would not be meaningful as it is simply meant to, essentially, be an indirect method to try and copyright the work produced by the AI model.<br/><br/>Potential liability for infringing works generated using AI systems<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is a question I do not think I can opine on due to an unfamiliarity with the exact processes that generate content in the model.<br/><br/>The treatment of generative AI outputs that imitate the identity or style of human artists.<br/><br/>As someone with a background in political science, my biggest concern on imitation is the use of AI content to mimic individuals for the purpose of misinformation (ex: faking a video of a politician), but broader concerns regarding generation of fake content for other reasons (ex: revenge porn) are also of a concern. A strict opt-in system and greater protection of the inclusion of individual likeness, voice, etc. in datasets would go a long way towards dealing with these issues. The extent to which video and audio of public figures is often not strictly owned by an individual (ex: actors) presents a unique problem and requires additional input from people in those fields (see the writer/actor strikes occurring at this time).<br/><br/>As for a general comment of imitation of style, ultimately all human artistic effort involves at least some level of imitation of existing artistic influences. If I was to draw an animated movie that looked similar in style to a Studio Ghibli film, for example, I do not think it would be beneficial to general creative output to allow Studio Ghibli to claim copyright simply because the style looked similar (provided I otherwise was making it clear it was not a Studio Ghibli movie). The extent to which I have concerns about AI art being used to imitate styles, it&rsquo;s more a matter of being able to do so in a mass productive manner that human artist cannot compete with while removing the human part of the production process.<br/>
