AI scraping art and documents for use without permission should be a violation, since the purpose of doing so is to replicate the artist or writer&#39;s style and thus lessen any business the artist or writer may get for their art or writing. Works produced by an AI should not be copywriteable, since the AI did the work to produce the content and not any business or human, but an AI cannot make decisions to dictate how its art is used.
