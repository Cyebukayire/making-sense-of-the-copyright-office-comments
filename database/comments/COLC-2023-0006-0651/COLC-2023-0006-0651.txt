It&#39;s absurd to me that people in both corporate and government leadership positions are spending their time talking about how to use AI within businesses before those selfsame groups have figured out the most effective way to take care of their HUMAN workers. People need livable wages, healthcare, mental health support, guaranteed parental leave and paid time off, and much much more. It&#39;s atrocious that there are people looking to push through policies or set new standards for how artificial intelligence can be used for profit at a time like this. The US Copyright Office should continue to hold the focus on the humanity at the center of our country and communities, not AI potentials.
