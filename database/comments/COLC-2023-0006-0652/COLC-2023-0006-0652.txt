Regarding AI use and specifically AI data collection, I feel there should be more regulation and required transparency about where training information is mined from. In situations of image generation, we have already seen AI programs create art clearly referential to a specific artist, muddying their stylistic claim and subject matter. We also are seeing this in writing in the right circumstances, although I think it is less obvious with writing. In a world where so many creators like artists and writers include previews or samples of their work online for the sake of self-promotion and future sales, the line between what is available to be trained on and what is copyrighted material is a blurry one at best and more likely, overlaps completely, especially on public archives and social media.<br/><br/>In my opinion, AI regeneration currently has an incredible amount of freedom in creating from and, frankly, exploiting the works of others. More regulation is needed to protect people rather than protect machine output.
