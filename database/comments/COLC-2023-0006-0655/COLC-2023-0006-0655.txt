I am a writer. I invest time, work, and money in researching and developing my stories. To have my copyrighted work fed to a machine that would then approximate my work and give it away for free is theft not only of my copyright, but of my investment. Moreover, copyright law protects &quot;the fruits of intellectual labor.&quot; (Feist Publications v Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc. 499 U.S. 340 (1991)). As much as the plagiarism machine is craftily marketed as &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; it is not performing intellectual labor of any kind. Copyright must also apply to original works. A worse version of something I created that was shat out by a plagiarism robot is not an original work. One need only look into the comments of the original creators of the plagiarism machines, such as Geoffrey Hinton, who regrets his contribution to the tech landscape because of how hard it is to stop &quot;bad actors from doing bad things.&quot; Regulating the use of so-called AI is the only hope of stopping bad actors. Or at the very least, not rendering the life&#39;s work of actual humans unprotected, reappropriated, and regurgitated, but not remunerated.
