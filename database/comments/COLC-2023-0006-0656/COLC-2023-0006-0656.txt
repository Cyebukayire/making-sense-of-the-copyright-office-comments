Generative AI works by scanning art and writing made by humans and generating something new with it. The fact that people would want to copyright this work is, frankly, confusing to me. They simply wrote a prompt. There is little creativity in that. There is absolutely no craftmanship or skill in that. AI works cannot be copyrighted because it&#39;s an amalgamation of others&#39; art (or, in some cases, a direct copy of someone&#39;s art). I truly do not believe that any AI work should be copyrighted, because it was made by a computer and not the person copyrighting it.
