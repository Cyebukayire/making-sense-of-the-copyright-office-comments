I have seen the work of independent artists used to train ai to profit large corporations without credit or compensation to said original artists. This has created a bleak climate, hostile to artists and creatives in any field, and if left unchecked it will bring about greater poverty and unemployment and fury from already disenfranchised and angry people. <br/>Intellectual property as it currently exists in the US is used almost exclusively to benefit corporate interests at the expense of working class artists, this is nothing new, but this is a critical time where government risks ushering in a new era of corporate overreach, wherein people will not even be safe from having their likenesses, voices and mannerisms stolen from them and used indefinitely, even after they are dead, for the profit of corporations who each year consolidate and inch closer to monopolizing the media landscape. <br/>If laws are not put in place and enforced to protect those who make up the bulk of society, and in this case, the bulk of creative society, then they will go hungry and lose more and more of their livelihoods until they have nothing left, and when that happens no rhetoric, no bribes, no threat of violence will dissuade them. They wont protest, they go on strike, they&rsquo;ll riot, or worse. If the future is sold to the highest bidder, hope and everything we have to lose goes with it, and then people will no longer seek protection or restorative justice, they&rsquo;ll seek revenge.
