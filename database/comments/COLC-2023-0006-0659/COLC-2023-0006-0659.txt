As an actor, writer, and designer, it feels frightening that a trained computer model might not just put me out of work but sabotage the creative outlets that give life meaning. <br/><br/>By all means, let computers handle the drudgery and free us up for more noble pursuits, but now it seems that the forces of capitalism want to let the computers tackle the noble pursuits and leave the drudgery to us. <br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the creators of popular systems like OpenAI  intentionally violated copyrights by using copyrighted works as training data. Just because it&rsquo;s on the web doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s free to use, and being able to ask an algorithm to create a work in the style of an author whose corpus has been ingested in this manner is theft.<br/><br/>While this may not be a copyright issue directly, the fact that large studios are trying to scan day players and extras, to use their likenesses in perpetuity without payment of royalties or residuals, also feels like theft. <br/><br/>In all these cases, the work of highly trained professionals is fed into, essentially, a version of autocomplete on steroids; it fills in gaps based on what&rsquo;s statistically likelier to follow the previous thing. <br/><br/>But what this has created is not a useful tool but an automated plagiarism machine - and worse, since it is not a sentient intelligence, it has no idea if the words it is stringing together are meaningful or even factually correct. People are publishing AI-created books with fake author names, containing not just incorrect but potentially harmful information (for instance, about poisonous plants, legal precedents, or incorrect mathematics which would lead to fatal accidents.)<br/><br/>For the sanity and health of our nation and our democracy, this nascent industry must be regulated, its outputs subject to human fact checking, and its inputs free of plagiarized works.
