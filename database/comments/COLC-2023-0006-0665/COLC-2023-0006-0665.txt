In all senses, it should be observed that I have no stake either in AI, AI Training, or copyrighted material at risk of being used for AI training.<br/>With that in mind I would make the following observations.  There are three extreme paths forward we can take with AI development.  <br/>1. We prohibit all work on AI and forbid its use.<br/>2. We halt further development.<br/>3. We let develop AI develop unhindered.<br/>(There are obviously many combinations of these extremes).<br/>I submit that irrespective of what we in the United States do, there will be people, states or countries that will choose path 3.<br/><br/>When they choose this path, they will use any and all means to train their AI&#39;s without respect to property ownership.  Given that competitive advantage over any more hindered paths available to US entities developing AI, then it is likely that US efforts will be doomed.  This could put the US in incredible danger.  If AI&#39;s develop superhuman capabilities, outside the US control then our children and grandchildren will never be safe.<br/><br/>While I have great sympathy for peoples whose work is going to be taken without permission for training AI&#39;s, really these people will be no more disadvantaged that those whose jobs AI&#39;s will inevitably take away.  Further, this is nothing new.  Anybody whose work has been used to train other individuals has always suffered their work being used without consent.  There isn&#39;t an artist who has ever lived that did not receive input from artists who went before him.  The only difference this time is that it&#39;s an artificial intelligence that is being trained rather than a new young artist.<br/><br/>Technology has always displaced humans.  AI is but the latest example.  There are virtually no examples of technologies being successfully suppressed to prevent unemployment.  This is just the next step in technological evolution.<br/><br/>I thus urge the people making decisions regarding copyright infringement to put the best interests of all US citizens ahead and allow any materials to be used for AI training without hindrance.  Of course this shouldn&#39;t permit people to profit from outright copying and plagiarism.  All other use should be &quot;fair use&quot;.
