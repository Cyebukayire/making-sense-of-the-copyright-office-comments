Allowing ai art to be copyrighted would be the same as rewarding people for plagiarism. It&rsquo;s theft and it is lazy. Besides, even if you think it has short term benefits, it won&rsquo;t have many long term ones. An over saturation in AI works is current causing something akin to AI inbreeding. AI is beginning to feed and steel from itself, which is getting more and more garbled and nonsensical finished products. American media will become a laughing stock, and we will undermine the core principles of our economic beliefs. Thank you for listening &lt;3
