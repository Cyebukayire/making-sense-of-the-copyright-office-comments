AI as it is currently being sold is a farce. It takes data without consent and packages it up pretending that the machine is learning all while it pirates information. This could open up people to lawsuits because if we can just take things and say the machine learned it then where can that stop. You could make deep fakes and have no repercussion. This would erode the trust people have with media all because a bunch of companies with no financial literacy or liquidity want to sell you on a fantasy. If this isn&rsquo;t nipped in the bud you may as well have agreed to sell your home to the Avon lady.
