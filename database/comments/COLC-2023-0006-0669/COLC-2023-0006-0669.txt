While AI can be very useful and helpful in other areas, I find it distressing how it is being used in &quot;art&quot;. Especially, commercially. AI software takes human made creations without permission (theft) to feed into algorithms which create lifeless imitations of someone&#39;s work without compensation or authorisation. It is becoming upsetting how fast it is developing without any laws or restrictions on what it can be used to for and with. I do not believe AI art is art at all. No skill or training has gone into it.
