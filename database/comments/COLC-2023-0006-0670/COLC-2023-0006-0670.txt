I am a writer, primarily in the gaming sphere. However I have ambitions to become a novelist. Suffice it to say &#39;AI Art&#39; and &#39;AI Writing&#39; pose a significant threat to my ambitions.<br/><br/>Art, regardless of the form it takes, is made by people. The point of copyright is to allow people to profit off their work, therefore incentivizing people to make works of art either as freelancers or employers. <br/><br/>&#39;AI Art&#39; requires both significant technological infrastructure and human intervention. (See the &#39;Shakespeare and monkeys&#39; thought experiment.) The way Language Learning models work, if that they take in data, reshuffle it, and spit it out. This creates an inordinate amount of garbage that is then sorted by human beings. It is a Sysiphean task. Draining the ocean via thimble.<br/><br/>&#39;AI Art&#39; at least has a use as disposable artwork for personal use. But we&#39;ve already seen it take jobs away from cover artists in a variety of interests. Garbage spat out of algorithms and presented to the public as a worthy piece of artwork. This takes money out of the economy and demeans humanity.<br/><br/>I am under no illusions. Commercial artwork has always existed and will always exist. We have records of Gladiators in ancient Rome wearing the logos of businesses on their armor. We have examples of businesses branding their products with noticeable iconography going back to Sumer. The thing is, and call me a shill if you so desire. A properly made bit of commercial art can be pleasing to the eye and enriching to the soul.<br/><br/>That is what human art, even crass commercial art does. It makes our lives better. It is a commodity meant to provide padding to the harsh, cutting edge of existence.<br/><br/>Now we have machines that are fed words and images from creators who do not consent. Copyright and Intellectual Property infringement on a scale one can hardly imagine engaged in 24/7, 365. It needs to stop. If this body holds any respect for human endeavor measures need to be taken to ensure that artists *human* artists with *human* concerns like groceries, rent, car repairs, medical bills and so on and so forth are put before the concerns of the wealthy individuals who can afford to run Language Learning models and Image Generation Engines.<br/><br/>Now, I will freely admit that I have used this software to create throw away art for personal use. But that&#39;s the thing, this is personal use. I did not charge a person for this artwork that I did not make. That was created using unlicensed use of someone else&#39;s artistic material.<br/><br/>While the technologies in question do have uses as a moneymaking endeavor they should be a dead end. Artists and Writers, people who spent time learning their craft. People who have worked in the industry, should be paid for the creation of art, scripts, books and so on. I ask you to take into consideration the profound economic damage this technology will do to creative professionals that already labor under contracts that often demean their spirit and undermine their ability to earn a living with their craft.
