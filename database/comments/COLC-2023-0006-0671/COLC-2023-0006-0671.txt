I believe that the AI tools themselves aren&#39;t an issue, but the data that they are being fed by users is. If a content creator is using their own work and only their work in order to facilitate or automate creation then that is fine. If an AI tool is being told to sift through countless pieces of other people&#39;s published content in order to create a working algorithm producing content based on such, that is not fine. I think that&#39;s theft of people&#39;s properties and works. Content created in such a manner using other people&#39;s content without their consent should not be protected. The original creators should have the right to sue for infringement/damages/removal of the content etc.<br/><br/>AI and machine learning tools will only get better and see wider use with time. I think it is imperative to adopt some sort of code of ethics to curb potential misuse.
