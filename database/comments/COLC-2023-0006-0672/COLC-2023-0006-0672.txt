AI &quot;art&quot; should not be able to be copyrighted. The &quot;artwork&quot; is not the work of an individual, and instead requires the AI to pull from already existing artwork/images. It is quite simply manipulation/editing of existing artwork/art styles. Copyright belongs to the original individual of an artpiece--that is not what AI &quot;art&quot; is creating, however. They are not inherently original pieces, and as AI &quot;art&quot; stands presently it is impossible for AI &quot;art&quot; to create an inherently original piece.
