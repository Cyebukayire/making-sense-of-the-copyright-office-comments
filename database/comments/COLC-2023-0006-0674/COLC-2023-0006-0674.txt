AI should not be able to apply for copyright for its output. AI is a non-thinking machine. It simply identifies the probabilities and relationships between the items in its data set. It is not being creative. It is not originating. It does not even necessarily create output that is correct, or even safe, as highlighted by recent situations where a recipe AI provided directions that would cause those following the recipe to create poisonous gases. <br/><br/>On top of these issues with AI, there is also the sheer quantity of output possible. Because it is a machine, AI could be set up to auto-generate such copious volumes of content that it would become difficult, if not impossible, for human creators to stay current with the field. This could potentially put human creators in the crosshairs of &quot;copyright trolls&quot; who pump out and copyright so much AI content that humans would have difficulty creating anything that didn&#39;t infringe on some AI output&#39;s copyright.
