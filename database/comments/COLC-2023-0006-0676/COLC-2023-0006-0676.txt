I believe that while AI has its uses as a tool, the way it currently is is too unregulated; AI uses people&#39;s work or voices without permission. This endangers some people&#39;s livelihoods, and leads to confusion on all parts of what belongs to who when AI artwork, &#39;voices&#39;, writing or otherwise is used in a professional sense. I believe that AI must have stricter laws introduced in order to clarify what counts as &#39;rightful use&#39; and to protect people&#39;s rights to their work and prevent their work from being stolen for the use of AI.
