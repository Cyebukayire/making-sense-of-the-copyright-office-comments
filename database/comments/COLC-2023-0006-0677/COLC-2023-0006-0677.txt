AI generated content should not be protected under copyright law. AI content uses content from unassuming artists and writers and for that generated content to then be able to be copyrighted doesn&rsquo;t really work because it&rsquo;s infringing on the artists and writers who made the original pieces the AI is using. I also think that prompting an AI to write or draw something is not the same thing creatively as writing or drawing something yourself.
