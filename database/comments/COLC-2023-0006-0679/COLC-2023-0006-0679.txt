I feel it is absolutely critical that the copyright issues involving AI be resolved as swiftly as possible, and in a way that makes it clear that purely AI generated products, as opposed to those that simply use AI as a tool in the toolbox that is then transformed substantiatively into something else, cannot be copyrighted as they had no true concious human involvement.<br/><br/>I personally also feel that it should be legal to sue for copyright infringement those AI that utilized non-public-domain works without the explicit permission of their authors and owners for the usage in training AI.<br/><br/>AI is an incredibly powerful tool, but it should be one that is created ethically.
