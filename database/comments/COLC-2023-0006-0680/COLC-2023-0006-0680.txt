Work created by AI should not be protected by copyright. AI creates work by stealing from human creations. AI needs to be regulated, not protected as it currently is being used to pilfer copyrighted works and stifle creativity. If you allow AI copyright protections not only will it result in millions of creators losing money and jobs, it will take away one of the last things humans have... Creativity and art. We need to be protecting humans, not computers.
