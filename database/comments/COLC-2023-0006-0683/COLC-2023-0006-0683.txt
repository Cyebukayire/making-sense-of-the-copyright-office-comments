My name is Breeze Grigas, director of Zephyr Workshop. I am a business owner in a creative industry - I create and publish tabletop board games and card games. The nature of this work requires a lot of illustrations, graphic design, and written prose and thus AI has become a hot topic in my industry. A majority of AI-generated work is built from programs like Midjourney, which only function via the unauthorized use of copyrighted works. While it&#39;s possible to create a generator that uses legally sourced materials, there is no way to police this. Thus, all AI-generated outputs should not be able to hold a copyright. The volume and ease of output from these applications would also open the door to infinite instances of copyright troll lawsuits - all you have to do is generate millions of pieces of art, text, or music under your copyright in mere minutes and wait for someone to produce something similar. AI is being astroturfed by bad actors on social media, mostly Silicon valley tech and cryptocurrency enthusiasts who want this as the end goal. It stands to damage every creative industry and put an undue burden on artists, writers, and musicians forever if their work can freely and simply be blended into billions of new pieces and legally protected at the push of a button. Don&#39;t let it happen.
