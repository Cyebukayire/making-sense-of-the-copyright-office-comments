AI &quot;art&quot; I dont believe can be copyrighted as it stands right now as AI art is merely generative from already copyrighted art often from art that did not consent to being put into these generators to be used. They are not creating anything new, merely editing others artwork often without the consent or knowledge of the original artists they are stealing from.
