While there is definitely very much in the AI/machine learning space that can be very useful to industries that DOESN&#39;T harm people, AI/machine learning that is generative poses a fundamental threat to humans, not in that it will rise up and kill people like tech leaders like to pretend, but in the sense that leaders of industry want to use it to eliminate humans from creative spaces to hoard more wealth for themselves at every level; they do not care that machines would make our culture, our art, the things we enjoy and make us people. <br/>The adoption of generative AI would create fundamental competition with human workers and creators, creating even MORE wealth disparity via lost income, robs artists of their work (and fair compensation for their work), violates the privacy of everyone who ever shared a photo or piece of writing on the internet, and waters down a valuable export of the US economy, which is our entertainment industry THAT IS MADE SO SUCCESSFUL BY HUMANS. <br/>DON&#39;T LET BIG TECH AND CEOS FORCE OUR ART TO BE MADE FROM MACHINES THAT GROUND UP OUR WORK AND SPAT IT OUT AGAIN.<br/>We the people should be able to make informed decisions about how AI effects our lives, not just have it run roughshod over us because the wealthy leaders of industry want to cement their positions as modern robber barons. It is not sustainable. Regulate generative AI in ways that benefit the average human and nor corporations bottom line.
