AI is a huge problem in my career. I work for a publishing company and we frequently buy stock art for our book covers, but stock art sites are utterly infested with AI art. This is stolen art that we do not want to use, but it appears indistinguishable from real art. Similarly, our authors are having their copyright infringed by people feeding their life&rsquo;s work into AI. It could not be a greater problem and should be seriously restricted in use
