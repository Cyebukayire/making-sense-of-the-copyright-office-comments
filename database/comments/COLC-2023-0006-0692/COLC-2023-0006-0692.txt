AI &quot;art&quot; is not copyright able as it is not human made and therefore unable to qualify as art. The Supreme Court has weighed in before and that precedent should be upheld. It should also be noted that AI &quot;art&quot; is just an amalgation of art that DOES often contain valid copyrights and steps on the toes of artists everywhere. It is not the correct use for AI in our world.
