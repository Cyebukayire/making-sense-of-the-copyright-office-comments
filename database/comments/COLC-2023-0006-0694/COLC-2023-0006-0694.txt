Hello. As an author I am deeply concerned for the way machine learning and AI currently is being trained off of books like mine without any reimbursement and I believe that is tantamount to copyright infringement, if not outright theft. People will say the AI is merely learning off my work, but AI doesn&rsquo;t learn like people. It doesn&rsquo;t take art and sit with it and reinterpret it - it copies. It&rsquo;s not a full xerox, but it is rote, mechanical mimicry of style and concepts. Art is all about voice - the voice of an artist determines what makes a piece special. There are countless paintings of women in dark dresses, but Madame X and The Mona Lisa are special because of their painters voices. Literature is the same. Money Dick and the Old Man and the Sea are both stories of men fishing - but scale, characterization, and voice are what makes them different and special. A machine cannot create its own voice. It must be trained to imitate. And in doing so, it steals. <br/><br/>In the UK, the government is forcing AI creators to reveal what works their bots have been trained on. Many have said they will stop selling their programs in the UK because of that, because it would,open the, up to lawsuits. They know it is theft. They know they are violating copyright. I never consented for my works to be used as a basis for a machine to imitate. It should be made illegal to use any work of art - writing, painting, and all the rest - as a training material for an AI without the artists consent. It should be a violation of copyright. Let them train AI on the public domain, if needed. <br/><br/>Additionally, while I believe actual programming of machine learning should be able to be copyrighted, the works made by machines should not be. At least not until the machine that created it has citizenship. Using an AI to create a work is not the same as using a brush. With a brush you must study how to paint. An AI doesn&rsquo;t study, it merely copies. <br/><br/>So I urge you please again to make the works of AI un-copyrightable, and make the training of AI using copyrighted works illegal without the original creators consent. It&rsquo;s what is fair to artists. Machines are not people. They do not have a voice. All they can do is echo, and an echo is owes everything to the sound it follows. Thank you.
