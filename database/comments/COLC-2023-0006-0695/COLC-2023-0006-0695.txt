As an artist, I see AI as predatory to my work and the work of others like me because often these algorithms are trained on artworks of other people. This means even though AI artworks are created by a computer, they take advantage of artists working on their own personal projects or projects not connected to the AI in the first place. I firmly believe AI art to be a major breach of copyright and I do not want these technologies forced upon me and my peers in the future. AI artwork is plagiarism.
