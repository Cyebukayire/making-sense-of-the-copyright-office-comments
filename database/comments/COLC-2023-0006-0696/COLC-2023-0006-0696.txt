There are several problems with AI-generated material.<br/><br/>1) it is trained on and therefore uses copyrighted material without permission, using skimmed material.<br/><br/>2) as a result of this, what it generates is essentially a knockoff of protected works<br/><br/>3) this include images of real people, since it is trained on photos of real people, who have not given consent. This is a violation of privacy.<br/><br/>4) textually, what it generates is often harmfully incorrect<br/><br/>Corrective measures should include that AIs may only be trained on material provided with permission, that no AI-generated material can be copyrighted, that any AI found to be using copyrighted material in training be liable, and that it may not be trained on photos of real people without explicit permission given by the SUBJECT for photos to be used in AI training. That means that street scenes, for example, would not be an option without the written permission of every individual pictured. Finally, AI should also be required to ensure that factual inquiries are provided with genuinely factual responses.<br/><br/>Widespread use of AI will negatively affect creative output, causing economic harm to the entertainment industry. It will also cause problems academically, with students relying on a faulty service to create plagiarized papers, which will further burn out teachers and administrators. Speaking as a teacher, it takes at least two hours, minimum, to deal with a single instance of plagiarizing. It will take even longer to deal with one that&#39;s AI generated where half the sources are made up and none of the information is accurate. I agree that AI can be useful for generating things like form emails and other generic writing samples, but overall, I think the negative impacts vastly outweigh the positive impacts.
