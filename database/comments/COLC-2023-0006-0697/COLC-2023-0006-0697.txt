This technology is moving too fast for our current regulations. I am a creative. I am a Storyteller and actor. Right now this technology can duplicate me and make it sound like I said whatever the programmer/prompt tells them. <br/><br/>Companies absolutely should not be able to use AI generated ANYTHING to create anything they can copyright and own. Corporations are not PEOPLE. <br/><br/>Furthermore, we should intrinsically hold copyright to our likeness and voice, and it should not be possible to sign away that copyright broadly and in perpetuity. <br/><br/>It should be regulated to a limited amount of time and we should be able to consent and be compensated at the time someone wants to use our likeness or voice. <br/><br/>This tech will out pace us more quickly than we can imagine... it already is. Regulation needs to happen NOW.<br/><br/>At bare minimum we need to codify that HUMANS own their own likeness, and the work we create. Not a corporation.  Not a machine.
