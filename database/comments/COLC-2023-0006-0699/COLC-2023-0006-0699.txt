AI is plagiarism. AI is theft. Artists and creatives work hard and deserve to share their work without an inescapable threat of AI scraping and stealing their creation.  To create is one of the most sacred, personal parts of being human and corporations and capitalists should not be allowed to utilize AI to steal artists creations so they can get around properly compensating artists for their work. (As they are likely underpaying and exploiting many of the people being their AI tech as well.) Artists and creatives deserve robust protections from AI. It already feels like the situation is snowballing, don&#39;t let it get out of control. Set limits, protections, and consequences NOW.
