&ldquo;Artwork&rdquo; generated by AI is nothing more than theft from real artists. There isn&rsquo;t a single original element involved. <br/><br/>As an analogy. If I go to a convention and pay an artist for a commission of Superman and Batman dancing a tango under a blood moon in Monaco, and the artist provides exactly what I saw in my mind&rsquo;s eye - I am still not the artist and cannot file for copyright protection absent very specific legal conditions. Likewise, unless the AI platforms license each and every work they use to train their algorithms, and the end user then reaches appropriate legal agreements with the platform and the artists, they should have no ability to claim copyright protection. To the contrary, they should be subject to liability if they try to use what they stole for commercial purposes.
