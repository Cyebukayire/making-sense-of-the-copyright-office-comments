AI is completely unethical for any person and or company to profit from. It would be off the back of hard working artists who will be exploited by the nature of the technology scraping existing art to make a new product. This process does not merit being protected under and influence or remix clause due to a massive lack of human input beyond a prompt. Please consider new laws on how AI can be used and do not wait for it to take jobs from trained artists in any field.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Gary Trimarchi
