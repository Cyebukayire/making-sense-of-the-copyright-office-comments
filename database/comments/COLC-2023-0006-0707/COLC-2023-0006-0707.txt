Copyright should only be applied to content created by a human (with or without the assistance of a computer).<br/><br/>Electronic music can be arranged, edited, and composed by a human, and should be protected. Audio that is algorithmically generated should not.<br/><br/>Digital art and animation, similarly, can be composed, directed, and created by humans. But the idea that anything created solely by a computer should be protected is absurd. There needs to be a distinguishing difference between something Generated by a computer and something Created by a person.
