I have several concerns when it comes to AI, especially deep fakes and the use of copyrighted content to create AI content. <br/><br/>Regarding deepfakes, this technology is here and it is excellent. I have seen full replicas of our politicians giving speeches they have never given. We have a historic election year coming up and we need you all to do something before it hits. I promise you, no matter the political affiliation, the amount of fake information that will flood the internet will be absolutely catastrophic for this country.<br/><br/>As an actor, i am very concerned about how my image is used. My likeness belongs to me.  And yet random people can use generators to input my face and my work and create something I had no part in. Studios want to own my likeness in perpetuity and never pay me again.  This is incredibly scary and concerning. Please help us fight and put legislation in place that would prevent companies from using our likenesses without consent.
