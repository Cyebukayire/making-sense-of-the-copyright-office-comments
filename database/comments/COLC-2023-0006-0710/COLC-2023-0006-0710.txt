I do not support the use of generative artificial intelligence, nor do I believe that anything produced by it should be copyrightable. It is, at its very core, a device that steals other people&rsquo;s work and then attempts to pass it off as its own. If a human were to do that, it would be called plagiarism.<br/><br/>I fear that the use of generative artificial intelligence will negatively affect the creativity and imagination of people worldwide. Without having to think and create on their own, people will lose their ingenuity, and the human race&rsquo;s progress in any sort of advancement will stagnate.<br/><br/>I am also concerned about how dangerous unrestricted generative artificial intelligence could be. We have already seen that the programs will create false court cases. What is to stop them from creating false history, or false historical figures? Or perhaps false information regarding edible plants, or diseases, or weather patterns. Unrestricted generative artificial intelligence could put millions of lives in danger.
