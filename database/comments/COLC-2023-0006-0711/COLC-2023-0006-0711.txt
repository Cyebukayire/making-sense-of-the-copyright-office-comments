Okay think of this way government people. Imagine if someone took all of your important government work and they throw it into a blender. After they blend up all your important work they then dump it out and start taking letters from random government stuff and joining them into a document. During this process no thought has been put into the important government document. It just smashed a bunch of similar government documents together. For example, imagine of the declaration of Independence was just a bunch of other declarations about other countries declarations squished together. No one would take that seriously and there P would have been no independence for us.
