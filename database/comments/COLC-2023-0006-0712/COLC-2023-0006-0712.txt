AI-generated works should accurately cite the source(s) they pull from. Also, the consent of artists, authors, and other creators should be required before their works can be scraped for usage by artificial intelligence. Companies that own artificial intelligence image generators should be considered guilty of plagiarism if they profit from mimicking the style of an artist without the artist&#39;s explicit consent to the practice.
