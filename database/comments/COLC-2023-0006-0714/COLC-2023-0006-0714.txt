AI or Generative Algorithm based works cannot be considered original works in any way shape or form. not only does the nature of the medium require other works in order to exist, it is also nearly impossible to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the AI or Generative Algorithm was only trained on public domain or licensed materials.<br/>as an artist i can confidently say that i will never use an AI or Generative Algorithm to generate any sort of art, it is theft, a violation of privacy and certain human rights in many cases, and not worth the possible repurcussions.<br/>copyright law should protect artists, not machines that steal artist&#39;s work.
