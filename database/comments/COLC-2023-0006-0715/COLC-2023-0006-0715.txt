I feel that AI is infringing on many many copyrights as it trolls the internet gobbling up and learning what it finds to use as fodder for it&rsquo;s own creations all of which are based on and in cases using parts of or whole works which have copyright protections afforded it/them by the US copyright law. The law must be enforced to the fullest extent when it comes to Artificial Intelligence.
