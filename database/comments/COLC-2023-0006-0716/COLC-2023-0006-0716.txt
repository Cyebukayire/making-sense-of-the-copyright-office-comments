I think Artificial intelligence should not be allowed to use already created and copyrighted works to &quot;create&quot; it&#39;s own works. If it is allowed, it should have to pay royalties to whoever originally created the works it is using as a &quot;reference&quot; since those people actually put time and effort into making their product. Anything that comes from AI should also not be allowed copyright protections since it is breaking other works copyrights. Also social media companies should not be able to sell their users art for training in AI art data pools, since the companies don&#39;t have the original copyright that the creator has.
