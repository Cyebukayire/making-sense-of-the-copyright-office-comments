Works that are subject to copyright need to have a significant and direct human element in their creation. It is one thing if AI is used as a tool to help springboard art and help create quick concepts to better convey what is being asked for, but that concept must be refined by a human hand in the end (and by a significant amount). AI is merely a tool, but it should never be a replacement for actual work done by actual people.
