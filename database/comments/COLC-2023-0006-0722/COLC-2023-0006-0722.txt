Artificial intelligence walks all over existing copyright laws like they&#39;re about as useful as wet tissue paper on a speedway. Not only does it violate the inherent copyright of creators internationally, it is trained using stolen data gathered by scraping the internet of any images the owners of the AI can get their grubby little hands on. And that&#39;s not even talking about copyrighted writing, that google is scraping off their own drive program!
