I am one for, new things that HELP. I do not appreciate new things that HURT AND STEAL. I cannot put into words how long it took me to write my very first script. And I would rather burn it in a fireplace than not have living people that can actually express the emotions on screen at times better than I did when I put pen to paper. I never understood the unrelentless need to remove the most moving of things. I still love listening to vinyl records over streaming the music. There is something about the sound of the needle on the record, and hearing those first few months of it playing before your favorite song starts, that brings you back, to that first song you met your first crush, first love, first fight, first everything.  Music and cinema have that power to bring you back to when things you forgot. And only a HUMAN BEING can do that...it doesn&#39;t matter if it is live action or voice over talent. Nothing beats RAW HUMAN EMOTION. nothing. I got into this bc I watched my godparents just dominate the screen. And I loved it. I wanted to learn everything about it. Not just in front of the camera...behind it as well. Wanted to be a part of a family that at times loves and understands you lore than your own. I know I&#39;m small, couldn&#39;t tell you where I land on the alphabet of which list I am as far as celebrity status. But I know, keeping things the way they are, as far as NO A.I. is a small request in the big scheme things. Now if someone requests to have A.I. opposed to C.G. for their character due to an untimely passing,  I completely understand that. BUT ONLY IF THEY REQUESTED.  A.I. just isn&#39;t it. You won&#39;t get that emotion. That powerful monologs that holds you. Thank you for allowing me to ramble about my love for this industry.  And I pray I get the same amount of years with it my godparents did.
