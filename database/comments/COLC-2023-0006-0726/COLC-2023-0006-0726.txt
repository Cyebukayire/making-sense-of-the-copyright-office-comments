AI, as a tool, should be regulated to not risk denying meaningful work for human beings. In concept, a helping hand from AI can benefit in the production of materials, both physical and digital, but AI should not be allowed to progress beyond concept-stages of development in any field as it endangers the livelihoods of human beings and their contributions to society. Even more so, AI unethically dances on the line of fraud, as many have used it for manipulation and abuse to unfairly take away opportunities from creative workers and mimic styles without proper consent or compensation to the original feeds their AI draws their information and creation from. In order to protect workers and continue creating art ethically, AI must be heavily regulated and should only be allowed in concept and aid with heavy scrutiny of final product publication. As it stands, copyright is automatically created upon creation in any creative work made by humans. AI can only learn from already created works and cannot create products from nothing, so to feed it at all should require full consent and come with fair compensation for mimicking copyrighted content.
