AI could become a powerful tool for us all to utilize. AI can empower the working class and allow us to enjoy life more freely without the constant piling of work on our shoulders. However, until it is controlled, it will run rampant and only harm us all. AI is only as smart and as creative as whatever it is being fed. It should not be fed with stolen art and content from artists trying to make ends meet, only to see their art being made by an AI in a hollow attempt to create what humanity can already do on their own. Please do not let AI turn into another tool used by the rich to keep the working class and the rest of humanity down. Let it become what it was meant to be: a tool for us ALL.
