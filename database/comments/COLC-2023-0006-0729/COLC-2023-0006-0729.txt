Language models, art generators, and the (currently experimental) video generators which are named &quot;AI&quot; are trained by exposure to data sets. In order for an AI to produce coherent, cogent, and lifelike results, those data sets must be language OR artwork OR video produced by real humans. In the case of most of the dominant &quot;AI&quot; available on the internet today, these data sets were produced by &quot;scraping,&quot; the process of moving from one webpage to the next in search of publicly available information--I stress, publicly available, but NOT COPYRIGHT FREE. <br/><br/>As a result, it seems apparent right out of the gate that these &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; models cannot produce material that can be copyrighted. Just because material is publicly available, does not mean its owners no longer have the right to it. And &quot;AI&quot; is not like an artist. It cannot produce an original work. If it produces a drawing of an orange, that drawing is inexorably and inextricably linked to all the other (likely copyrighted) pieces of art which the AI learned from. <br/><br/>As a consumer of art, and a producer of writing and digital artwork, I cannot overstate how strongly I oppose even the idea of &quot;AI&quot; generated content being allowed anything even approaching copyright, because &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; as it now stands cannot create--it can only reproduce what it has seen. <br/><br/>Anything an AI makes cannot be copyrighted. Anything made by an AI ought to be ipso facto non-restricted public domain unless modified significantly (arbitrary number, modified by 50% or more) by a human. Further, there must be some way for humans to &quot;opt out&quot; of inclusion in AI training data sets. There should be significant financial and potential civil penalties for companies who trawl the web indiscriminately to rob from writers and artists around the world. Thank you for your time, and please make the right decision to ensure that future generations will be able not only to create, but to envision a life as creators. <br/>
