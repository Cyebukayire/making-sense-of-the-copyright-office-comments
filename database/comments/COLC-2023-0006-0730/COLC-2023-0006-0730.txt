I believe that a human being has their perspective created over their lifetime by many factors that I believe should be obvious. If an entity can use already copyrighted material in anyway during it&rsquo;s learning phase or production period I believe that it is illegal,illegitimate in authenticity and strips the copyrighted artist,writer, etc of their unique perspective that was earned by their living their life. I believe that this is also infringement on their civil rights and liberties.
