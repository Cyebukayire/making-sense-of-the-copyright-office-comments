I believe that not only should art and writing, immediately be given copyrighted protections automatically to protect both from AI, but that it should be illegal for anyone to use AI to create art or writing or people&#39;s voices if the artist/writer/person in question whose voice it is hasn&#39;t explicitly stated in detail that they&#39;ve given permission for anything created by themselves to be used for AI. AI can cause irreparable harm to the livelihoods of actors, singers, writers, and artists by creating content similar to theirs in the form of written, visual, and auditory media, which is why it is important to make it illegal for anyone to use AI for such a purpose. It would cost innocent people whose skills and hard work were put into making stuff their livelihoods, the ability to earn a living to support themselves and their families, and would result in complete economic chaos if strict laws on AI use are not immediately created. There should be heavy fines implemented for anyone who uses AI to create any kind of work by anyone who has not explicitly given permission for their works to be used by AI, and there should be laws implemented making it illegal for anyone to profit off of AI works to prevent people from utilizing AI to make a profit by claiming that music, art, voice recordings, etc., were made by a person when it in fact was not and instead was using their actual work to create something similar in style. Furthermore, individual artists/writers/voice actors who make art and literature and voice recordings for fun should also automatically be granted protections from having their creations be used by AI. They should be granted the same protections as people who create any kind of media for profit with hard work and without the use of AI, to prevent anyone from trying to profit off of any kind of media made by those who create media without AI use for fun. It is important to ensure that AI cannot be utilized to recreate any kind of media from any person without that person&#39;s explicit permission to prevent widespread theft of art styles and irreparable harm to the economy and to the rights of individual people as a whole, and to ensure that AI doesn&#39;t kill potential media creators&#39; future careers by attempting to use their creations to fuel AI bots and profit off of them without the media creator&#39;s knowledge and ruining their careers before they&#39;ve even begun- as well as violate that person&#39;s right to protect their works of media they created with their own two hands and without the use of AI.
