I don&#39;t think those who use AI to generate images, text, or other media should be able to claim to hold the copyright to such AI-generated works unless they can positively prove they hold the copyrights to all works used in training the artificial intelligence, especially if the generated work is generated to replicate the voice, person, or artistic style of a specific individual.
