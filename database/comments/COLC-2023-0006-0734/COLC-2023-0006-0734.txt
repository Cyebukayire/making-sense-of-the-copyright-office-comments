AI should NOT be used to disempower creatives or devalue and eliminate human creation &amp; creativity. Art and culture were one of the first creations in our history aside from language, it cannot be stated enough how bad it is to let human expression be overtaken by machines just to aid companies in their quest for bigger profit margins. AI CAN be beneficial but not in the way it&#39;s currently being used, weaponized against the larger public against their will with only a *few* who truly benefit, &quot;Big Tech&quot; shouldn&#39;t be making the final decision on our lives, cultures, and arts. Aside from human creativity and value being under threat, there&#39;s also tons of cases of THEFT going on with this emerging technology (generative AI) that&#39;s continuously brushed off under the guise of &quot;progress&quot;, tons of authors, voice actors, musicians and artists have given personal accounts of their work stolen and unwillingly used in these companies&#39; data sets and appropriate action needs to be taken. For every artist that goes out business Sam Altman and Mark Zuckerberg get a new house.<br/>To let these companies/parties act with impunity would be a failure on this country and our regulatory body.<br/><br/>The ideological vision some have of a &quot;fully automated society&quot; is one that is antithetical to the human experience and purpose, if art and culture are used to tell &quot;The Human Story&quot; why is it being told by something that isn&#39;t human?<br/><br/>Laws are implemented after careful consideration, drug companies can&#39;t just sell a product without regulatory oversight, missiles aren&#39;t tested in the middle of New York City......what makes OpenAI, Stable Diffusion, and Meta so different? they *cannot* be allowed to upend and railroad society like this.<br/><br/>Please, be on the right side of history and act accordingly.
