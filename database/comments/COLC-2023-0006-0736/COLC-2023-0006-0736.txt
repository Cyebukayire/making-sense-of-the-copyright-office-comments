Generative AI and the machine-learning algorithms that power them are technology that has rapidly advanced over the past several years. My personal interests are especially focused on the image-generation and text-generation fields of application but there are countless uses for this technology that will be discovered and refined over the coming years and decades. Any restrictions on this field must be light-handed and extremely focused to prevent the absolute worst uses of the technology while not stifling innovation. The United States will be one of the primary leaders in this field but only if we do not prohibit the free and open research and development of these models.<br/><br/>Concerns about copyright and IP infringement are overblown and emboldened by the same type of fear-mongering that comes with any technological advancement that threatens to create upheaval in the capitalist workflow. While there may be some needed guidance to prevent direct nearly-identical works from being created, this is no different than making it clearly illegal to trace someone&#39;s work and then sell it. Most of these machine learning algorithms and the way they function can be much more closely compared to the way a human being learns; particularly image generation, where different models refined from different datasets all &quot;learn&quot; what a given word means and what an image of that word looks like.<br/><br/>I strongly advocate for as light a touch as possible, with legal preference and the benefit of the doubt being given to the creators of generative AI where possible - the tools that are being created now will result in a massive explosion of creativity and produced works of literary and visual art.
