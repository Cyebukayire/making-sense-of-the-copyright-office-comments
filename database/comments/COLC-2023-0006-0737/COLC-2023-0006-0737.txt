AI is not original content. It takes from already existing work (whether images or text) and most often without permission. To allow it to be copyrightable is almost a contradiction, in my eyes. A particular way an AI works could be copyrightable, the technology of it, but what it creates should not be. The focus right now should be on protecting individuals from having their work stolen to feed an AI, not protecting the AI.
