AI has taken the world by storm and I think it has the potential to do so much good. AI also has the potential to destroy so many things we all hold close to our hearts. Our favorite books were written by humans, people who express and emote and FEEL. People who have experiences, real and true. People who have wild and beautiful imagination and can dream of the big beautiful worlds we immerse ourselves in. This can be said for theatre, film, television&hellip; all art! We have to regulate what is deemed art, true art. We have to place boundaries on the new technologies before we cannot go back. Taking the livelihood of others, those who survive off of the hard work they produce. Those whose bodies and voices provide us with the entertainment we love, those who are so immensely talented they bring a tear to your eye or make you laugh in the darkest of times. We MUST protect that. We cannot let AI ruin the entertainment industry. We cannot let AI ruin the book industry. We cannot let AI replace humanity.
