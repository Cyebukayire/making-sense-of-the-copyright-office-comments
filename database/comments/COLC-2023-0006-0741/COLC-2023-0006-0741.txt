Please:<br/>--DO NOT allow AI to hold copyright unless an actual human artist can demonstrate that they have made significant alterations to the source artwork, much the way artists must demonstrate significant alteration in order to use the work of others in their own now. The fact that that alteration happens through the use of a machine that obfuscates connection with the original is not a good enough reason to ignore the original creator&#39;s work.<br/>--DO NOT allow anyone to copyright work done &quot;in the style of&quot; an existing artist or using voices/performance of living actors, especially ones whose work is still under copyright, as it violates the integrity of that artist&#39;s work and their ability to make a living off their own skills<br/>--DO create a solid, viable system for artists and other performers to remove/block their work from being used in machine learning as well as a method to test if that opt-out was ignored and prosecute those responsible<br/>--DO focus primarily on creating systems that meet the needs of individual artists and protect them from corporate conglomerates<br/>--DO hold programmers responsible for the harm their programs do to individual artists, especially when it&#39;s quite obvious that the program would be used to harm those artists
