AI and its use have been on the rise as of late, and it has concerned many, myself included. It is considered to be put to use to replace human labor, especially in creative fields, like writing and art (which is a big reason why the SAG AFTRA strike is still ongoing). I myself am a growing artist, and while I don&#39;t have fear that AI will fully replace me, I don&#39;t want to live in a future where it actually does. For other people, however, AI is being used to replace them and their work, actively harming them and even putting their lives at risk. The other main issue with AI is that it relies on stolen work: AI &quot;art&quot; always needs existing references of characters and how they&#39;re depicted in order to &quot;draw&quot; them; it needs existing writing work to know how to write a script. This work being scraped is almost always not obtained with consent from the original creator/author, and is effectively stealing their work and violating any form of copyright. A good example of this is Google apparently on its way to scrape everything users do with their services for AI training: YouTube videos, Google Docs documents, Google Drive files, etc. This is an invasion of privacy not properly announced by Google, and it should not be allowed to be even done. AI is an attempt to replace human labor and even humanity, all for the sake of earning more money (that might not even be used)
