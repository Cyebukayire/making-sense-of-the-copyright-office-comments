As an artist, I believe it should be considered copyright infringement for a person to &lsquo;teach&rsquo; an AI using art that doesn&rsquo;t belong to them. It&rsquo;s similar to photocopying a photograph that somebody else took, and saying that the machine made that photo, simply because it &lsquo;created&rsquo; a photo.
