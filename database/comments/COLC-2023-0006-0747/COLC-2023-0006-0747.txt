I do not believe that copyright should be granted to non-humans for their &ldquo;creations.&ldquo; I believe that AI systems are &ldquo;creating&ldquo; based upon text they have been trained on which has been created by people or other AI systems. I believe that a true creation is something that only a human can do. Everything else is programmed and not created.
