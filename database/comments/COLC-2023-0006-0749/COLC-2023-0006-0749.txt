I feel as though the term &ldquo;AI&rdquo; is very loose currently, but if we&rsquo;re defining it as content created by a computer/program that has been fed a sample set to base its answers/produced results off of, without the consent or compensation of the original creators of that sample set, I think that &ldquo;new&rdquo; content should not be allowed to be copyrighted. It is stealing from the original creators and damaging the value of their work already, but to allow some dude who typed in a prompt to then copyright the plagiarized result feels like it would mean the death of all creative jobs. Horrible for the economy, not to mention the human spirit. And AI generated voice and image content is already being used to scam and mislead people. I certainly don&rsquo;t think we should be allowing those people to copyright clones of people&rsquo;s voices and likenesses.
