AI Art models can create a facsimile of an artist&#39;s work, effectively stealing their labor from them, simply by adding the artist&#39;s name as a tag. The reason this is possible is because the AI art model is usually trained using that artist&#39;s work.<br/><br/>Additionally, AI art and AI writing is usually of much lower quality than art and writing created by a human; all you have to do is look at an AI model try to draw hands, or noodles, or anything with fiddly details.
