What the modern technological industry calls &#39;AI&#39; is not AI - it is a complicated algorithm designed to copy commonly occurring elements of work it is given access to and emulate them in requested output.  This is not a toy - unscrupulous users allow their copy of this algorithm to search massive online repositories of art, sounds, and voices, and then it reviews these for commonly occurring elements and copies them into requested output.  This usage is not restricted to unscrupulous individuals either, it is being engaged in by corporations, businesses, and the industries involved to copy from works that they do not have legal permission to copy from, in order to emulate those elements and avoid paying artists, musicians and actors for their work.  This should not be legally permitted - this use of &#39;AI&#39; is harmful to every human, creative individual and is an existential threat to their ability to maintain their livelihood.  It is an existential threat to all future creatives&#39; ability to maintain a livelihood. Please do not permit this unscrupulous and misleading use of technology for shortsighted profit, the human cost would be incalculable.
