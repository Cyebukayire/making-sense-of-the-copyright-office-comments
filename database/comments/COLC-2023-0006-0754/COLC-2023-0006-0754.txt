Hello,<br/>It&#39;s hard to make a living as an artist, but we need art in order to nourish the soul of the country. I believe it&#39;s possible to encourage both arts and tech here, but to do so artists must be compensated fairly, and copyright is a tool to gather that fair compensation.<br/><br/>Allowing tech companies to use artists&#39; work without reasonable compensation will harm arts and culture production in the US, perhaps irrevocably.<br/><br/>If tech companies must patronize artists for their work, both tech and the arts may flourish: a viable arts career could be producing work for AI training.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read this comment.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Kyle Haas
