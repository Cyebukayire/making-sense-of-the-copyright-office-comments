Copyright should not be given to works that are created by machine learning software. They derive their work from statistical associations based on their training data, which may be work that is already copyrighted by someone else, and may have been collected without their permission. To allow the use of copyrighted works without permission to create other work that is then copyrighted is simply indirect plagiarism, and removes incentives for creators to produce their own original works. It would be deeply unfair to allow work based on copyrighted work that was taken without permission to be copyrighted itself, and then compete with the work that it was derived from.
