The remarkable thing about humans are they are extremely creative, and humans have created countless works of art in many different forms. Everything a person creates is fundamentally unique from what another person creates, unless someone creates a copy of their work. And that is why we have Copyright laws. AI are trained off existing material and right now they can&#39;t produce works of art comparable to humans, but in theory one day they should be. Yet, AI truly can not innovate and if humans are pushed out of the field of creating art by mass amounts of AI generated content, then there will be no truly new and original content, and all art will stagnate, with AI unable to evolve the field itself. So, the Copyright Office should promote regulations that ensure that the rights to works remain with the original human that created them, and that any AI material, in order to be copyrightable, should be genuinely transformed by a human in that process. AI just create remixed works of art based on existing ones. At the very base of what it is, it is just copying the works of others, and such copied work should not be granted copyright protections under US Law. Thank you for your consideration of this comment.
