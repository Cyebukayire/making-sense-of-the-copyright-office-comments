The issue of AI regulation is a hot-button topic, and frankly a difficult one to regulate- artificial intelligence systems are only now truly becoming able to replicate human words and artwork, and as a result are using works made by human artists without their permission, scouring the internet for training data- much in the same way that human artists learn by watching and replicating other people&#39;s artwork. In the short-term, making it illegal to claim AI art as your own copyright when it&#39;s using human-made art as its basis is depriving artists, authors, and other creatives of their efforts so someone else can make money off of it without so much as a notice, but in the long-term, this and the wordings of the law mean that any non-human entities- whether artificial or alien in origin- cannot legally copyright their own work under US law, which is a violation of these potential beings&#39; rights and opens the door for future abuses of a far greater scope than AI generative artwork, writing, and other creative media can accomplish, not to mention depriving human creatives from learning to make art using references and sketches as well as artificial intelligence-generated voices and images of famous people saying things they never would have endorsed, let alone done.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t have an answer for this, but I think the best solution for now is to keep artificial intelligence learning legal, but make an individual&#39;s image and voice part of their own personal rights and make it illegal for AI to directly use a real person&#39;s voice or image (including actors acting out a role) without their explicit consent.
