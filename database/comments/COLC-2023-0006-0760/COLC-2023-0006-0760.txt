I do not believe that work(s) created by Artificial Intelligence whether solely created or with the assistance of a person(s) should ever be considered eligible for copyright protections of any kind. Works created by Artificial Intelligence have been trained on the works of others from both the public domain and still copyrighted materials. Most owners of these Artificial Intelligence models are not able to disclose/will not disclose how they have trained these A.I. models.
