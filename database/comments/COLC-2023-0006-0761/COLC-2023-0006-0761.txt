One could argue that these generators being passed off as artificial intelligence aren&#39;t inherently dangerous. The companies that create the technology insist that it exists to simplify creative labor, not replace the creative working class. They didn&#39;t ask their generators to &quot;write&quot; a book on foraging without checking that the &quot;edible&quot; mushrooms could be eaten more than once and selling it for profit. But one cannot argue that this technology works by &quot;analyzing&quot; text and images created by actual sentient beings. One can&#39;t deny that the technology is &quot;trained&quot; on art and literature without permission or compensation. <br/><br/>Writers and artists are already exploited enough by corporate shareholders who wouldn&#39;t know creativity if it bit them on the nose. I&#39;m sure this office is aware of the labor disputes in the film industry; their grievances are only the tip of the iceberg in what sort of garbage these massive conglomerates do to get out of paying their workers a single cent more than they have to. They&#39;ve been doing it for decades. It&#39;s the norm. But these generators are new technology. We don&#39;t have to follow the same norms of laissez faire capitalism that have served us so poorly all these years.<br/><br/>You in this office have a chance to stop these tech companies from stealing our work, our words, and our art. I truly hope you take it.<br/><br/>Help us, U.S. Copyright Office. You&#39;re our only hope.
