Hello to who it may concern. I come to you today to tell my views on AI in filmmaking. I personally believe that using AI to use the likeness of actors without their knowledge, depriving those perhaps already struggling to scrape by of work, and perhaps putting them in a movie that they do not want to be in, is unethical. I think similarly with the use of AI in writing and vfx. I hope that you will listen to the experiences of those who work in the film industry and aren&rsquo;t incredibly successful, as they are the most affected by laws around AI. Whether they will be affected for better or for worse, is up to you.
