Ai generated work should not be available to copyright.<br/><br/>Copyright laws work to control ownership, use, and distribution of creative and expressive works. In this economic story about copyright, people think that most creators make their creative works so that they can get paid. When copyright enables creators to get paid, more creators make more works.<br/><br/>Creators of original works- artists, authors, musicians, designers, and more- are having that work stolen from the internet, used to train machines that produce pastiche work in their style, which the generators of this pastiche hope to sell at a fraction of the original creators&rsquo; cost.<br/><br/>Regardless of the ethics of its sourcing, Ai created, copyrighted work will destroy this incentive for original creators to create by destroying their ability to get paid for their work.<br/><br/>In respect to the ethics of its sourcing, if Ai generators are able to steal copyrighted original work in order to produce similar or derivative work, which it then copyrights and sells, this seems clearly in violation of if not the letter then certainly the spirit of the original copyright law.<br/><br/>Thank you for protecting creators and the arts by ensuring that copyright remains exclusive to genuinely human-originating works.
