It&rsquo;s entirely unethical to consider AI &ldquo;created&rdquo; works as original or worthy of copyright. Copyright should be reserved only for works of media by people, where a person&rsquo;s experiences, training, and imagination are on display. AI works are &ldquo;created&rdquo; only by stealing data from truly original works while giving no recognition or credit to the creators of said original works. Making AI and AI creations protected under US law will only lead to continued devaluation of the work of real people, decreasing jobs, and hurting the American people the law is meant to protect. Do not legitimize an industry built of theft.
