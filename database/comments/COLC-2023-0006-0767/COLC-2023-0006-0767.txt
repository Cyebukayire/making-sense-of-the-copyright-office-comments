Thank you for inviting comments from the public. <br/>For my part, I strongly believe AI works should not be copyrightable now or at any point in the future, and in any way. Furthermore there must be stringent controls put on and penalties applied whenever an AI LLM or similar is found to have generated material from existing copyrighted material without due recognition / payment. <br/>We MUST protect our creativity as a species. Our ability to tell ourselves stories - the thing that has helped us make sense of our world and our place in it since we first began communicating with one another. I firmly believe that without this, we will begin to see irredeemable cracks form in society and our humanity - and a dissolution of what it means to be human. <br/>We must listen to those who preach caution, comprehension and a &#39;human-first&#39; perspective. Those who seek to make money off AI and LLMs have a clear vested interest and organisations like this have, throughout history, been proven time and time again to put profit ahead of what&#39;s good for our species. <br/>Thanks again, <br/>Alistair Hudson
