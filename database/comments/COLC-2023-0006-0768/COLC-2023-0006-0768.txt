The federal government and therefore, copyright office, exists to protect the interests of the citizens of the United States.<br/><br/>Your first general question is a simple one to answer.<br/><br/>Citizens are persons. AI infrastructure is property that generates output that if created by a person, would be a form of property. It can do so in a way that can generate almost any form of output in any format in such a way that can eliminate the ability for most human generators of output to gain copyright, through generation of literally any number of variations of output &#39;blocking in&#39; the innovation of humans. The copyright office has seen this many, many times when individuals and corporations have derived intellectual property rights of discrete, small endeavors that uniquely &#39;build&#39; on the creations of others, stifling innovation. Look back into your own experience during the silly efforts made during the &#39;Dot Com&#39; era of frivolous patents, such as &#39;how to swing a cat.&#39;<br/><br/>Output then from AI should then, lack copyright protection. There already exists methods to determine if, say, something is a unique enough variation on something which is copyright free or public domain, that is transformative enough to become protected.<br/><br/>If a human then, can demonstrate that they&#39;ve transformed the output of AI comparative to this, only then would the human output be subject to any form of protection.
