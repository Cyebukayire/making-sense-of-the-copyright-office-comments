Plagiarism is not allowed for a reason - why should we tolerate artistic plagiarism when it offers no merit. Art is a skilled and labored process, full of emotion and intent. Whether a sonnet, scripture, or canvas painting the creator must willingly give themselves to the creation itself. A machine cannot give itself when it has no higher thought processes. I&#39;d be willing to love and except AI generated pieces as art if the machine was able to communicate, able to tell us why it made the choices it did - but it can&#39;t. The AI is less Artificial Intelligence and more Procedural Blender as it takes what it has seen and tries to make something new when it does not understand what it sees. An algorithm has no intent besides what intent the manipulator of said machine wishes. Should we have had this AI arise in any other sector of life we never would have stood for it. Could a judge be replaced by a machine that doesn&#39;t even understand black or white? When fed legislation that it can&#39;t interpret beyond route yes or no? Would we tolerate a teacher that cannot think? Not to mention the many times that these AI machines can&#39;t be trusted to be good sources of information - a lawyer trusted his Chat GPT and had it give him cases that didn&#39;t exist he presented to the court only to have his ignorance at the failures of the machine revealed then? <br/><br/>Please, respect humanity. Respect creativity. Respect ingenuity. Don&#39;t respect those trying to remove humans from the humanities.
