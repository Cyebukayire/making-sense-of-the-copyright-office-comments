At the beginning if AI content generation, it was seen as a joke. Gradually, people realised how AI art worked and protested. The protests were ignored, however, until AI art became &#39;uncool&#39;. Now there are AI voice generators that are being used. AI voice technology is extremely damaging to both people who profit off of their voice (Voice Actors, Musicians, etc.) and people in public positions. If AI voice content becomes more normalised, companies will start leaning towards using AI voice technology over hiring voice actors. This event would cause many people to lose their jobs. AI voice has also been used to generate NSFW content of characters and people who are under the age of 18. The same issue has been prominent with AI art generation as well. <br/>AI voice has been compared to vocal synthesisers. There is one main difference that AI voice users disregard. The voicebanks and characters from vocal synthesisers are created with the voices of PAID individuals. Vocal synthesisers also do not sound identical to the voice provider, which creates a distinct barrier between the voice provider and the voicebank used in the synthesiser. The voice provider is compensated each time their voicebank is bought, sometimes as well as additional royalties. <br/>I firmly believe that AI content generation technology should not be used in most situations. There are instances where AI voice technology is used to replicate certain voices from deceased actors. I have no problem with that as long as the families of the actors are compensated for the use of the voice. <br/>In conclusion, AI generation technology should only be used if there are strict copyright laws and regulations keeping users in check. AI generation technology should if the original creators/actors are properly compensated.
