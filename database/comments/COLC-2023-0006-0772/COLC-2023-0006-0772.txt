Sites on which users share their creative works have been scraped for AI learning without the knowledge or consent of creators involved. Creators are having their content stolen against their will for the betterment of this tool, which is now also being used with threats of rendering human writers obsolete. This is immoral and unacceptable. There needs to be some sort of law or regulation put in place to protect creatives from having their work pried from their hands and churned into AI-generated content that they have no control over.
