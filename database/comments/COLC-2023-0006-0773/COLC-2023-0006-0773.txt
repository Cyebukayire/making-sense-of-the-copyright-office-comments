As a professional artist and former member of the film industry I am extremely concerned witht he rise of so called AI, allowing easy and rapid theft of people&#39;s voices, images, likenesses, intellectual property, and copyrighted material What is a trademark or copyright if this one form of stealing is exempt from laws we fought so hard for to own our own work? Who owns the rights to my art, my face, my voice? Do I not? If I don&#39;t then what country am I living in? Do we spit on the concept of human self-ownership and on every copyright law now in existence to say &quot;This, this theft is okay and your voice, your face, your likeness and your workc an be taken THIS way, because it blends it with other thefts?&quot;<br/> If you rob my house and put my stuff in among other stolen goods have you suddenly not robbed me? If you take my art and smear it together with someone else&#39;s, you have STILL robbed us both and cannot claim it as your work. <br/>The ownership of one&#39;s own creative property is the foundation of all art copyright. Is it not? What I make and who I am belong to me. Blending what it takes without consent into other proceeds of theft does not make the predictive pattern engine we call AI legal or moral. Stealing intellectual property should be an immutable foundation we can rely on for the right to own our faces, our voices, and our art. DO NOT, I urge you, legalize theft if it happens to involve a lot of it in one grab to make the result look &quot;original&quot;. If I steal everything you own, and combine it with everything all your neighbors own, the result is not new possessions. The result is you have all been robbed. Do not let &quot;AI&quot; rob artists and creators or you will have nothing. A society that stops valuing art becomes like North Korea- a place where only propaganda and profit exist and expression is no longer existent. A society without art is a society without hope. It will die.
