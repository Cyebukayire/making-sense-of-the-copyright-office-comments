Hello! My opinion on AI, the very thing that people keep clammoring, praising, and just whole heartedly beleive this tech is the future, will surprise you!<br/><br/>Simply put, it&#39;s not real.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a lie.  A lie that many tech guys and CEO&#39;s are telling many people who don&#39;t know enough and wouldn&#39;t dare challenge.  It a scam that tech bros rely on your ignarance to never question a the where and hows on the &#39;AI&#39; functions.  We do not live in a timeline where Detroit Becomes Human is real, it&#39;s a video game for a reason.<br/><br/>Ask yourself this, have you ever wondered what an &#39;AI&#39; looks like?  What is it&#39;s skeletal structre, blueprints, how does it &#39;draw&#39; or &#39;write&#39; ?  Was this AI taught this information?  How?  These questions are extremly imprtant for you and me, because if the tech people and CEOs con&#39;t show how an AI does, then that means they have been lying this entire time about what an AI is.  In reality the &#39;AI&#39; of today is just a man on the computer, from the otherside of the world, being paid less than the average person, to find preexisting information, art, music, and voices, and put them into a program that amalgmates everything into a massive mess of stolen ideas to be churn out to look like this amazing and beautiful collage!  Just like there&#39;s no such thing as self driving cars, that&#39;s not a real thing and I can&#39;t beleive we haven&#39;t taken them off the roads, do you have any idea how many people have gotten hurt?  How many more deaths till we dismantle them?<br/><br/>I am by no means an expert, but I am very confidant that this &#39;AI&#39; of today is not real.  By the time we, the world, comes close to a small understand on what an AI can do, each an every one of us will be 6 feet under.  If CEOs and techs can&#39;t prove with facts and evidence on how &#39;AI&#39; functions as a whole then they can and will be sued for lying!<br/><br/>I will re-iterate.  We humans of today do not have the means or the technology to produce or make &#39;AI&#39; We are seeing a massive take over of people stealing voices, music, art, and hundreds upon thousands of hours of work real humans have done so that companies and business do not have to pay a single dime to a real human being.  After alll, the lower the wages for entertainment, the bigger the profit!  We can&#39;t have that.<br/><br/>I hope this scares a some slimy CEO or business man who is considering to replace all of their employees with a computer, because they realize very quickly they have dropped millions of dollars on a computer that stole everything.<br/><br/>Please, I am begging anyone to please reconsider &#39;AI&#39; it&#39;s not something we can use, and won&#39;t be used in this time or the next.
