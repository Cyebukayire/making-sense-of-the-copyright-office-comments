I am an actor in Los Angeles and AI will rob me of my profession entirely and prevent me from making any sort of wages, let alone ability to pay and qualify for health insurance. AI should be banned in the arts and various other professions, if not all, for it displaces workers in every industry. AI will drive poverty up to levels never before seen, and it will cause a mass unemployment and depression in society for most people will no longer have a purpose in life. It is the largest existential threat of all human history.
