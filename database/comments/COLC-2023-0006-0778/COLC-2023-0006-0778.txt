I am a writer and, forgive my lack of humility, a darn good one. Creating stories for film and television brings me immense joy and knowing that my constantly evolving skills has the potential to bring joy to those who read or view my work elevates my joy exponentially. But the laughs or grimaces or tears that I am able to elicit with my words would be significantly less impactful if just one single ingredient was removed from the equation: humanity. Art is not just a means of express, it&#39;s a means of connection. It&#39;s the creator reaching out through their medium to the viewer and saying, &quot;Look! Me too!&quot; Or &quot;See? I understand.&quot; The value I bring to our culture is not the words I generate but the contribution to an ongoing, ebbing and flowing dialogue that we are having in this country. Artificial Intelligence can generate words and order them in a fashion that might be pleasing to consumers...but without humanity and experience and understanding behind those words...there can be no dialogue. No connection. No movement. At that point, the arts would serve as little more than fast food. Consumable yet impersonal. Caloric yet not nurturing. <br/><br/>I am grateful that this issue is being considered with such nuance. That this committee is looking to people for their thoughts and feelings on the subject speaks volumes towards the protection against AI. If this committee didn&#39;t value human experience, then I&#39;m sure some algorithm could be run that would lead to a defendable decision regarding copyright laws. Yet here we are. A palace where we could not arrive at by inputting mere data. So thank you for taking the time to consider.<br/><br/>I would also like to add that I believe people should be fairly compensated for the value they bring. By allowing AI to utilize the skills and effort and painstaking work of others in order to boil our value and experiences down to mere output feels unfair and, well, dehumanizing. Derivative art is sometimes unavoidable but allowing AI to use the work of others to be trained would lead to the normalization of the derivative. A new baseline that does nothing to challenge creativity or seek elevation in creators or consumers. It&#39;s a sad thought. It&#39;s a sad change that would launch our culture in a trite direction I fear we would never be able to take a step back from. It sets a dangerous precent that content and consumption is more important than intention and contemplation. I hope that this committee sees the same value in the work of countless artists than I do. And I hope you will fight not only for the protection of people who create this art...but for experience and benefit of those who participate and consume art as well. I hope you will fight to protect the intrinsic value that humanity brings. Thank you for your time. <br/><br/>P.s. <br/>At the bottom of this page, there was a Captcha prompt that I have to click in order to ensure that I am not a robot. Which, given the topic of this submission, could not be more amusing to me! So, as I will prove below by ticking a box, please allow me to say once again here that I am not a robot. I am a human being with passions and a perspective that I hope to be able to continue to share with my fellow human beings in a safe, protect fashion. Thanks again.
