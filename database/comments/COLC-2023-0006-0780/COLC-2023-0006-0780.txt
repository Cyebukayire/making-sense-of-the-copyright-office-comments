This technology absolutely needs more regulation. It&rsquo;s beyond unethical to train a machine on someone else&rsquo;s work and use it to output content that you then claim as your own. I think AI can be used for wonderful things. It should be. But absolutely not through theft and dishonesty. We need something to regulate it or it&rsquo;s going to hurt a lot of people.
