As a writer, both by trade and recreation, I fear that AI will rip off the work of content creators and creatives, inbibing such content without consent and copying their styles thus. What&#39;s worse is that the companies who have created this AI &quot;feed&quot; their AI bots with other artists&#39; work, thereby training them to copy &#39;in the style of&#39; etc. Creatives are not compensated and do not get to opt in or out of having their works used for AI training purposes (tech companies have, apparently, decided that virtually anything uploaded online is fair game), and the tech companies&#39; eventual goal is to render human creatives redundant by replacing them with AI that can work for &quot;cheaper&quot;. Without a system of UBI (universal basic income) in place, this will quite literally create starving artists.
