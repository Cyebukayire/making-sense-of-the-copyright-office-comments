Work generated by AI must not be copyrightable. A lot of arguments for this get caught up in traits such as creativity and originality, but those are distractions from the issue at hand. Copyright law must protect people, not machines. Most AIs are trained on copyrighted works, and so any work they produce will be plagiarism at best. However, even an AI trained entirely on public domain material should still not be copyrightable. It is work that is not made by a person, and should not be protected.
