Anything with writing, art, animation, voices, CGI, etc using AI generation should NOT be copyrighted.<br/><br/>AI scrapes and uses content made by artists, writers, animators, voice actors, etc., WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. The artists don&rsquo;t consent to it, writers don&rsquo;t consent to it- there&rsquo;s only been a few cases of people &ldquo;consenting&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s either done after the fact OR they are severely underpaid for their hard work.<br/><br/>Art is a form of expression, like movies and TV shows. It shouldn&rsquo;t be streamlined and it shouldn&rsquo;t be automated. And acts to try and do that should be discouraged- especially if it involves theft.<br/><br/>To quote various ads from my childhood- you wouldn&rsquo;t upload a car. Piracy is a crime.<br/><br/>And this is piracy, because they&rsquo;re stealing and taking what they want from the internet without paying for it or even asking for permission.<br/><br/>AI should not be allowed to be copyrighted. Not when it&rsquo;s literally theft, just to make a quick buck off of someone else&rsquo;s hard work. We artists put HOURS into creating masterpieces, and they stole all of it so that they can just &ldquo;type in a prompt&rdquo; and get it done. It&rsquo;s not even done well, because they don&rsquo;t put their soul into it.<br/><br/>We do.<br/><br/>Do not copyright theft.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s unfair to millions.
