I am deeply concerned about the use of AI resulting in artists not being compensated for their work, and their work being scraped from places they must share it publicly to survive on the internet for uses against their wishes. While I think AI can be helpful in some contexts and the programs themselves may be useful, the way they train their models without compensating the source material creators AND without asking for permission from those people is unacceptable. This will result in people creating less things out of fear they will simply be stolen - whether by a large company like Google that decides to use people&rsquo;s emails and documents for input material, or a smaller company scraping creations from social media. Many people do not have a choice due to class and income level to afford private document or creative software, and need to post their work in public spaces like social media to secure awareness and income. Just because people have to use these public places doesn&rsquo;t mean people that make AI programs have the right to essentially duplicate it and not credit or compensate their source material. This is dangerous for personal privacy and safety as much as it is economic for people creating things that are accessible to the public. For example, if someone shares a video of them talking for 30 seconds, a scammer can use this to make an AI copy of their voice to impersonate them and steal their identity, money, investments, or other things. Whether malicious or not, AI poses enormous threats to people that want to create and sell things to make a living, and live safely in a modern internet driven economy. We need to protect creators and put the burden of privacy, securing rights, and compensating use of created things on the new technologies and the companies putting them forward, NOT individual creators and inventors that cannot protect themselves on an individual level.
