AI should not be used for corporate means. It should be used as a tool to help manage work flow for writers, artists, and disabled people. As it stands right now it is not being used for that as grifters are currently using it to make a quick buck and it has the potential to drive millions out of work, considering what we&#39;re seeing with the Writers&#39; and Actors&#39; strikes going on right now. As one of the objectives they are striking on is the possibility being replaced by AI, their image being owned by a corporation and being driven out of a job.
