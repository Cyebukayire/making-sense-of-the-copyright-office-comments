All major current generative A.I. models are built off of millions of stolen works scraped from the internet with no care for permission from the original authors. if these companies want to sell programs using copy written work then they should be beholden to compensate anyone whose work they use. of course this is a fairly impractical idea, as they steal so recklessly that I imagine none of them could provide a list of all the works used so they should be forced to delete all the training data from their current models and rebuild them exclusively with works they have licensed or those from the public domain.
