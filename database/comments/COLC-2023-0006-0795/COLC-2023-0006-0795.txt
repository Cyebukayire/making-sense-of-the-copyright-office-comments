AI is dangerous and the implications of a new wild-west frontier on the internet/digital platforms with unregulated or supervised AI is untenable. AI, at this point in time with the platforms its on right now, is nothing more than theft to me. I am not interested in stripping creators and artists of their rights to their work and feeding it into a program without their consent, compensation, or any regard for courtesy. Please put a stop to the thieving business people making and running these platforms, and put stops in place to protect artists and make it clear that AI cannot and should not be copyrighted. Protect artists!
