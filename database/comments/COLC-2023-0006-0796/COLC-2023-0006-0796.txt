The regulation of AI is an existential moment for the future of humanity. I am a writer by trade and every original thing I have produced has been scrubbed by AI software that has consumed it and will attempt to use it without my knowledge or approval. This is an inexcusable exploitation of my original ideas and directly affects my livelihood and my future in my chosen career. More importantly, very powerful tech companies backed by private equity are leading the charge here. It is a money and power grab. Make no mistake. And the more that they are left unchecked, the more we are all at risk. Please do not underestimate the control that we give them if we just sit by and let it happen. We need congressional oversight, a federal commission, and the copywrite office needs a department of legal ethical AI experts to steer this new technology into the future. Left unchecked, AI could have a devastating effect on us globally and as a human race. I implore you to investigate, set up guard rails, and pump the breaks on AI and those who wish to push its agenda on the public with impunity. Our future depends on it.
