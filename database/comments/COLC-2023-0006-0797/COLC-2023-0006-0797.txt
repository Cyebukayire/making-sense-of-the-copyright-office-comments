I am a young artist aspiring to be a graphic designer. This comment will be about AI art specifically, but the idea holds value for all forms of generative art.<br/><br/>As an artist, I am aware of the immense amount of work that it takes to create good pieces of art and I hold an extreme amount of respect to those who do art professionally. I believe new tools should help artists, and make their jobs easier while allowing them to stay in their field. I believe generative AI has the power to help artists create and build on concepts, and help create reference imagery. I vehemently believe it should NOT be claimed by anyone. The person who wrote the prompt did not create the image. The person who programmed the AI did not create the image. The AI itself, along with the countless cross-referenced images made by artists everywhere, made the image, and thus I believe it should be under the Fair Use license. I&#39;m not against the use of AI in art, I am against AI replacing artists.
