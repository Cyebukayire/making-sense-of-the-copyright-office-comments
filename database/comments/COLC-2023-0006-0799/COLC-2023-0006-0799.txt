Creative writing websites, such as Archive Of Our Own have been scraped by AI writing programs to fuel their algorithm. This is extremely disheartening to me as an independent author who loves to share my creative works with my friends and fellow fans on the internet. I share these works for free, but they are extremely important to me personally, and to see them infringed upon for a quick buck is heartbreaking. I believe AI&#39;s should only source works, for their algorithm, with a website and/or author&#39;s approval. It&#39;s wrong for AI programs, both legally and from a moral standpoint, to claim authorship of another person&#39;s writing as their own, just because they can find it on the internet. It&#39;s plagiarism, plain and simple.
