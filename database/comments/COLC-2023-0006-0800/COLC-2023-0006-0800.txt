Artificial Intelligence is intentionally being used to circumvent people&#39;s intellectual property.  It is impossible for AI to create work that is not based on someone else&#39;s labor and production.  It is therefore impossible for AI to be used in a way that does not infringe copyright or consent for use.  AI must be regulated now before intellectual property becomes a free-for-all among corporations that have profit interests set above the interests of the workers and artists whose work fuels the AI&#39;s existence.<br/><br/>Regulate AI.  No AI can be used commercially without consent, and no contract should force a worker to have their voice, art, persona, or work to be replicated when they have no ability to consent to such.  Law should include the deceased, as there have already been efforts to replicate deceased actors with CGI and AI, who have no ability to consent to such and whose legacies are tarnished for marketing purposes.  Non-commercial AI should be regulated as well to ensure that prior consent is given to any work being used in such algorithms.
