The thing about AI is that the databanks it uses to create its works are comprised mostly of works created by actual humans that were taken without their consent, and this applies to both art and writing AIs. Therefore, I believe we should place harsh restrictions and punishments on the use of AI to create works of fiction so as to protect the livelihoods of countless creatives across the country.
