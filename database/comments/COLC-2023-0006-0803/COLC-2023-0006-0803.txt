AI is copyright infringement on a scale we&#39;ve barely seen before, with most AI trained on vast pools of stolen work. It is not the same as someone reading a novel and writing their own using a similar concept: a human will always have their own words to bring to a story, while an AI has nothing but the words from the story it&#39;s been fed. In addition, AI has been used to impersonate people, stealing their appearance and voice. The right to one&#39;s own image and the sound of one&#39;s own voice is one of the most basic rights anyone has; image and voice are cornerstones of actors&#39; and models&#39; livelihoods, and AI is being used to infringe on them.
