I agree art was created by humans for humans, AI. Should leave art alone and go on and improve other fields like improve farming,take care of tasks that&#39;s normally too dangerous for humans to complete, cure diseases..etc it has huge pros and cons of possibilities why art of all things?<br/>AI is not only trained in a lot of stolen work and copyrighted content but it also creates stuff that for the most part one does not have complete control over, it&#39;s more along the lines of comissioning than anything else, even if one makes changes to it, the assets for it exist already for the most part and prompts cannot count as an artistic creation because they are still done by a machine for the most part, it&#39;s like embalming decals on it. Can you be called an artist or own something because you placed a decal on something you didn&#39;t do?<br/><br/>
