The biggest issue with AI-art besides the major issue of a complete lack of accreditation, is the push to Replace human creatives with AI. People will go out, and train their models on artists&#39; work without consulting the artists, and claim that what the model spits out is their own. I believe this could be solved by requiring ALL AI-generated art to be posted with a publicly viewable list of training sources, and if any of the artists on said training list object to their art being used to train the AI then the art can not be posted or sold. Companies like Netflix, will lay-off dozens of human artists, and without providing credit train an AI on their art and replace them with it, and in their minds they owe the artist nothing at best, and at worst they claim copyright ownership of the art style and the artist can&#39;t make money off their own style anymore. You have companies like Zoom, taking advantage of their near-ubiquitous presence to disallow users from being part of AI training models, and you know as well as I that they have never had a thought of compensating a single user for their likeness or contributions towards AI training that Zoom intends to profit immensely off of. <br/>This technology has been around for less than 5 years, in any meaningful capacity. Already, individuals and corporations are abusing this technology to their fullest extent, and with the scale of our world&#39;s economy that means millions of people are or will be hurt by the problems I have mentioned above.
