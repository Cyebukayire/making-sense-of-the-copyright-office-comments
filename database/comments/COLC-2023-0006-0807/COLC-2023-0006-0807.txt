While I think there could be benefits to using AI, it has been an absolute terror on intellectual property, especially in the arts. I have seen AI engines steal from artists and writers alike, without retribution, only to turn around and sell the resulting product without any financial gain for the communities they steal from. The people behind this technology will only continue to take without consequence because they are not creators themselves, and don&rsquo;t seem to have the emotional and moral intelligence needed to understand why stealing from others is bad. I would like to see some laws in place protecting intellectual property and copyrights from being infringed upon by AI. This needs to be enacted quickly before smaller creative businesses are further harmed.
