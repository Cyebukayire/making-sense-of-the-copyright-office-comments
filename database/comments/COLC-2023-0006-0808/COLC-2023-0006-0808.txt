I am not an artist as a career but rather for fun. I sometimes share my art online, including writing and drawing. One of my greatest fears is that my art will be scraped by AI. I barely get attention on my art, very few people comment or compliment it. And yet, AI could easily take advantage of my work. My art is me sharing skills I worked years to learn. I&#39;m honestly considering not posting my art anymore because I don&#39;t want anyone using my hard work to train a machine.<br/><br/>If I feel this concerned about AI as someone who creates art for fun, how must artists who depend on their content for their livelihood feel?<br/><br/>
