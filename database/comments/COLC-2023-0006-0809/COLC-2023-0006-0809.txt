AI-generated works should not be copyrighted. Period. <br/><br/>Every AI-generated work has scraped data from copyrighted works - without the author/Artist&rsquo;s/actor&rsquo;s/human&rsquo;s permission - and regurgitated that copyrighted material into a jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>The puzzle is not a brand new work. The puzzles is thousands of individually copyrighted bits and pieces, stolen from their human creators, assembled into a jigsaw puzzle. This is not transformative. There is theft. <br/><br/>We CANNOT allow the copyrighting of AI generated material. This affects me as a writer. It affects actors. It affects artists. Mega corporations, including Hollywood studios, want to do away with human ingenuity, creativity, and most of all human PAYCHECKS, by peddling stolen material with AI generated material. <br/><br/>If twelve cars are stolen, disassembled, and reassembled into twelve different cars, all made with the stolen mismatched parts - are those &ldquo;new&rdquo; cars not also, by definition, stolen? When every piece is stolen, nothing is legal.<br/><br/>Not to mention, in the AI generation process, there is no human creativity transforming the works (which aren&rsquo;t even transformed but jigsawed together, stolen bit by bit.) Entering a prompt is no more CREATION than having an idea in your head that never leaves your head.  <br/><br/>HUMANS create. MACHINES regurgitate. I cannot stress strongly enough how devastating for the entire human race it will be to allow copyrighting of AI generated material. <br/><br/>I strongly urge you to ban all AI-generated works from being copyrighted. I also urge you to pursue criminal charges against the AI tech that has scraped and stolen copyrighted work. This nightmare needs to end.
