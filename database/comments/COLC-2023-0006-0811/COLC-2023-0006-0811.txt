I am strongly against generative AI like ChatGPT. It disrespects the artistic process and cheapens the valuable labor of artists while providing and inferior product. As a schoolteacher, I have had to deal with many students trying to pass off unoriginal AI-generated work and, while I do my best to catch them, I know that there are countless students getting away with it, and in the process harming themselves by not learning key skills of critical thinking and clear communication. It&#39;s also important that the content AI generates simply isn&#39;t very good. The writing is clean but never interesting and provides incorrect information (some of it dangerous) very often. I fail to see who could possibly benefit besides companies looking to lay off workers, and I don&#39;t think anyone wants that (besides the companies themselves, of course). I don&#39;t have experience in copyright law, but I know that the personal rights of creators are being harmed by having AI scrape their data with no compensation or acknowledgement. I also know that, being an entirely new scenario, the precedents set now will have long-lasting effects. So please, please, please do whatever you can to stop, or at least slow, this tumor on the creative world.
