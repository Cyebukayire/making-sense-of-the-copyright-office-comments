I am opposed to the allowance of AI-created work to be copyrighted, as existing generative AI platforms have shown they are categorically unable to to resist using copyrighted content. My own art from deviantart was used to train an AI platform without my consent and I received no compensation and was not given the opportunity to remove my work from the system. I have since deleted my deviantart account and will only be posting further work on platforms that guarantee protections against AI use. I strongly urge the copyright office to impose a robust system to control AI training and require solid documentation of what materials are used to train any given AI, to prove without a doubt that no copyrighted work was used in its training.
