Hello, I am Rebecca Roney. I believe artists should have more control over their art and the copyright claims to them. Human artists don&rsquo;t just copy and paste what they find online or what they like about others work. That is all AI is possible of doing. People who actually make art put thought, emotion, education, and more into their work. There is a reason that you can get a degree in art, art history, a specific medium so on and so forth.   While I can not include exactly what makes each persons art uniquely theirs and why AI fails to even be on the same level as humans; if you took any college level class on art, composition, or the history of art you would see that people don&rsquo;t just paint whatever they think is pretty. People have to stand back from their work look at what is missing and fill that gap with their own minds. Does the colors of the piece complement each other? Is it balanced? Do you convey the message you wanted to through this piece? Does the audience feel emotion when looking at your work? Is this the right medium for this piece? These are some baseline questions Artists go through when making a piece. A AI machine can&rsquo;t possibly make something uniquely theirs. It is only possible of copying others work. Many people online have even pointed out how some AI images are so reliant on someone else work that you can name the artist they copied and stole from. Without real human artists there will be no art. Have respect for them and their work by protecting it!
