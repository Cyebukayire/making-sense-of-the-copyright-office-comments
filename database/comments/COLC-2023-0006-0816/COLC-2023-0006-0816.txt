LLM&#39;s and Machine Learning are powerful tools being placed in the hands of sociopaths who built them with stolen work.  STOLEN.  The crap arguments that they make about &#39;fair use&#39; and &#39;that&#39;s how people learn&#39;...yes, people learn from books, but they STOLE the books.  EVERYTHING that these things are doing is stolen, stolen, stolen.  Until they make an LLM trained on ENTIRELY consent based material, these abominations need to be sent back to the basement.
