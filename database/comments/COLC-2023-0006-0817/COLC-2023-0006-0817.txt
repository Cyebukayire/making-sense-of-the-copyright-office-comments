I really think it&#39;s ridiculous for AI to exploit writers, artists, and creators and to profit off of their work. It&#39;s frustrating as a consumer that even book companies are starting to use AI for book covers. I shouldn&#39;t have to wonder if art is ethically used and authentically made by a person. It&#39;s important to the spirit of art and art consumption that it captures a unique human creator&#39;s vision, since I am a unique human consumer. It also stands to reason they would have sole propriety over their talent and creativity. Are AI companies going to compensate creators for their time, schooling, etc.? It&#39;s a farce - pure capitalism at its worst, violating the whole intention of copyright law in the first place. Please protect people&#39;s rights to their work, period.
