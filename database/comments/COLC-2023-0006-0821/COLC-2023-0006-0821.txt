If I took a Disney film poster into Photoshop, outlined the the main shapes then painted over the lines as my sketch, I would be violating Disney&#39;s copyright. There is no reason explanation AI generated content should be exempt from this standard. One should not be able to copyright work created from other copywritted work, that has not entered the public domain. Current AI training models scrap information from the entire world wide web, including content we could normally consider private (See Google ToS for Google Drive/Docs). As there is no reliable method for verifying the AI did not utilize copyright protected works to generate the content, no AI generated works should be eligible for copyright protection. The current rules in places are too relaxed. My copyright protected photos should not be allowed to be used in an AI training database without my license for use or selling of rights. AI generated works are by nature not original works and should never be eligible for copyright protection.
