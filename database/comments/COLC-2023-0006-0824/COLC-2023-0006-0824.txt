Any and all works created by way of technologies commonly referred to as &#39;AI&#39; should not be copyrightable. Copyright exists for the explicit purpose of protecting those who create and control original materials, whether it be books, music, movies and other arts, or technology, manufacturing, brands, or other things, and AI technology is not a person or animal. Nothing created by AI is created with any kind of intelligence, heart, perspective or experience behind it. The results of AI generated materials are derived entirely from human works and nature that came before it. <br/><br/>If AI was allowed to be copyrightable and therefore profitable, there&#39;s absolutely no doubt, whatsoever, that it would be wildly taken advantage of to the point that not only would it put millions of artists, creators, writers, inventors, programmers and more be put out of work, but also lead to mass cultural stagnation, which in turn rots the hearts and minds of the masses, and makes for a poorer, unenriched life. <br/><br/>I cannot stress enough how strongly I feel about making sure that AI productions cannot be copyrighted. To allow it to be copyrighted would have devastating affects on the future of humanity. At an absolute bare minimum, things made by way of AI should be legally required to prominently display that information alongside what percentage of the product was made using AI, as awareness of that might affect whether or not a person wishes to purchase those materials.
