We have security measures in place in every aspect of life, whether it&rsquo;s on the web, using smoke detectors, body scans at the airport, including below where we are asked to confirm &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a robot.&rdquo;  Why bother putting these systems in place if we are going to allow AI generated work to pose as human creativity.  The term copyright was invented to protect intellectual property. Keep it that way.  Anything generated by AI whether instructed by human or otherwise should be stated as such.  We need to distinguish between our own individual creativity and intellect, and that of AI-generated.
