Hi! Thank you for opening to comments. I think now is a crucial time for protecting the rights of artists, writers, and other creators against AI theft. I hope that the copyright office and the government can step up to do what it takes to protect creative and intellectual property rights, especially given the way that AI is being used currently -- with art being stolen to train stable diffusion models, writing being stolen for chat GPT, and even misleading content being created that can have possibly fatal results. For example, the mushroom foraging books sold on Amazon created by AI that do not contain accurate information could very well end in someone&#39;s death. This is a matter of not only ethics, but also the safety of US citizens. Please create the necessary regulations to protect people&#39;s rights and safety, combat misinformation, and ensure that AI is used responsibly. Thank you!
