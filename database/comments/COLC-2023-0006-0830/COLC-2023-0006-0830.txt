AI is a useful tool that could be utilized in many beneficial ways, however the current trend of AI simply being used to replace human labor in all walks of life is not one of them. AI being so readily and widely available while there are next to no regulations or limitations in place is extremely detrimental to both the people whose careers this affects and the development of AI itself. There need to be immediate laws put into effect that regulate the use, privacy, ownership, and ethics of AI, and they need to be retroactive. All companies utilizing AI should abide by the same regulations, and make very clear exactly what people are signing up for when they use a service that involves AI in any way. If steps are not taken as soon as possible to control AI&#39;s rapid development, it will soon completely override human labor as a subpar replacement, increasing levels of people who will be jobless, unhoused, depressed, or otherwise unable to help themselves or their families. The outcry from countless communities, protests, strikes, and such are not happening for no reason- people around the world are desperately trying to bring attention to the actual impacts of AI technology that has been overshadowed by the &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;tech advancement&quot; side. Please listen to the voices of these human beings. AI needs to be regulated or its use needs to be stopped entirely until fair and ethical agreements can be made.
