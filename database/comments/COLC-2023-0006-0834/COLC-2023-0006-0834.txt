Any AI-generated material from an AI trained on any amount of already copyrighted material or fair use material cannot be copyrighted, unless the copyrighted material is owned by the creator of the AI. Additionally, if there is no human involved, AI creations should not be able to be copyrighted as no human brain was involved in the creation and everything from it was just spit out by a computer and an algorithm. If a company is found to be using an AI that has been trained with copyrighted material from another company, the company using the other company&#39;s already copyrighted material should be able to be sued.
