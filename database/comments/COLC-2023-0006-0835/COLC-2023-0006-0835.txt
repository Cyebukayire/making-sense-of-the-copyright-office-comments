As an actual artist it is sad to see the creative field becoming a mess and maybe even dying at a professional level. Ai training should not include copyrighted material at all. Those greedy companies should rebuild their datasets based on copyright free material only and their data crawlers shouldn&rsquo;t take any data they find freely. I don&rsquo;t want that my artwork, photos, voice, face or texts will be just raw data without consent or compensation. No matter where I publish, this should be the default. Ai generated content should never be grantes copyright and should include a watermark or some other way to show people it is not made by a human. Transparency is also an issue and the companies should tell us where the data is coming from and how to remove data and such. They should also compensate to those whose data has been used.
