Essentially what AI is doing is plagiarizing. When something is written based on information accumulated from various sources, those sources must be properly cited, or else the content produced is a copy. Chatbots such as ChatGPT are, at their base level, scraping data from a variety of sources, then compiling them and spitting them back out for the user, without giving credit for the ideas, writings, and creations to the people who uploaded them to the internet in the first place.<br/><br/>Now, it is not illegal to lie online. However, it *is* illegal to steal information, writing, or ideas and use them for profit. The people who program and run these AIs are certainly making a profit from this Charybdis-like vat of information, but beyond that, people are using these tools, tools that are using data pulled from online sources, and using the results to make money. Whether it&rsquo;s art, writing, or code, these &ldquo;tools&rdquo; are taking the work of *actual people,* mixing them up a bit, and spitting them back out in a slightly different form, allowing human users to then use those results for their own financial gain.
