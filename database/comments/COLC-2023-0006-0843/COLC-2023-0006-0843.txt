The danger of rampant, unchecked artificial intelligence far out weighs possible incremental benefits. <br/>Improving basic computations to make marginal gains in efficiency does not offset the loss of security, and the decay of the whole of the arts and &quot;humanities&quot;. Why will people paint or write when a computer can instantly copy their or the styles of masters in the past, and generate thousands of identical works? Who is going to become a writer when an AI can steal their writing styles and anyone can have &quot;you&quot; write whatever book they want for free? <br/><br/>Humans will be relying on AI for things that were once basic human interactions, we&#39;ll lose touch with not just what defines our existence and our impact on the world, but our sense of value, purpose, uniqueness, etc.
