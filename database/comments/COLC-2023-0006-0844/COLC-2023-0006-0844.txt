AI work should not be allowed to be considered for copyright, end of discussion. For AI generated materials to exist, they need datasets full of non consensually collected (stolen) works; including but not limited to: Artwork, Videos, Audio, Photography, Written Works, and sometimes even combinations of multiple mediums.
