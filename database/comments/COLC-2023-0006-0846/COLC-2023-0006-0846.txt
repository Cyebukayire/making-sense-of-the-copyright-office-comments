Allowing AI &quot;creators&quot; to register copyright to their generative AI &quot;works&quot; poses an existential threat to human creators. In addition to the copyright issues posed by the datasets, there is the distinct possibility an AI could be set to a mode akin to &quot;a million monkeys and a million typewriters,&quot; which could generate- and copyright- huge chunks of random text. This text could then be used with a comparison system to scan the works of new writers and set them up for malicious lawsuits by the AI &quot;creators&quot; whose AIs first generated a given sentence, paragraph, or turn of phrase.<br/><br/>Document comparison systems already exist, and have been used widely by colleges and universities for close to twenty years. When I was an undergrad, a classmate&#39;s paper was actually flagged by one of these systems for having allegedly plagiarized an obscure source that we had no access to. Thankfully, the professor was the department head and overruled the system, but it illustrates how these systems are already proven to work with unimaginably vast datasets.<br/><br/>The end result of allowing AI &quot;work&quot; to be copyrighted would end up something like the modern culture of &quot;patent trolling&quot;- when a corporation buys patents with no intention of actually making or selling a product, and sues people who try to market similar inventions. There would be nothing to stop a copyright troll from using a generative AI for the exact same extortive purpose. It would have a chilling effect on the arts and humanities, and possibly the social science as well.<br/><br/>Imagine, if you will, a world where every sentence, paragraph, and turn of phrase has to be carefully searched to determine the rights holder, and then having to license each use for whatever exorbitant fees the rights holder deems appropriate. Such a world is not one where the arts and humanities can flourish, and even freedom of the press is stifled by the abuse of systems the Founding Fathers would have rather used to protect and nourish them. And, as the culture of patent trolling has proven, it isn&#39;t merely the domain of science fiction.<br/><br/>Do what Jefferson would&#39;ve wanted. Deny copyright to AI &quot;content.&quot;
