AI art I have seen online has overwhelmingly stolen from real, human artists/creators without giving credit or compensation of any kind. This is harmful to creators because their creations are reduced to mere data points and the creators receive nothing in return. AI programs require loads of data created by people in order to function and improve. The people whose data is used by AI must be compensated when AI engines make use of their art and other data. Compensation to creators/artists provides recognition of their work and shows that what they make and do is valued. Furthermore, creators should have the right to decide when they do not want AI to be able to use something they made. The consent of the human creator is vital.
