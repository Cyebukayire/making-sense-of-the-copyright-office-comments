Hello, I&#39;m a hobbyist artist, as well as an office worker in administration in higher education and academia. I am concerned with unregulated AI because it threatens the very livelihood of my peers and how it tramples on existing copyright laws. When it comes to AI, it feels like it is a buzzword in a field that just brags and lauds itself as pioneers of disruptive innovation. And with disruptive innovation, time has shown that, while new and emerging technology can be disruptive, it has not always innovated things always for the better. These technology, and AI in particular, tend to be disruptive solely because it is trying to dodge existing regulations to benefit those who have no relevant stakes in said field for the sake of making a quick turn of profit. If you remember the recent trend with NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) and how everyone was heavily pushing unregulated cryptocurrency, it ended up scamming others of their money, encouraged others to steal creative and intellectual property off of others, and profit off of other people&#39;s work, only to crash a few months later. I believe that strong regulation of AI technology, especially given how strict industries take plagiarism, copyright, and intellectual property, will be especially beneficial in making sure such technology is used responsibility and to prevent the livelihoods of others from being threatened. I genuinely believe that, if other artists and academics can adhere to copyrights and regulations to create and innovate all these years without major issues, I believe those who use AI for the same purpose can, too.
