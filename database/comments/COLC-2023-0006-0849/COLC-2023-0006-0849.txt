I am a writer/journalist covering media as my beat. When ChatGPT first showed up, I was given press access to it. Because I&#39;m the type of guy who sometimes Google searches his own name, I asked the AI if it knew who I was. It correctly identified me. When I asked it to write articles in my style, it first offered up a generic article that was nothing like my writing. So, I asked it if that was really &quot;in the style of Joshua M. Patton,&quot; it acknowledged it wasn&#39;t and then wrote something that directly lifted whole phrases from my past work. It did the same thing with my Twitter account when I asked it to write tweets like mine. I unfortunately did not screenshot or save the chats.
