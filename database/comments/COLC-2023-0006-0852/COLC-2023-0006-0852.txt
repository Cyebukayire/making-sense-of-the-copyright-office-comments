The U.S. Copyright Office is considering whether or not to permit copyrighting of fiction and art created by so-called AI.<br/><br/>All AI content is based on theft of intellectual property from humans. So-called AI requires training sets, and these companies are finding content on the internet that both is copyrighted and easy to access for free.  Those writers and artists are having their copyrights violated, without compensation, without credit.  Do I have proof of a particular case in which this happened?  No.  But enough content has been incorporated into AI databases that it does a fairly good job of mimicking that content.  Science fiction author John Scalzi wrote on his blog about asking one of these AI fiction-generating sites to generate a story in the &ldquo;style of John Scalzi&rdquo;. He reported that the result was similar to something he might have written early in his career, on an off-day.  It was recognizably his style, although not well written.<br/><br/>As an amateur fiction writer, I object to having my fiction, copyrighted or not, paid or not, being incorporated into AI databases.  I have indirect evidence that this has already happened to me.  Nothing concrete enough that I can use to sue an AI company, if I had any idea of which company &ldquo;scraped&rdquo; my fiction.  But strong enough evidence that I feel angry and violated.  There is nothing I can do to prevent this, if my work is posted on the internet for others to enjoy.<br/><br/>The Writer&rsquo;s Guild of America is currently on strike against four studios over several different issues, one of which is whether their work can be altered by AI-written material or whether it can be incorporated into AI training sets.  This is both an economic issue for them and an issue of respect for their human creativity.  WGA demands that safeguards against both these things be incorporated into their contracts.  The studios have made a counter-offer of annual discussions of these topics, with no promise of a resolution.<br/><br/>People who write or create art are rightfully concerned that their creative work will be replaced by less expensive AI-generated fiction and art.  They are concerned that they will be out of work.  Some amount of this unemployment is probably inevitable; AI is already too pervasive.  The very editor I am using to write this comment is AI-based; it provides guesses at the next word I will type based on databases of how people write.  Its guesses are good.  But the damage to the employment of creative writers and artists will be mitigated if AI-generated content that resembles paid creative efforts by humans cannot be copyrighted.  Publishing companies should not sell books written by AI.  Movie companies should not rent or sell movies whose screenplays were written by AI.
