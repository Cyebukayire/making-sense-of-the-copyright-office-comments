These programs actively scrap art from individuals without any prior permission. Many individuals who may use these programs actively sell the generated content without any consent from the artist. A human standpoint cannot and should not be argued for AI as it is not a human but a tool for stealing artwork of a thousand artists. The only individuals who want to use AI generated content are individuals who have complete disregard for Copyright laws and want any and all regulations to not apply to them.
