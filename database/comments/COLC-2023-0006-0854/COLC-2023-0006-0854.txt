On the subject of AI using copyrighted material, as an artist, I find it unfair to have my skills used without my permission to train something that wants to replace me is incredibly unjust. AI should only be allowed to be trained by copyrighted material if they have explicit permission from the original person Directly (Not through a website who adds it to their terms of service) or if the copyrighted person is being paid for their products use. <br/><br/>I also think AI&rsquo;s &lsquo;product&rsquo; can&rsquo;t be copyrighted, I&rsquo;ve heard a great parallel to AI generated things is like baking a cake: You go to the AI, and &lsquo;order&rsquo; a product, and then go to claim you &lsquo;baked&rsquo; it. And unless it&rsquo;s trained on Non-copyrighted things, or given permission explicitly it wasn&rsquo;t even open source/allowed anyway, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be ok to claim it as your own.<br/><br/>And even without a human involved, someone had to program the script to ask the AI to do something. I can see very easily how people might use this like a loophole. Programming scripts to ask AI to generate certain things to pass off as their own or use for monetary gain. <br/><br/>As for how Copyright liability should work, I think it should slot into the rules we have now. I think it&rsquo;s going to need to be strictly regulated and enforced to get it under control. I see all the time artists upset that an AI has been trained on their art to make art like them without their permission. Which is incredibly unjust. In the long run it can put the artist out of work.<br/><br/>Please take this issue seriously and strictly; A lot of artists are at stake, as well as other professions. I always thought as a kid that someday bots would take over the hard work jobs so that people could just do what they were passionate about, and the boys would make food and money not a problem. I didn&rsquo;t realize they would come for the arts and other passion jobs first.
