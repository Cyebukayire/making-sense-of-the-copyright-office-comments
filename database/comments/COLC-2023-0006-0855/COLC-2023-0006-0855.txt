I am an illustrator whose livelihood would be greatly impacted by the rampant unchecked use of AI. It has been made abundantly clear to me that AI that is trained on copyrighted materials cannot create a unique output that is not in some way made up of the original pieces, thus blatantly infringing on the original authors&#39; copyright, and if it is not regulated it will be massively detrimental to creatives of all kinds who want to make a fair living from their own work. Allowing the users of AI to profit off of other people&#39;s hard work will have catastrophic impacts on industries that employ millions of people as job creators seek to cut their own costs and rely on cheap AI &quot;art&quot; rather than providing jobs to skilled workers. Art of all kinds (writing, visual art, audio) that is used to train AI should legally be required to be strictly opt-in to protect the work of millions of creatives that in turn creates countless job opportunities for people across the economic spectrum.<br/><br/>Besides the loss of untold billions of dollars flowing through the economy if these jobs were lost, AI trained to mimic specific artists&#39; styles or the voices and appearances of people like actors and politicians has truly horrifying consequences, ethical and financial among other things, in a world where fake news runs rampant and is a daily threat to the safety of millions of US citizens and people across the globe. AI could bring about catastrophic danger to everyday people like creating false confessions or statements; imagine someone convicted of a crime they didn&#39;t commit because of AI &quot;evidence,&quot; or imagine someone murdered in a fit of jealousy because of a fictional AI image generation making the person&#39;s partner believe they were cheated on, or someone framed as a terrorist because of an AI-generated voice issuing a threat in their voice.<br/><br/>AI is an incredibly dangerous tool and cannot be allowed to exist unmoderated. It is a danger to countless American jobs, our status as a cultural leader in the arts field, and the lives of everyday citizens. It must be carefully and strongly regulated in the best interest of people worldwide.
