As an artist, my greatest fear is having someone steal art that I poured innumerable hours into, and sell it to people who don&#39;t care that it&#39;s stolen. Unfortunately, this is a reality for artists whose work was used to train an AI: their work was stolen, uploaded to a database without permission, and is being used to generate computer images that resemble that artist&#39;s work. People who don&#39;t care about stolen artwork then use those images for free, and the artist who supplied the style that trained the AI is left without compensation or legal recourse. The same is now happening to voice actors, whose livelihood depends on acting as specific characters, and whose voices are now being stolen by individuals that care more about internet jokes than the actor&#39;s job. Frankly, we cannot rely on people feeling a sense of honesty and fair use when it comes to AI content, because they have already proven they don&#39;t care about morality or livelihoods. Faulty logic and entitlement has created an art world full of phonies pretending they &quot;made&quot; an AI-generated image and genuine artists failing to get the recognition and pay they deserve. The ONLY solution, in my opinion, is regulation of AI and laws protecting the copyright and use of artists&#39; work. AI owes its existence to people who deserve much greater recognition and respect than this.
