As a citizen of not just the USA, but earth, I do not belive that anything an AI makes shoule be allowed to hold any kind of copyright. I do understand that copyright law is difficult and ever changing. *coughdisneycough* <br/>But letting a computer program spit out a(for example): piece of art, story, script, image, video, soundbite, music, etc WILL DEGRADE THE QUALITY OF EVERYTHING GOING FORWARD!  The programs DO NOT think for themselvs, they absorb, chew for a moment and spit out something mildly similar. THIS IS NOT TRUE CREATION. So many artists are already having issues of revenue by others training ai on their art, loosing them commisions. Which is only the start if we allow these peices of code the ability to have any sort of copyright on their &#39;creation&#39;. And WHO would be the holder of the copyright? The person who owns the program? The person who prompted it? <br/>If we arent ready to give it personhood, and all that applies, we shouldnt grant it copyright. <br/>Thank you for reading my opinions,  and I wish you the best day and a peice of your favorite candy.
