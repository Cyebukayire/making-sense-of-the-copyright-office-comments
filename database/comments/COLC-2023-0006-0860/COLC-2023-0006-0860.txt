The fact that so-called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (really large language learning models/large visual learning models) is not considered a copyright violation is absurd. Parody, satire, etc. of another person&#39;s work - taking elements of another person&#39;s work - should only be considered copyright-able when that derivative work is created using human creativity and intelligence. Just as we can&#39;t copyright the paintings of elephants or dogs, or the patterns that leaves make on our grass, neither should we be able to copyright the output of LLMs. Furthermore, the datasets utilized by these programs constitute blatant infringement. The sizes of the scraped datasets are derived and remixed by machine algorithm from copyrighted works - every piece of output generated by an LLM is ultimately a derivation of another person&#39;s intellectual property. It becomes even worse when the LLMs claim to generate &quot;in the style of ...&quot; a certain author or artist, thereby violating fair use by drawing potential profit away from the original author/artist. Only works in the public domain and works that have been opted IN to these datasets should be allowable when generating anything that is turned for profit or sold.
