I&#39;m an artist, I find AI using human made art as data as stealing. At the very least, I believe that AI creations should NOT be copywritable. Humans are a huge part of creation, they&#39;re the heart. Stealing parts of human creation, having no skill or heart and then saying no one else can create what took NOTHING to make is insane and will kill art.
