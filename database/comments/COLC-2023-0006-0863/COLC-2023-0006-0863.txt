Please do not make AI work copyrightable! If it is, the market will be flooded with low quality videos, images, and audio trying to take revenue from artists who make quality work - the quality work these AI get trained on in the first place. <br/><br/>If the silicon valley lobbyists are too powerful to make it completely un-copyrightable, a compromise would be making it so AI work is only able to have copyright when the dataset is exclusively trained on work that is public domain or owned by the artist themselves. However I would not recommend this, as its part of the reason unions like SAG-AFTRA are on strike right now. Studios are trying to give artists contracts that would force artists to put their work in studio owned AI datasets, putting them out of a job and not letting the artists themselves have creative control over future works.
