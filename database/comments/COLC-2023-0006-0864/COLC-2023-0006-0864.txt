I think that we need to protect the interest of artists and people by limiting how companies are able to train Ai, enforcing the practice of reasonable compensation to the contributor, and limiting how long training materials can be used.  The current trends of profiting from stolen art and even selfies or the like is disturbing, especially when you consider the age of most negatively impacted. <br/><br/>1. No one should be able to steal art(not just digital art or photography, but also articles, fanfiction, music, selfies, etc. Anything in the range of human expression) from the internet to train a machine to reproduce it. Anything like this should require explicit, individualized consent and reasonable compensation based on the scale of the request.<br/><br/>2). We can&#39;t let things continue as they are now where the average person would struggle to protect their art or selves from being mined and used.(transparency and auditing seems very important for this step)  It also can&#39;t be like social media where using the service is enough &quot;consent&quot; to exploit the users since this makes young people or uninformed peole especially vulnerable. Any program or company in violation of this or the previous point should not only face typical legal and financial repercussions but should also have to suspend their program until it is corrected and removes all traces of their infraction.<br/><br/>3.) Even if consent is given and compensation provided, there needs to be an expiration date for how long the company or ai program can use that piece of data for any reason whatsoever. Maybe 3-5 years max before permission is needed again. This would prevent uneducated or vulnerable people from selling their art/likeliness irrevocably. They should have the chance to pull out or renegotiate if they feel their contribution is being misused or abused or if they feel they were mislead.<br/><br/>In all honesty this should be applied to even to things that are not copyrighted but still originate from a specific person.
