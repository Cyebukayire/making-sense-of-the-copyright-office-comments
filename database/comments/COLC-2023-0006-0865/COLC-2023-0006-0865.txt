The vast majority, if not all Artificial Intelligence programs use unsolicited work to train and fuel their algorithms. AI image generators use artwork without the original creator&rsquo;s consent or any credit given to them, and AI writing programs take the words of other authors and use them, again without the original writer&rsquo;s consent or crediting. Software that uses AI to recreate and imitate someone&rsquo;s voice faces the same issue; many voice actors have spoken out profusely against the rising popularity of their voices being taken and used, often without their knowledge.<br/>This unsolicited and uncredited use of artists&rsquo; work violates the idea of copyright, and thus should be regulated, or prevented completely if regulation is not possible.
