Copyrighted works should not be allowed to be used for generative AI work without explicit written permission for each individual work used as well as compensation. It&#39;s no different than sampling music without permission and royalties. Currently many AI data sets are filled with stolen artwork, photos, and private data. Unlike in music where sampling is done by a person to add spice to work that is still primarily human done, AI generative work is just nothing but sampling without human authorship. It&#39;s meant to replace the human touch as much as possible, rather than to enhance it. <br/><br/>I&#39;ve seen generators made to replicate the style of living working artists(such as Jinji ito) as a means to get the same work without permission or pay. It also makes it more difficult for independent artists such as myself to get commissions because I can&#39;t compete with the price and speed of AI working off of loads of work stolen from my peers or even myself.<br/><br/>If this continues, artists won&#39;t be able to afford to work in the field. Not only is this bad because of the lost jobs but also what it will do to art as a whole. Human made art will always be superior as a machine can&#39;t make anything it hasn&#39;t been fed. And even if you support the idea of ai generative content, what is going to feed the data sets if human artists can&#39;t afford to create anymore?
