AI proponent suggest that AI functions like a human brain. At its most benign, this is PR, at its most malicious, this is a deliberate lie. This mistruth obfuscates a core difference between the two: original thought. An AI can only predictively interpolate its training data - training data that has until this point been unregulated and largely consists of abuses of the very copyrights this agency exists to protect. It is simply atomizing and repackaging the content fed to it - it is not capable of original thought. As a tool, it&rsquo;s very interesting, but a screwdriver cannot hold a copyright. A screwdriver is perhaps a generous comparison, as a human being can use a screwdriver to create an object of originality. But ultimately the semantics are a distraction - these tools cannot exist without the widespread abuse of copyright, and their ability to create works under copyright would be *immensely* damaging and devaluing to all existing works under copyright. It is against the public interest to allow this.
