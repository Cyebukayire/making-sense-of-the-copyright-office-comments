As an artist I&#39;ve spent my entire life learning the skills needed to improve and create better artwork. I see improvement in my work just about everytime I draw. We spend time learning about things like color theory, perspective and proper anatomy. But AI has none of the hardwork that goes into the creation of art. They will use an artist artwork to train the AI to mimic their work without permission and all they have to do is type words into a prompt box. There is no effort that goes into the creation of AI art. I do not think it is right to grant people who steal from hardworking artist the ability to copywrite their &quot;work&quot; because every single image AI generates had to be learned by stealing from others.
