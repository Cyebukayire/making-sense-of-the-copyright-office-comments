My artwork has been stolen and put into AI generators, stolen and sold as NFTS and have had no help to stop people from profiting off of decades of training and hardwork. I do not want AI generated art built off of my work. I want my IP protected. This is a great theft and not innovation. There needs to be protections from my work being stolen, i have never consented.
