Hello, my name is April Hunter. I live in Minnesota and I like to create art and stories. As a creator, I want AI to be regulated. Myself and many other creators do not consent to having our work scraped for AI. I apologize for the vulgar analogy I am about to say, but, scraping content for AI without permission is like stealing chefs&#39; cooking, eating it, regurgitating it back up and claiming it&#39;s your own cooking.
