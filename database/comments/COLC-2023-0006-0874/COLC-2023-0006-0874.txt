It is my strong opinion that 1) no AI should be allowed to be trained on copyrighted works without the copyright holder&rsquo;s permission 2) that artwork produced by generative technology should not be eligible for copyright protection 3) that any company or individual who own or creates an AI that produces plagiarism be liable for that plagiarism 4) that no individual who does not own or program an AI be held responsible for what an AI does in response to their prompts, and 5) that no company, individual or entity be allowed to reproduce a real human being&rsquo;s likeness or voice using generative technology without that person&rsquo;s consent.<br/><br/>For a more in depth explanation on these positions and for personal examples please see the attached document.
