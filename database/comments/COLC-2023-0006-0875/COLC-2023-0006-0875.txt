The current base for Artificial Intelligence(AI) in the fields it&#39;s being used in is not being used fairly nor ethically. As, many artists who have spent years honing their skills, in art, acting, music, writing, or even their voice, are currently being taken and used to create new media without any of their consent or compensation. Works through AI that uses people&#39;s work without pay is unjust and is a form of thief.Not to mention how worrying it is when AI voices are used of non consenting person, hearing your own voice say things you never did is a nightmare and traumatic to some, and the backlash people have received for asking their voice not to be used in these types of AI. Currently the majority of the community behind AI are people who are seeking to abuse it to cut out paying artists, disregarding the blatant theft of artist&#39;s prior works they stole to create their AI&#39;s. With no current major regulations over the field as it grows at a speed faster than anyone outside the filed could expect, it is needed for changes and regulation as to not harm artists who have been stolen from, belittled over not wanting to have their work forced into it, and the manipulation of news and media it can cause with faking political&#39;s voices and faking of video/Visual evidence.
