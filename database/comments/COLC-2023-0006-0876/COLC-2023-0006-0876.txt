AI can cause multiple areas of damage but chiefly among those areas are copyright and fraud. If AI can mimic someone&#39;s face and voice to make it nearly indistinguishable from the real person&#39;s face or voice, it&#39;s easy to see the security risks associated. Furthermore, if AI can &quot;sing&quot;, it&#39;s stealing the voices of many other trained singers who worked for years to refine their technique. The foundation of AI content is that it is generated from already copyrighted materials and then distributed freely without any regard for the consent of those involved. If someone said something damaging in a politician&#39;s voice using AI, it could materially affect that politician. Imagine the havoc it could wreak on the life of a private citizen who doesn&#39;t have the privilege of government position/protection. AI isn&#39;t just about copyright, it&#39;s about safety and PII protection.
