AI trains on protected, copyrighted work too often and without permission or oversight. I like the precedent set by the ruling that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted and believe following that precedent is a good way to protect creators. I also believe that the only way to protect creators and artists now and in the future is to do a reset on the databases, and ensure that they are ONLY trained on material that has been explicitly allowed to them, or material that is free to use and in the public domain. If they retain the copyrighted works in their databases, and the works that have been used without permission by their creators, is that not just stealing?
