I am an individual who makes art for fun, as a hobby. Sometimes this art is posted online, and I don&#39;t make any money from it. I do not believe that owners of AI programs should be allowed to train their AI on my art, without my permission, for profit. I&#39;m more conflicted about AI that does not earn any money. I understand why some artists are unhappy or uncomfortable with it, but I view it more like fanfiction or other transformative works, and think there should be more leeway when there&#39;s no money involved.<br/><br/>Finally, I do not believe that AI-generated work should be copyrightable, unless an artist trains the AI using their own original artwork.
