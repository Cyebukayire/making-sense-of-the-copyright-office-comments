I do not believe that AI works should be copyright protected. These works are generated by mining existing work but do not credit the authors and artists of this work or provide them residuals. This is contrary to the purpose of copyright - to protect the creators of original works. Since AI works are often so closely related to individual author or artist works, it can be understood to circumvent these protections for the original copyright holders. <br/><br/>
