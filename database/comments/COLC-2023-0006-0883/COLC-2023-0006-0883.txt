Ai art that is trained on other artists&#39; work without the artist&#39;s knowledge or consent is theft. <br/><br/>I&#39;m also worried about websites like facebook automatically opting in permission of any user&#39;s content (for example, the website deviantart started its ai model by opting all its users in automatically, leaving deceased users&#39; data at risk) is scraped without explicit knowledge of what ai is and the implications of thier data being scraped.  If an Ai work was trained on someone&#39;s facial features, voice, etc without full informed consent (or the person is coerced into giving consent) it could become a humans rights issue very quickly. Ai poses a risk for revenge porn for this reason. Imagine this happening and these ai produced works, trained on images and artwork not ethically sourced, could be copyrighted. It could become a difficult legal roadblock for an already exploited person or artist, who may not have the resources to go up against large studios or companies. <br/><br/>
