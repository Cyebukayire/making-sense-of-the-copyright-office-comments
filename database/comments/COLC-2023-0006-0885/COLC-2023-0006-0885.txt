AI preys upon actual artists and writers without paying them to scrape their work, so anything made by AI should not be allowed to be used for profit. Anything made by AI should automatically be public domain. <br/><br/>But even if it were public domain, it still detracts from the livelihoods of authors and artists. AI companies should be made to erase their entire databases and then start over anew, paying the creators they scrape from a monthly or yearly licensing fee to include their work in the AI algorithm/database.
