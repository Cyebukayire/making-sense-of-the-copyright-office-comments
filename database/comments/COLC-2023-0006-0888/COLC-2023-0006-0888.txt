AI as it stands currently is not a true artificial intelligence. It is merely an algorithm that scraped available data sources, usually in an unethical manner, to provide results based on a received input. This results in outcomes that are by and large copies from human created works and sources, infringing upon one&#39;s intellectual property. Since these algorithms rely on already existing work, they cannot create anything that is truly unique in its own style. The resulting works are inherently flawed plagiarisms that almost make no sense when examples closely.
