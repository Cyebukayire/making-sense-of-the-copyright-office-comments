Copyright is about protecting a significant amount of work on a creator&#39;s behalf, so they can continue to profit off of it long term and achieve their livelihood.<br/>AI generated work does not involve a significant amount of work, and should not be protected once a network is made. By allowing AI to be copywritten, the floodgates will be open that will harm creators all across the country.<br/>It is also likely that companies and individuals will engage in malicious AI creation to squat on ideas and media, introducing a brand new form of intellectual property trolling.<br/><br/>AI needs to be reigned in so it can slowly be regulated and allow for a stable adjustment to the effects it has on society. Allowing copyright is dangerous and shouldn&#39;t be done.
