Copyright should absolutely not be extended to AI creations. AI content is theft and should not be rewarded. <br/>We also need to create protections so that people cannot be AI generated for profit without their consent, particularly after their death. <br/>At a time when real artists are struggling to pay their bills and fighting for mere scraps of the wealth they generated, it&#39;s important not to further embolden these soulless corporations. Art should be made by humans, not content generating machines who&#39;s sole purpose is to further enrich the greedy 1%.<br/>
