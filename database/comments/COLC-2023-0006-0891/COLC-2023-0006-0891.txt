I think that AI may have excellent uses; however, I am concerned that without safeguards it will become a manner to strip quality out of products and to steal copywritten works. As a doctoral candidate in linguistics with a career in K-12 education, I have produced professional-level translations. I have noticed a decline in translation quality, where a desire to save money on professional translators allows Spanish or Portuguese language content to be poorly constructed and confusing when compared to English language content. A translator can work more effectively using an AI powered dictionary, but AI should not be producing professional translations used in medical or legal environments. In business environments, it is false advertising to declare content available in a language if the content is low, so it should be disclosed in the advertising of the content to avoid false marketing.<br/><br/>This is simply submitted for consideration, but I am alarmed that the customer will absorb a decline in quality from an overreliance on AI without the correct toolmasters to use them, and this will result in personal harm through miscommunication, inefficent business practices, or products being falsely advertised as available in a language when the translation is deficient.<br/><br/>Lastly, I am concerned that AI developers willingness to use public data to generate content (without citation or financially compensating the artists or speakers) will make public speech data less accessible to researchers. The field of linguistics has benefitted immensely from using public speech and written data to conduct research, and it is held to a high ethical standard regarding privacy and just compensation, as all research is. In sharp contrast, AI developers are wildly using public information for financial ends without credit or compensation. This will create a closed and fractured internet: the publication of information will be discouraged by widespread theft without intellectual attribution, and this will slow innovation and the ability of citizens to educate themselves.
