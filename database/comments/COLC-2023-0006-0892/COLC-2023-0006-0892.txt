As a young person, AI content scares me. I&rsquo;m a creative and professional writer. The people I love are artists and other writers. The creative fields need vast legal protection against AI copying or using their work without their permission. It&rsquo;s going to steal content like it already is and it&rsquo;s going to take jobs. Young people are already struggling to pay bills and eat simultaneously. When AI steals ownership of the work we do, it takes the little joy we have from our lives and makes us feel like we have no future. We already know our social security is going next, we have no reproductive rights, we have no retirement funding, we have no faith in the stock market, we don&rsquo;t trust employers, we can&rsquo;t get out of renting, we are going to be swimming in debt forever with student loans and credit cards paying bills&mdash;AI should not get to steal the little joy we have from our creative pursuits just because Disney and Netflix and all the other major corporations want to keep hoarding mass wealth while cutting jobs and underpaying workers.
