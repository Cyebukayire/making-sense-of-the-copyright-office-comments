I don&rsquo;t see why artificial intelligence should be able to be copyrighted. Only original human thought should be able to be copyrighted, and AI is not capable of that. AI is mining and training off of art that is already online, art that was created or written by humans. Can&rsquo;t we just leave authentic writing and art to humans?
