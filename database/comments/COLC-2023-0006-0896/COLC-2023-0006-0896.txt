Because artificially generated content cannot exist without being trained on existing content, it is safe to say that AI generated content is created from this content. The data used for training should not under any circumstances be allowed to be copyrighted content unless the organization training the AI model has the rights to use that copyrighted content for non-personal use (if the AI model they are training will be used for commercial use, they must obtain commercial rights to the data they are training the model on, etc.). <br/><br/>Additionally, because AI generated content is created by a machine, this generated content cannot be subject to copyright. It has not been made by a human. <br/><br/>We are already seeing companies (overseas as well as some in America) turn to AI to replace creative workers. One studio abroad released a cartoon made entirely with AI instead of paying animators; we see many individuals try to sell art that was created with AI. I am a computer programmer: one of the laws of computer programming is that we must not ever create a program that will harm a human. I firmly believe that if AI is allowed to take over the jobs of real creative humans, not only will we be losing the heart of many beautiful art pieces, we will have violated that law by stealing work from these people. Not only that, I believe that allowing AI models to train on content that it does not have the rights to is also a form of harm by allowing the organizations behind these models to steal this content without the rights or monetary compensation to the original creator.<br/><br/>Please - do not allow AI generated work to fall under copyright, and do not allow AI models to train on copyrighted content it does not have the rights to use. I am voter in Oviedo, Florida and will be voting in all upcoming elections with this as a core issue for me.
