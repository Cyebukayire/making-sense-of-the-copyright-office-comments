I believe A.I. to be nothing more than a sham. Its technology is entirely dependent on artists, writers, etc. and wishes to exploit their labor. People deserve compensation for their work and to stand in favor of some ghouls who only wish to steal is wrong. Without the data that they take without consent, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do anything. Compensation seems like a cop-out considering the sheer amount of works that the generators would need to absorb to barely function. It is a shame that our country has to even debate whether the usage of such technology is ethical or not, but I suppose that is the American way and only recently have we begun to right our wrongs. The only reason why I wake up in the morning is the belief in a better future, and technology like A.I. stands in the way of that.
