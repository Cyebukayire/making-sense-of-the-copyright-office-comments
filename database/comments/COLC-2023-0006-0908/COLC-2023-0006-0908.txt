Artificial intelligence must not replace human creators as the author of creative works. As a writer, I&#39;m worried about studios and production companies using AI to generate an unusable &quot;first draft&quot; of a script, then hiring a human writer to &quot;rewrite it&quot; by starting from scratch, only paying them the going rate for a rewrite as opposed to the full payment for an original script.
