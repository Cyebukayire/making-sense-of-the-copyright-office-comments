In regards to AI generated materials being copyrighted, I am very against the premise. While AI-generated art (or rather, images and writing developed by some very advanced applied statistics programs) is not innately unworthy of being called art, the question of how it is trained is still up in the air. The question of AI should revolve around, can it be proven that the visual art and/or writing the AI programs are being trained on was used to train the program with the consent of the original artist? <br/><br/>I don&#39;t think AI should be outlawed, but it also should not be allowed to supplant the work of human writers, as we see with the current writers&#39; strike in Hollywood over executives attempting to use writers merely as editors for AI-generated work, or dispensing with paid work completely. The promise of automation was, once upon a time, that robots would do the hard work so humans could relax. Now it seems that companies are trying to get robots to do the emotionally fulfilling work while humans are relegated to unemployment or drudgery. <br/><br/>The pursuit of happiness, as promised in the Constitution, includes art, and a life of more than just bare survival. I am of the belief that the government, as it is formed at the consent of its citizenry, is duty-bound to take care of that citizenry. It may be that, pragmatically, the government cannot afford to care about whether its citizens are emotionally fulfilled, as long as they can pay the rent and eat. But right now there is a massive trend, as I see it, for companies to penny-pinch by supplementing their short-staffing with computer-generated replacements. I don&#39;t think this trend will survive, but neither do I think it&#39;s right to support these companies&#39; ability to economically harm their employees for the sake of their CEO&#39;s and shareholders&#39; checks. A healthy economy for a country can&#39;t be supported by a vast class of people unable to afford the basic necessities of life. <br/><br/>Rules forbidding the copyright of AI-generated material make it that much harder to replace human artists and employees. If we must be in the position of fighting with investors and CEOs for the right to be merely middle class, then the fight must happen. AI-generated work relies too heavily on the work of existing artists, who it must be taught to emulate, who have not given permission for their work to be used to supplant their careers, to be given the dignity of allowing its generations to be taken seriously.
