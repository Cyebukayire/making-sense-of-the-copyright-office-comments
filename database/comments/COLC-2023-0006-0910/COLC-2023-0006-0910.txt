I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to act to protect the rights of artists and other creatives as well as the general citizenry in its approach to artificial intelligence. The ways in which AI is currently being developed and implemented, in which various AIs are being trained on data that is obtained without the consent of the people from whom it originates - whether this is art in various media, writing, personal data, or anything else - presents a real threat not just to artists&#39; and other creatives&#39; ability to maintain ownership over their work, but also to the privacy of the general population. If artificial intelligence cannot be developed in a careful way that respects copyright, ownership, and privacy, then it is the U.S. government&#39;s responsibility to act to protect its citizens in this area.
