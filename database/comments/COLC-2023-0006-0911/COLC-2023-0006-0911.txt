I do not believe that Artificial Intelligence art, whether visual, musical or written, should be eligible for copyright.<br/><br/>Human artists spend years learning their craft and honing and refining their skills and developing their own particular style. Machine learning does none of these things. AI derived art is derivative at best and plagiaristic at worst. <br/><br/>While a human may create art similar in style to another artist, it is pretty obvious if the artist is copying another artists art or style. AI simply copies the art that has been programmed into it and regurgitates it together so that the style &quot;appears&quot; to be less representative of the originals. But AI cannot create anything original, only a mashup of what it has been exposed to.<br/><br/>Human artist&#39;s style can evolve as their skill set grows and they incorporate new influences into their art. AI does not. AI only incorporates &quot;new&quot; influences in accordance with their algorithm.<br/><br/>Finally, allowing AI created art to be copyrighted by the owner/programmer of the algorithm will allow them to create works solely to sue legitimate artists when their creative works happen to be close enough to an AI created work to make an argument for infringement.<br/><br/>Example: an AI is programmed with Taylor Swift&#39;s entire song catalogue. It then creates new songs based on songs she has already written and they are published and copyrighted. Whenever Taylor Swift writes a new song that becomes popular, it is compared to the AI created catalog for possible similarities to use as the basis of a lawsuit.<br/><br/>Under no circumstance should AI created works be allowed to receive any form of copyright.
