Stop the theft by generative AI models. AI that uses human generated work are stealing copyrighted material. All human copyrighted material must be protected by law from AI theft. For example, an AI generated tv show or movie script is stealing copyrighted work from many human generated and human copyrighted scripts. AI is not capable of creating original work and should not allowed to be copyrighted. Please solidify this in law to protect writers, artists and all other humans who generate original creative work and need that work protected. Thank you.
