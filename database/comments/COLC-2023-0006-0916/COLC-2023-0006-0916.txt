Please refer to attached document for full statement. The following is a provided summary of answers in regards to the posted questions by the agency.<br/><br/>&bull; How AI models should use copyrighted data in training?<br/><br/>- Currently artificial intelligence (AI) is of great concern to many professionals working in the creative industry. These AI programs function by taking pre-existing images, music and writing that is protected by copyright law and creating derivative works (Both commercially and non-commercially) based off of them without permission from the original copyright holders. While creating derivatives is in many cases allowed by copyright law if it is sufficiently transformative, these AI programs themselves are constructed by using copyrighted content and/or content under various forms of the creative commons license. In many cases, these licenses forbid the licensed content to be used in any commercial projects, which several of these AI image creators are.<br/><br/>What most creatives are asking now is for stricter regulations &amp; guidelines on the creation of AI content &amp; the people who are monetarily incentivized to spam it. To give them the tools to not be exploited by reckless usage of their work in AI content creator databases and to protect their rights as copyright holders of their own work. A satisfactory solution would be to only permit the use of content to which AI content creators have the legal rights to use. This would mean that the people creating AI content creators have to ask the copyright holders for the rights to use their content in their AI project or simply use content in the public domain.<br/><br/>Training on copyrighted data should be done on an opt-IN basis only where people who are aware &amp; are willing to give permission to be scraped &amp; trained on. Compared to the severely flawed opt-OUT system where creators have to manually remove themselves. What of artists who do not consent but do not know how to do so? What of cases of an unexpected death of an artist (such as in the case of beloved artist, Qinni, whose sibling is now responsible for opting-Out manually https://twitter.com/QinniArt/status/1591177831626964992). The burden should not be on the artist to remove themselves but on those who have express willingness to participate in the technology. A survey with over 4,000 participants have found that most creatives are unwilling to give our works without permission &amp; compensation (https://twitter.com/Jfields_217/status/1658994450335662081?s=20).<br/><br/>&bull; Should AI-generated material can be copyrighted even without a human involved?<br/><br/>- I stand by the US Copyright Office decision not to grant copyright to non-human entities. I have listened in &ldquo;Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property: Part I &mdash; Interoperability of AI and Copyright Law&rdquo; in all of its entirety &amp; while I appreciate your good office&rsquo;s decision to not grant copyright for AI-generated content, my worries are not assuaged whenever I hear AI enthusiasts make a false equivalence that AI learn like humans &amp; therefore should be granted the same rights in creative endeavors.<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm1NQ_Kqumw&amp;t=6112s<br/><br/>&ldquo;AI learn like humans&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Fair Use&rdquo; defense are commonly espoused by not only the AI community but even by their head developers &amp; CEOs, notably Emad Mostaque &amp; David Holz, to excuse themselves on training on our works without prior consent, credit or compensation.<br/><br/>Notably, even experts &amp; neuroscientists disagree with this notion that machines do not in fact learn like humans typically do (https://theconversation.com/were-told-ai-neural-networks-learn-the-way-humans-do-a-neuroscientist-explains-why-thats-not-the-case-183993)<br/><br/>And as in the above link, even congressman, Mr. Gooden, wanted to differentiate between the two &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried about a middleschool child taking over the music industry.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&bull; How copyright liability would work with AI &amp; how AI could possibly violate publicity rights?<br/><br/>- Several artists have been plagiarized &amp; harassed using our own artworks that were stolen &amp; trained or used in img2img without consent (Please find list of examples in attached). AI Art is being used as automatized art theft. Many AI enthusiasts have publicly stated that they use tools to remove artists&rsquo; watermarks or protection tools such as Glaze by using watermark removers, adversarial cleaners before training on their artworks to create LoRAs, in addition, prompters are knowingly removing watermarks from outputs by typing negative text prompts to remove artists&rsquo; signatures. I would like for your good office to consider addressing the use of living artists&#39; names in prompts when generating AI outputs. Please find that such infringing behavior should be in violation of DMCA Section 1202 &amp; can be penalized for upto $25,000 in fines.<br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to voice our concerns as a creator in the industry &amp; whose works have been taken without consent.
