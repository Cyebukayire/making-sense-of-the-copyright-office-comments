By what right can someone who types prompts into a random generative program claim to own what is produced? They may as well claim to own the results a search engine finds for them.<br/><br/>Worse, if anything, they are violating the claims of the actual artists (whether visual or literary) whose works are taken (often without permission, credit, or payment) to run these randomly generative programs. It has been pointed out frequently and rightly that these AI programs are not actually Artificial Intelligences, but merely plaigarism software. DO NOT ALLOW THIEVES WHO HAVE DONE NO ORIGINAL WORK OF THEIR OWN TO CLAIM COPYRIGHT.
