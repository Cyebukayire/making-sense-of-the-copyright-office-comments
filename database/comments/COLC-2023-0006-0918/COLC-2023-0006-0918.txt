Copyright should only apply to works created by humans. Works created by AI is by definition derivative and not original. (Also, it&#39;s usually just plain bad!) Additionally, the growing popularity of AI takes interest and work away from real human artists. Reserving copyright for only humans encourages people to hire and pay humans, which will create more jobs, decrease unemployment, and positively affect the economy.
