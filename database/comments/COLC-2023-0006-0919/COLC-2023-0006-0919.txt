My primary concern when it comes to AI and its relation to copyright laws is that all widely known and widely used generative AI are trained using examples that are often copied directly from existing works from creators in the same medium, typically without the creators of the AI ever asking for permission. The AI cannot function without this data. This effectively means that works produced by generative AI always contain stolen elements of other people&#39;s works, or are are a mish mash of stolen elements from multiple people&#39;s works. In the most egregious examples, the results are someone else&#39;s piece, down to the signature in the corner, copied exactly with only one or two elements changed, which people who use the AI will then happily claim as their own work. I do not feel generative AI, for this reason, should have any copyright protection, unless and until we are able to ensure that stolen works cannot be used for their training.
