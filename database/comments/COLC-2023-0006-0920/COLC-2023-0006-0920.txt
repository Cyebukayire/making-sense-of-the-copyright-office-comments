Calling AI &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; is misleading. Instead, it&rsquo;s a language model that depends entirely on what source material it has been trained on. It cannot &ldquo;think&rdquo; for itself nor create something new. AI steals copyrighted work. <br/>In the creation of these language models, creators of original content have not been paid nor credited. If a student plagiarizes and does not credit original work, they are punished and can be expelled from school. Why should big companies be treated any differently?<br/>AI language models should not be given a &ldquo;free for all&rdquo; to use any work they want to train their models. Instead, these language models should receive permission and compensate the creator of any work they use to train their model. AI as it currently stands is unethical and a violation of copyrighted works.
