As both a deep appreciator of the arts and as a public school teacher, I implore you to consider curbing AI&#39;s influence and leeway as much as possible. AI involvement in creative media plagiarizes work that is the proverbial blood, sweat, and tears of living, breathing, passionate and worthy artists. If the government&#39;s priority is to protect its people, please commit to protecting the artists and writers from needless competition with a machine. AI&#39;s involvement in creative industries will just devalue any contributions from creatives, who need their work valued in order to live. If AI infringes on that, I fear that America&#39;s creative output will see a decline as more and more artists and writers find their ideas or techniques regurgitated soullessly by a machine that could be used to take their jobs from them, as well.<br/><br/>As a teacher, I believe AI is detrimental to the development of my students. Already, in middle school, my students are talking about how they just look up answers with AI, lacking any understanding of how to verify information-- or even the value of information. These are things I will try to teach them, but the use of AI to account for *any* human need is strikingly bad for all of us. We can make entertainment and beautiful things for each other as people. We don&#39;t need AI to do that. Please consider taking the highest possible actions against the free use of AI in the law. <br/>
