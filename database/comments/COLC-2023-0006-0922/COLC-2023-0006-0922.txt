The burgeoning collection of technologies referred to as &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; are recombination machines - they take input, and rearrange those components into a new output. Machines to turning a collection of inputs into a new output is the story of industrialization, they are nothing new. However, the business environment surrounding them only works when the owners of the machines pay for all their inputs and compensate the prior owners for it. If a car company were found to have stolen the metals its cars were made out of, it would be obligated to either return the materials or, if that weren&#39;t possible, not only compensate whoever they stole it from, but pay exorbitant damages.<br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence operates by breaking down massive libraries of literature and art to recombine them into something comprehensible. However, every artificial intelligence on the market thus far has been trained in part on works of art or literature that the original copyright holders never consented to, if they were aware of it at all (as most were not).<br/><br/>If the owner of an artificial intelligence were able both to ensure every work of art or literature used to train the AI was given voluntarily by the creator or copyright holder, and compensate every creator and copyright holder for the use of their works, then their works could be protected under the same legal principle by which the products of a factory which legally compensated every suppliers of its components are protected (and being that these products are intellectual properties, would likely require at least some involvement of copyright law). However, no such framework exists yet, nor have any of the creators or owners of artificial intelligence nor prospective owners of AI &quot;works&quot;/outputs demonstrated any effort or interest in pursuing such a framework.
