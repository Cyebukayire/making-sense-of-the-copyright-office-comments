As an artist working in TV animation, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time and money honing my craft and my creative voice to build my career to where it stands today. Animation is the ultimate collaborative art form, as it takes so many creatives with varied skills to put together anything from your kids&rsquo; Saturday morning cartoons to the latest Marvel blockbuster. AI is the biggest existential threat to animation labor, and, for that matter, all labor, creative or otherwise. Larger entertainment studios have already begun researching ways to incorporate AI into the production of film and television, primarily as a means to cut costs. Those costs? Wages for hardworking Americans who have put in the same effort I have to make a living off highly specific skilled labor. If we allow AI to be implemented with no regulation, the job market surrounding the American animation industry will collapse, sending a ripple effect across not only the greater Los Angeles economy, but the entire country. We must do everything in our power to harness AI in the most humane, ethical way we can - eliminating an entire industry&rsquo;s worth of jobs is not ethical.
