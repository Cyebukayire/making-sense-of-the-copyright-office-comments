The need for copyright is to protect the intellectual property of individuals in order to promote the progress of science and art. Not only does AI use the very content, typically without permission, that copyright seeks to protect in order to train to generate supposed &quot;new&quot; content, the very lack of a human author speaks to the inability of their to be copyrighted material, as exists in legal precedent. When this issue is boiled down, the very nature of individuals and corporations attempting to copyright AI generated material is to subvert the very idea of copyright. It is not about progress, but the removing a copyright holder in order to make money. AI does not generate new material; it does not progress the interests of the arts or sciences, but rather regurgitates what has already been conceived. Not only should it not be granted copyrights, those training AI with unauthorized access to copyrighted material should be investigated and prevented from infringing on the rights of copyright holders.
