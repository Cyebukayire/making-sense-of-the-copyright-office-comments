Works created by AI should not be able to be copyrighted since they are themselves made from pre-existing materials. Too many, nearly all, were &lsquo;trained&rsquo; on materials without the consent of their creators. <br/>Works created by AI are merely remixes of those pre-existing materials. Imagine if you wanted to make a picture by projecting a dozen photographs of your intended subject at a screen. You might need to tweak how much of any given photograph is used or how it&rsquo;s projected, but the picture you end up with is still just those other photographs, and in this scenario you haven&rsquo;t asked anybody if you could use their pictures. That&rsquo;s AI.
