Work generated through AI or machine learning should not and must not be protected by copyright law. Even if one were to disregard how such tools already use the protected works of real humans (i.e. existing photographs, documents, drawings, even models own physical likenesses) it still wouldn&rsquo;t change the fact that copyright was created to protect the work and well being of human beings. Human beings who will be unable to make a living creating art should technology stealing and approximating their art be given legal credibility.<br/><br/>With the lack of substantial legislative overreach and no internal regulation from companies using or producing AI art, your power represents a crucial opportunity to prevent millions of artists losing their jobs, their livelihoods, their chance to create without fear of exploitation. It is also a chance to fight against an industry who intends to make the world a worse place. Please, fight to protect humans and art and not to protect the ambitions of a few tech companies and the corporations who intend to use their product to devalue life as we know it.
