Hi,I am an independent artist, programmer and creative very concerned with the current state of Gen-AI and what the future holds for artists and creatives.<br/><br/>I would like to focus my comment on image generators and the art field, but I know there is similar disruptions all over the field, including actors, voice-actors and photographers.<br/><br/>I believe that the in the current sate, image gen-AI (eg. StableDiffusion, Midjourney etc.) are very much abused and are very much copyright violations. They are very damaging to the creative industries as a whole, is unethical, and have already shown misuse both by the developers of those software and by the users on the internet.<br/><br/>While the technologies that these Gen-AI(s) uses are not inherently evil or unethical, the current implementations of these softwares require scrapings of copyrighted information on the internet fed into it&#39;s libraries to function and give any desirable output. <br/><br/>If you go to haveibeentrained.com, and search the names of any famous artist, or reverse search image of any artwork, you would definitely see a lot of scraped and copyrighted images there. These images were trained by any AI trained with the LAION-5B(5 billion) dataset, and is the core of gen-AI products like StableDiffusion and Midjourney.(See attached)<br/><br/>Essentially, these AI companies are using the data stole from the artists and photographers for free, to make a product that distrubutes said data for profit. It forces the creatives to compete with themselves while the companies makes all the profit. Artists are rarely, if not at all compensated for the data that was non-consensually scraped.<br/><br/>None of this process really has any human level intelligence behind them, as these programs are not an actual intelligence, but lossy compression algorithms with input and output. It&#39;s more of a content remixing machine. The associaltion with AI is purely marketing &quot;hype&quot;.<br/><br/>And there has been some very disturbing misuses of these generators too. Including impersonation, scams, potential defimations. But some most extreme cases include making incredibly realistic pornography of children, hate speech etc.<br/><br/>The Times article: The Case Against AI Everything, Everywhere, All at Once (https://time.com/6302761/ai-risks-autonomy/) Has some great points about the behaviors of these companies and the dangers these technologies can pose, be it social, economical or environmental.<br/><br/>Thus, while I agree that AI could have real uses, I believe that the these current practices of these companies must not be allowed and must be regulated. <br/><br/>We should stand by humans and not hurt the beautiful communities  and industries we already have for a dangerous, unethical system that requires exploitation to work.<br/><br/>And this is why I urge the US to take actions on these companies and lead the world in regulations in this field, allow creatives who care about their work and their impact thrive, ensuring the companies are held accountable when it comes to the contents it can generate and the sources of those data be ethically sourced.<br/><br/>
