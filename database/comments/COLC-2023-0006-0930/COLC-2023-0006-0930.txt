I believe that strict guidelines should be released for computer generated media. Many AI generation tools pull from works without the consent of authors, and thus do not pay the actual authors or artists used to &quot;train&quot; the AI datasets any royalties. AI has function as a tool, but every dataset used by an AI to create works should be public and easily accessible. Any copyrighted AI works need to have certified consent by every owner of every work used in their dataset, and pay the appropriate royalties to said owners. I also believe that every computer program used by artists and authors to create (google documents, adobe, etc.) who&#39;s companies desire to use their cloud databases for AI need to make this an opt-in process. An opt-out process puts those under NDA at risk, and can for example breach the terms of copyright of other studio&#39;s whos employees are using these tools such as Disney animators.
