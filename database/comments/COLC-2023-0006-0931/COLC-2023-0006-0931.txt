My name is Jayla Chery, and I am a student. If AI continues in the direction it is headed, it will place many people out of jobs, ruin the images of many through malicious deepfakes, and even steal people&#39;s art, video games, writing, music and even their own likeness in movies by big corporations. AI needs to be regulated so that no one is unfairly used and stripped of their humanity by a machine that doesn&#39;t think. Please consider this, and how many people will be targeted and oppressed regardless of age, sexual or gender identity, race, ethnicity, disability, and background
