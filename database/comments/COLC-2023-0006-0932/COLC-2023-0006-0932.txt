AI should not freely use the work of others to generate content. People can be inspired by one another and influenced. AI is programmed to act and create in certain ways. It can not be inspired or influenced. It can only take the works of others and puzzle piece it together into something new. That is not transformative. It&#39;s not even creative. AI should only generate content with materials that have the consent of the original creator. Those original creators should have the right to profit off a machine using their original work to create something new. If AI were creating new movies by using the footage of every existing movie, Hollywood would want their cut. Artists and writers deserve the same respect.
