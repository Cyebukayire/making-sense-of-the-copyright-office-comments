To date all AI or large language, model systems have scraped, copyrighted work without compensation to the owners of those copyrights to generate their systems. Not only do I believe that AI generated content is not human created, and therefore in eligible for copyright, but I also believe that the AI and large language model systems themselves are in violation of existing copyright law, with the possible exclusion of purely not-for-profit endeavors.
