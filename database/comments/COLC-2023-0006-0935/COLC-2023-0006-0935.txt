Since Artificial Intelligence is a conglomeration of stolen content (much of it already copyrighted) it is legally and ethically untenable to allow AI &quot;works&quot; to be copyrighted. Writers, videographers, musicians, and artists are all required to follow copyright laws and are often penalized for valid use of copyrighted work under fair use rules. (ie Youtube videographers getting frivolous DMCA take down claims for videos that analyze or critique copyrighted works.) So it&#39;s untenable for AI users to come in and a) use stolen copyrighted material and b) copyright that stolen material. This will be disastrous for so many industries, and it&#39;s also unethical to allow AI users to bypass the standards and rules that human artists are held to. We are not required to bend the knee to the billionaire tech bros who want to create a dystopia where they&#39;re in charge or publishing/ Hollywood studio executives who want to profit off of art at the expense of the artists who make it.
