As any writer knows, if we write to a prompt, the prompter holds no ownership over our text. You cannot copyright an idea. And the user of the LLM has no other role in the creation of the text. Therefore, the user of a LLM cannot be considered the author/copyright holder.<br/><br/>The creator of an LLM may have written many pieces of code, and those pieces of code may be copyrighted. However, what users create with this code cannot be under their copyright, or else, every website made with Wordpress, every story written in google docs, and every game made in Gamemaker Studio should be under copyright to the owners of the code. As this is not the case, the creator of the LLM cannot be the copyright holder of the products of an LLM.<br/><br/>If an author who was also a reasonable coder built a neural net to process their own writing and produce text based only on that data source, perhaps they have a claim to the ownership of the produced work, in the way Surrealist Games often use randomness and arbitrary rules to create works. But in surrealism, the incorporation of randomness was meant to spark inspiration, deconstruct meaning, and encourage thought, not replace those three things. Once we step outside of the author mining their own material, we have problems. Who has copyright over the product of a game of Exquisite Corpse? No one? Or everyone who participated? With an LLM, every author who is included in the dataset has contributed their words and the statistical significance of their words to the output. Thus every author has a claim to copyright, and has had an effect on the product. By using &#39;the + Noun&#39; in an orderly way they have contributed to the prevalence of &#39;the + Noun&#39;s in the output. As the datasets are not clearly listed and available, the authors are not being credited, and any output cannot be copyrighted because we do not even know who the copyright holders should be!<br/><br/>Thus: copyright belongs to the authors of the texts included in the dataset, as they have contributed their creativity and knowledge of the language to the output as in any game of exquisite corpse.<br/><br/>In sum, a LLM is a tool built from an illegally obtained dataset that produces worthless content.
