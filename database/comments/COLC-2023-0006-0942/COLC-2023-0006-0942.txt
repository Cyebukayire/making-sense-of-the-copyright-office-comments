Hello,<br/><br/>I&#39;m Raymond, I work as an independent illustrator and designer. I work primarily in digital art, and have my medium written off by folks because they presume that all it takes to make digital work was press a button, when in reality I pour more time into my digital work than I did painting or drawing traditionally.  Five years ago, the idea that you could press a button and instantaneously have a newly created image was laughable, but now we do have this technology, we&#39;ve been calling at AI.  Although I would argue our current AI programs don&#39;t actually posses any form of artificial intelligence, that is the name I will go with throughout this comment.<br/> <br/>Current AI technology is based on machine learning, which limits the output pretty significantly.  These AI learn how to create images by looking at several other images of the same type of subject matter, and then re-create an approximation of what it believes the user is asking for.  So far major AI programs have done without the permission of image copyright holders like artists and photographers, meaning any output made by these programs is most likely using copyrighted imagery without permission of the original creator.<br/><br/>On top of this, there is no creative decisions being made by the user, they give a prompt and then are given a number of images (depending on the program used) as output.  The user is deciding between choices that have been given to it by a machine and nothing more.  If myself and a friend decide to create the same type of illustration, with myself using digital art software and my friend using an AI program our processes look extremely different: I create sketches first to come up with ideas, when I have a sketch I like I move different elements to finalize my composition, create line art by refining my sketch lines, fill in flat colors, and render shading.  While I am taking these steps, I am making new decisions about my piece.  Everything included in the piece is a decision I make: lighting, symbolism, poses, expression, color scheme, etc.  All of that is done for each element in the drawing, so depending on how complex my idea is I am looking at potentially 2-3 days worth of work minimum.  My friend on the other hand who is using an AI program just needs to put that same prompt into the program.  They may need to try a couple different prompts to get better results, but they will have a visually comparable piece in minutes.  The only decision they made was which AI-generated image to go with.  They may like the pose and lighting and colors that the AI generated but they did not come up with that idea on their own, and neither did AI for that matter, it simply copied what it saw other images do.<br/><br/>I support the US Copyright Office&#39;s most recent decision involving Stephen Thaler to refuse copyright an AI-generated image.  These images do not involve human creation on any meaningful level, I am glad to see that the US Copyright Office understands that.  That decision gave me some hope as an artist, I hope you will keep with that line of thinking.
