First, what exists right now is not artificial intelligence except in marketing terms. We absolutely should not provide any automatic copyright to something generated by the current crops of &quot;artificial intelligences.&quot; If we ever get to an actual AGI, this comment could be reconsidered. At the moment, copyright should only be granted when the majority of a piece of work is created by human intelligence. It is not and should not be sufficient for a tool to create copyrightable work simply by virtue of human ownership.<br/>There are a number of questions about the use of currently copyrighted works being copied wholesale by these &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; models. Fair use must be enforced for AI models. <br/>The failure of models that have created actual copies of certain art works should not be ignored. It would be impossible for someone using one of these models to determine how close the created work is to someone else&#39;s copyrighted work, and therefore to determine whether they are violating someone else&#39;s copyright, thus it is up to the models to provide this information&mdash; but technically speaking, they cannot do that because of how the models are written. <br/>Further, choosing to leave enforcement of one&#39;s copyright to individuals in the case of these AI models that have used copyrighted material as their base training data would necessarily invalidate the current principle (as I know it) that a copyright exists without registering the copyrighted work.
