I am very concerned about the lack of protections afforded to all types of creatives with this boom of machine learning (&quot;artificial intelligence&quot;).<br/>The sourcing of their machine learning so far has been largely unethical and nonconsenual.<br/>I&#39;d like there to be a requirement for any business running a machine learning program to get permission from any artist (painters, sketch artists, musicians, voice actors, actors, writers, etc) to have access to their work or likeness.<br/><br/>I have watched a close friend have their voice taken and used to say whatever the person wanted, and they have no way of getting those videos removed because they don&#39;t violate any current laws or rules on the sites they&#39;re up on.<br/>It&#39;s a disturbing and honestly very scary situation to be in.<br/><br/>In short, I want to see regulations on these types of programs. I want to see protections for creatives and for ANYONE who shares their likeness online whether their voice or their face.
