I am of the opinion that content generated via Artificial Intelligence violates copyright law. The Ai&rsquo;s used to generate content such as photos or pieces of text must be trained by giving it premade content which is often times given to the Ai&rsquo;s without the permission of the original creators of the premade content. Furthermore, while people who use Ai&rsquo;s to generate content will often times claim ownership over said content, because they are not the ones actually making it - instead letting an Ai do all the hard work - such claims of ownership must be null and void since they had an Ai make the content, likely after training it with stolen legitimate works.
