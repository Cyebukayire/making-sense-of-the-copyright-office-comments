AI being used to scrape people&#39;s artworks, writing, and creative endeavors is extremely concerning, as most of these databases are gathered without the original creators creators consent. This cannot remain unchecked. I have seen people selling images created with AI image creator tools that have obviously been sourced from certain artists property. This cannot remain unchecked. There needs to be clear legal outlines for gathering images and writing for databses without creators consent and also what it means in terms of copyright for these generates images because this is deplorable
