I don&rsquo;t believe AI should be able or allowed to use copyrighted material to make new art. More than that, I don&rsquo;t believe AI art should be copyrighted, as so far it&rsquo;s proven to be a clever jumble of other people&rsquo;s works. In the amount of time that AI has been in use, artists have seen severe drops in their income because people will use AI to recreate art they like. This is unfair to artists and unfair to consumers as well. The database for AI art should be scrubbed and redone with artwork that has explicit consent to be used.
