AI is incredibly harmful towards creatives and should be heavily regulated. The ability for AI &ldquo;artists&rdquo; to feed an someone&rsquo;s art into a machine and get infinite art back without crediting the original artist, paying them, or even getting their consent is unacceptable. As a digital artist, I am afraid to post my art anywhere online because I am terrified of someone scraping my art and committing, essentially, theft of my work. AI works should not be allowed to be copyrighted, whether they are art, writing, voice clips, etc.
