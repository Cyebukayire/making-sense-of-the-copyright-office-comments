Unregulated AI is extremely dangerous and not only puts jobs, but human lives at risk. Its ability to be used to spread misinformation is unprecedented, and bad actor can use this to target individuals or groups in ways never imaginable, putting people at serious risk. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. The fact that someone&rsquo;s original ideas can be scraped and used in ways they didn&rsquo;t consent to or are not compensated for is frankly ghoulish, and should not be normalized. Countless lively hoods are at risk due to the rise of AI, which is trained on those very same people&rsquo;s hard work. Government regulation on AI will in no way stifle innovation or creativity, and will only help create a safer world for everyone.
