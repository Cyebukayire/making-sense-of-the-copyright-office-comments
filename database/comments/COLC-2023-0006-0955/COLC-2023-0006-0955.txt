The data comes from all people who have touched the internet. If collective data of people is subject to ownership by a company or singular person then I have to say that&rsquo;s pretty stupid and only helps that person or company and nobody will benefit. We will basically be living in a worse Robocop scenario. AI should be open source (as the sources are open to the &ldquo;creators&rdquo;) and freely available to allow human ingenuity to make AI flourish. Closing it and locking down ownership means you hamstring AI progress in the USA only and you allow for the ingenuity to occur only from nefarious or non-US sources. Your companies will put their earnings before your national security, as evident in Microsoft&rsquo;s actions after their recent security breaches. You would put AI-level security concerns in *their* hands? If so, I pity you, but I envy your ignorance. Your life must be so simple.
