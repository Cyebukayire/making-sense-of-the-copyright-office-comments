My job is voice acting, it is how I pay rent, utilities, how I survive. My livelihood. AI has the potential to be deeply detrimental to my career. Fans have already started stealing my voice and making me sing songs and say things I would never say. If they made me say something racist for example it could ruin my entire career. If companies can use ai to make my voice say anything, why would they pay me for work when they can just use ai? It has the potential to rip away my entire career and ability to make money from me. If you give people the power to copyright from content created with ai, that means they can get away with not paying artists. It will be nothing short of detrimental for all types of artists including us voice actors. It is crucial to not allow people to use people&#39;s existing work--I am in many shows and videogames. Them taking what I&#39;ve said and feeding it into ai is stealing part of what makes me who I am, my voice. I have a right to my voice, and for others to not take my voice from existing work and puppet me and force to say things I never consented to. We need protections from people using our existing work and from people being allowed to copyright material that was made with ai.
