I am highly concerned with the ease these tools can be used to commit fraud or scams, particularly relating to creative works, and impersonation. The output of such tools does not always reveal the input, which is highly problematic when being used to draw on copywritten work. While generating something directly from anothers work, it does at first appear to be transformative, as the result is something the original author could have made, but technically didnt, it is still composed of the effort of the original author and has a large potential to harm the original author by sheer speed and volume at which generated works can be created. As a consumer, this is truly sad as what makes artistic work special is not only the content itself, but also the people behind the content, their intent, their process. Of tools like these are not disclosed to consumers, so much of the creative work is lost, or rather is voided.
