AI needs to be held accountable. The fact that there&#39;s so much fear online around AI scraping your art or your writing or just your *typing style*, it needs to stop. Please, we just need a way to be sure that, apart from manually inserting our own art in any form, AI isn&#39;t being trained on it. I understand that is a nigh impossible task without regulating the ever loving hell out of it, but it&#39;s scary thinking that a program can pump out imitations of art and be praised for it, or copy someone&#39;s voice or face. Can you even imagine the security concerns there? So many people use face ID, and being able to just go to some AI site and pull up whatever you need to get past someone&#39;s security on their phone or whatever? Eugh. AI is not a replacement for artists, in any form. Writing is art. Acting is art. Painting is art. AI is not.
