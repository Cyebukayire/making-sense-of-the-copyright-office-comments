AI does not form anything without human intervention and uses human writing to create copy. Thus only humans and NOT AI should have the benefits of copyright protection. Thus anything haphazardly assembled solely with AI and not created by human creativity should also not receive the protection of copyright. AI is nothing more than a pasta maker machine and we don&#39;t protect the rights and privileges of the pasta making machine, just the pasta chef.
