Hello. This is a personal comment. I do not speak for any group, but I personally file trademarks for my state. I can only speak for myself. It is my belief that AI being copyrightable, and by extension the trademark tangential implications would cause uproar, confusion, and lack of understanding of what is happening when AI technology is used to create something that is thought to be new and copyrightable. Anecdotally, I am familiar with authors and artists who have had their personally owned creations &#39;scraped&#39; by large-company owned AI tools to feed into their machine learning and use for their own purposes. If is not widely understood, I believe it would cause misunderstandings and be very, very expensive. At every stage, this would create more work for you, and for me. The questions I would now have to answer about law that does not yet exist in my state&#39;s statutes...I cannot imagine it would be any better. And knowing your work queue, which as I understand it stands at October 2022, do you really want to add to your registrations when you have to reject them for corrections even more? There&#39;s an argument for anyone in the patent and trademark office who manages to read this...you are behind on staffing and do not have time for this. It&#39;s not time yet when we do not understand as a society how the AI machine learning is being used. I am dreading the phone calls and emails I will have to field if this becomes a thing in my trademark work world, and let me tell you it will not be pretty at the Federal level, so good luck with that. Again, I speak not for my workplace, I just work there.
