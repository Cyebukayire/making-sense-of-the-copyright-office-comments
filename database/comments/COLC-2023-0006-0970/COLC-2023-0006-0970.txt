People&#39;s blatant stealing of art and any images on websites like twitter or Deviant art all being thrown into the AI&#39;s database should honestly mean that any AI generated image is not copyrightable. In some capacity, it is stolen art. <br/><br/>Also, websites should not be allowed to feed anything into an AI database without people&#39;s consent/opting in. Using a website and &quot;agreeing to use terms and conditions&quot; is not consent in this case, it&#39;s trickery. Having it as a separate specific terms for just AI database feeding would be fine, but again, default is already opted out.
