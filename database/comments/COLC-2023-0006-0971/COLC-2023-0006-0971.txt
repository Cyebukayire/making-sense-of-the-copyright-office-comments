I am a student at the Savannah College of Art and Design who will soon be graduating, and I feel that AI art should not be defended by copyright law. As I understand it, copyright exists to protect the unique expression of ideas, which AI generation is categorically not; it is a device that turns human art into an algorithm and outputs something that mathematically resembles our work. <br/><br/>Copyright defends ideas, and AI does not create those; it doesn&rsquo;t think. It is not a brain. It is, again, a mathematical code.<br/><br/>Some people try to argue that the human brain does the same thing, but I feel that this is categorically false. Being an artist myself, I can tell you with certainty that is downright impossible for a human to replicate the art they see. Any inspiration we get is filtered through the lens of our own experience and shaped by our current skill level, producing work with actual thought behind it. I will reiterate: AI does not think. I feel that we should be protecting artists&mdash;humans&mdash;before catering to an unfeeling algorithm.
