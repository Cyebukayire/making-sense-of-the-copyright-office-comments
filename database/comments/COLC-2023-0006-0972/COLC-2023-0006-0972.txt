AI is extremely dangerous to every field imaginable. this &quot;tool&quot; cannot be allowed to have free range to spread. it has already stolen thousands upon thousands of peoples original work, copyrighted material and sensitive and private information and it has made millions of people lose their jobs and lively hoods, no one cares until it comes for you, and one day you&#39;ll look back at the AI doing your job and wish you stepped in when it was still ruining the lives of the creatives you have no compassion for.
