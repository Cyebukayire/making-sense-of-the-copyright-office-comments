Artificial Intelligence, while a powerful tool with the capability to generate images, writing, and much more, has far too many ethical dilemmas for it&rsquo;s work to be cooyrighted. An AI is entirely dependent upon the data set on which it is trained, and thus nothing it &ldquo;creates&rdquo; is truly its creation. It is an amalgamation of information taken from a spreadsheet, with no input itself other then a vague attempt to satisfy conditions it is presented with. Credit should belong to all of the creators whose work was taken by a machine to create these statistical approximations of intellectual property.
