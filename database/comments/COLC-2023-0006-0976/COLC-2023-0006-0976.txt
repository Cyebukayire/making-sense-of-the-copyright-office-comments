I believe that anything created through generative AI tools, including, but not limited to: images, text, and audio such as voices, should not receive any copyright protection of any kind. Generative AI models should instead be heavily regulated and have their entire datasets deleted and require an opt-in from the original source for any data to be added. The data used in Generative AI, in their current form, uses data, such as artwork, and voice audio, scraped from the internet, as an example, without consent of the original creators. Commercial use of AI generated content can have an immensely negative affect on the economy by taking away potentially most, if not all, forms of revenue from the freelance creative market. Artists, writers, and voice actor as well as other occupations affected by its use, would have their craft severely exploited with no compensation, to the point no longer being sustainable, and there for unable to flow money back into the economy.
