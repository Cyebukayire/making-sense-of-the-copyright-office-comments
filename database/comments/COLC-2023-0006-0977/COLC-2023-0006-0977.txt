Copyright should not be extended to AI produced material. Not only is it not a product of human creation, most of the common AI models have an ambiguous relationship to existing copyrighted works. Without complete transparency on the data an AI models is trained on and more clarity about what the model is pulling from in constructing its product, AI created material may itself be in violation of copyrighted material. While it may not be technologically possible (yet) to fully and clearly label the influences used in AI output, there should be regulations that require transparency in training data to determine whether or not copyrighted texts were used without permission.
