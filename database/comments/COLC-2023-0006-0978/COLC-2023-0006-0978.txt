I believe that it should not be legal to copyright AI generated materials. AI generated materials are not original, they are based on plagiarism of the original (and often copyrighted) work done by human creators. I think that machine learning programs trained on copyrighted materials are violating the copyright and that they should be completely demolished and retrained on non-copyrighted materials.
