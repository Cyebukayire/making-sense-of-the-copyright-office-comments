The nature of AI means that no matter how much co-authorship a human may claim, their input is insignificant compared to the amount of output that is proportionally done by the AI in a fully undirected way (compared to say a typewriter, where it is hard to argue the typewriter is doing the larger effort).  Maybe a system can create a copywritten work, but it would be incorrect in my opinion to allow humans to claim any ownership over works done in unison with these tools.
