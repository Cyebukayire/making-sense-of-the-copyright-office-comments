AI generated art should not now or ever be allowed to be copyrighted. AI are trained using thousands of artworks without using permission, giving credit, or any sort of financial compensation. There is nothing transformative about a machine stealing from thousands of artists, cutting up their work, and piecing it back together. Nothing created by artificial intelligence should be allowed to be copyrighted, it is an insult to every artists whose work is taken unwillingly and literally theft.
