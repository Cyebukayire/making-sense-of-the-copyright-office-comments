It is very important that the interpretation of the law remain that there must be a HUMAN AUTHOR in order to copyright a work.  <br/><br/>No one person or organization should be able to copyright a work made using AI, as the data set that the computer and artificial intelligence uses is generated by hundreds (if not millions) of other people from data that was included in the data set that the computer compiles into a newly generated work.  The AI image, written work, or other expression should not be owned by a single person or company when it was generated by the work of many.  The inclusion of significant human input is needed to properly assign and define copyright ownership.  The interpretation of the law should stay the same and require a human&#39;s effort to allow a work to be copyrighted.
