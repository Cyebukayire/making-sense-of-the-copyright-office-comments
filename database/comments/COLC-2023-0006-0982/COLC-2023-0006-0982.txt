To whom it may concern,<br/><br/>My name is Grant Sterling, I have been an artist my entire 24 years of life, it is my passion, my talent, and it is a labor of love that the people behind AI seek to exploit.<br/><br/>AI is trained on copyrighted works, there is no way around it, AI &quot;art&quot; is theft of intellectual property. It is a fools errand to attempt to ensure that no copyrighted work is used in its databases when these models scrape the internet, copyrighted art is often re-uploaded by fans and admirers of the work to other websites, often without the original artists knowledge or consent.<br/><br/>Its still early in the AI game, but even now when I try to look up reference materials for commissions, studies, and other art I am bombarded with AI sludge, utterly unusable in art studies or reference as the proportions are not rooted in reality, just the smearings of a machine.<br/><br/>On top of this, if AI &quot;art&quot; is allowed to be copyrighted millions of people will lose their jobs, all while watching their labor and work be used to feed a machine. That many people losing their homes could cause a housing collapse far worse then 2008, it could cause a second great depression.<br/><br/>Allowing AI to be copyrighted is a bad idea from an artistic, humanitarian, and economic perspective, and I ask that you don&#39;t cave to the big interests looking to make this AI dystopia our reality.<br/><br/>Grant Sterling
