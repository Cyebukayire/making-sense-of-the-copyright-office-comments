AI is a fundamental flawed medium.  It&#39;s basis is on the programed absorption of other creations. It has no true creativity.  Unlike a human remix of a song these algorithms have no recourse to claims of unique creation.  AI represents a theft of artistry as a concept in favor of programmable processes.  An algorithm has no rights to its creative process. It has no creative process.  Each source material is stolen in the process of AI art. Claims to the contrary are a insult to the creative process of Humankind.
