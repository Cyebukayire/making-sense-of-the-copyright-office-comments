Hi. I am someone who writes content for an extensive hobby. I also do voice acting, and plan to go into actual acting one day. And AI has put all of that in jeopardy. <br/>I write on a site called Archive Of Our Own, or AO3, which mainly houses fanfiction (protected by the Organization of Transformative Works under Fair Use /Free Use, one of the two) and it was scanned by an AI bot and data was stolen from these stories. As such, many people- myself included- have locked our works so only those with an account can read them. Furthermore, I and many other people have created our own workskin to prevent people from copy-pasting our works into AI to train or write more of. I am an advocate for the availability of fanfiction, and believe you shouldn&#39;t need an account on sites to read it, but due to AI, it&#39;s the only way I can protect my works.<br/>Many voice actors, myself included, also despise AI. Specifically the kind that can mimic voices. These things steal our likeness and use it for their own projects, without paying us. And actors in general don&#39;t like AI- as people are striking due to studios wanting to use AI to steal their likeness and not pay them for it.<br/>I believe there is a very simple solution to AI in general, one to make it actually ethical; AI MUST be trained on things submitted to the AI itself. An artist must consent and submit their work to the AI for it to be used, and they must also be allowed to say &quot;actually, I changed my mind. Delete the data of my work&quot;, or &quot;That wasn&#39;t me who submitted that, delete that data&quot;. AI and AI sites that do not comply should be taken down, deleted, ect.
