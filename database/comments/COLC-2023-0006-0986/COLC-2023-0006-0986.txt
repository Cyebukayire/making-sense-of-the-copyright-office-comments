I believe AI generated content cannot be copyrighted, as long as a single piece of the training material for the AI is not proprietary to the organization or individual seeking to copyright its creation. This is not the human mind taking inspiration from the work of others, but a machine that seeks to mimic stolen or scraped material. Allowing AI materials to be copyrighted will both devastate artists and their industry in a variety of fields, but make the theft of ideas and content, even currently copyrighted content, standard in the industry, thereby destroying the whole point of copyrights in the first place. They will not improve art, and they will not allow creators to live from their inventions and bold steps forward. Innovation would be meaningless.
