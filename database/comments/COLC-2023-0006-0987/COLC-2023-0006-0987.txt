The so called art that is art of an AI, is art stolen, traced over, used against the original creators wills. To allow a copyright on AI art is to basically say that real artists, those who pour their sweat blood and tears into work, are not worthy of the respect they as artists deserve. Why would they continue making art, writing, creating music, acting, drawing, painting, etc., if their voices, their specific medium, are taken by these so call AI Artists?
