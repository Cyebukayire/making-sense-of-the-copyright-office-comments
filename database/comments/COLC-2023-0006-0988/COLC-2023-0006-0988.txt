&ldquo;Language models, art generators, and the (currently experimental) video generators which are named &quot;AI&quot; are trained by exposure to data sets. In order for an AI to produce coherent, cogent,  and lifelike results, those data sets must be language OR artwork, OR video produced by real humans. In the case of most of the dominant &quot;AI&quot;  available on the internet today, these data sets were produced by  &quot;scraping,&quot; the process of moving from one webpage to the next in search of publicly available information--I stress, publicly available, but  NOT COPYRIGHT FREE. As a result, it seems apparent right out of the gate that these &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; models cannot be trusted to produce material that can be copyrighted. <br/><br/>&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;  is not like an artist. It cannot produce an original work. If it produces a drawing of an orange, that drawing is inexorably and inextricably linked to all the other (likely copyrighted) pieces of art from which the AI learned. <br/><br/>As a consumer and a producer of writing and digital artwork, I cannot overstate how strongly I oppose even the idea of &quot;AI&quot; generated content being allowed anything even approaching copyright, because &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; as it now stands cannot create--it can only reproduce what it has seen. <br/><br/>Anything an AI makes cannot be copyrighted. Anything made by an AI should be ipso facto non-restricted public domain unless modified significantly (arbitrary number, modified by 50% or more) by a human. Further, there must be some way for humans to &quot;opt out&quot; of inclusion in AI training data sets. There should be significant financial and potential civil penalties for companies who trawl the web indiscriminately to rob writers and artists around the world. Thank you for your time, and  please make the right decision to ensure that future generations will be  able not only to create but to envision a life and secure a livelihood  as creators.&ldquo;
