As a creative across multiple medias (textiles, art, and writing, to name a few relevant to this matter), it is incredibly important to me for the government to keep AI on a tight, tight leash. Already, AI has impacted communities I&#39;m in online&mdash;artists are seeing less commissions, and so are authors. The AI aren&#39;t just being trained with copyrighted material, either&mdash;people are feeding fanfiction and fanart, which are already sensitive issues legally, to their AI and ripping off artists and authors who aren&#39;t even being paid for their art in the first place!<br/><br/>There is little to no effort put in by the people using AI in this manner, beyond a handful of words to be fed as prompts to the AI. Most of the people using AI in this manner are using pirated books, which they have admitted themselves when others online have asked them how to make an AI book.<br/><br/>Things are no different when it comes to art. These AI &quot;creators&quot; are feeding the program artwork of well-known artists to create new &quot;art&quot;. A lot of this art is paywalled in some manner, be that by Discord (a messaging service which puts an emphasis on connecting creators to their fans) or on Patreon (a site where people can subscribe to an artist&#39;s private work, be that written, drawn, animated, filmed, etcetera), or simply an artist or character designer.<br/><br/>The ways in which AI-created works can be published, much less sold, need to be restricted as much as possible. The people maintaining the AI should have to have the consent of the party whose content they&#39;re feeding to the program. They should not only credit that person, but that person should get a portion of the profits depending on how much of the work was made based on their content. This must be a documented process, and must be fully reversible if the person decides they don&#39;t want that AI to have access to their works anymore.<br/><br/>With my reasonable suggestions out of the way, and my perspective shown, I am now going to briefly go over my actual opinions.<br/><br/>I do not believe that people should be able to make money off of artificial intelligence generated works unless the only content in it is something they made themselves. I&#39;ve already seen this be messy with simple bots, much less AI&mdash;if you go under an image on twitter and comment &quot;I&#39;d love to see this on a shirt,&quot; or anything similar, you will have a link to purchase it no less than five minutes later, from a website owned by someone who is not the creator of the image. That is how this AI nonsense is going to go, too. I think it should be a tool for learning, and I do think that AI can help in areas like climate-friendly cities or safer airplanes and things along that nature&mdash;but I don&#39;t think it should be used to filter applicants for jobs, or predicting &#39;probable criminals&#39; and leading innocent people to be arrested, or make money with.
