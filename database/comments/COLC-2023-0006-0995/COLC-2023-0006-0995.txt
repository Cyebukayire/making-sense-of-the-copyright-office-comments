So-called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is not intelligence. It is a purpose-made category of software developed by real people with very specific goals and tasks in mind. It is no different in this sense from any other type of computer program or application.<br/><br/>Training data for AI models should be made available on a strictly opt-in basis, requiring explicit approval from the creator of the data. Furthermore, any attempts to develop an AI that produces output which infringes upon another person&#39;s creations or identity without their explicit consent should be severely punished, as should any attempt to coerce any individual or entity into granting such approval/consent.<br/><br/>It is already abundantly obvious to anyone who has seriously used these currently available AI generation tools that many of them are being used to impersonate or plagiarize, especially artists and their artwork. Regulation must make abundantly clear that using AI or any software like it to impersonate  another person&#39;s creative output, likeness, voice, image, etc. without their permission--especially for profit, but not necessarily exclusively--is a kind of fraud, and it should outline appropriately severe punishments for such use.
