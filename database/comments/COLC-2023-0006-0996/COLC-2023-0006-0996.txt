As a librarian, I find the idea of AI created content to be a horrendous affront to creatives everywhere. To tell authors with books in libraries across the country that AI writing, poor regurgitations, cobbled together from the authors&#39; own works, is acceptable - is highly offensive. If this is acceptable, librarians wil no longer be needed - why not let AI determine what books are appropriate for the masses to read? Ridiculous
