Artificial intelligence should never have more protections than the human beings using it as a tool. Human work and needs have to be prioritized as we look towards the future, not the aggressive growth of something that will ultimately be incredibly damaging to the world. We have the benefit of foresight here and it needs to be applied in practical protections like copyright, AI attributing credit to source materials and notifying users of copyright infringement if work is used improperly. Transparency in who owns searches, and databases, and how that information will be used. <br/><br/>We used to be a country that was agricultural, then we became a country that manufactured things, now we&rsquo;re a company that markets products made in other countries. What jobs will theee re be left if AI takes away more industries. You will have a country in a thick malaise, lacking physical purpose and function.
