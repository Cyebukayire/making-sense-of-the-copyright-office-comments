Comment regarding  (2) the copyrightability of material generated using AI systems. Material that is entirely generated by AI should not be subject to copyright. However, material that is human-generated but assisted by AI should be eligible for copyright. Understandably, the difficulty comes in determining where to draw the line between human-generated content and AI-generated content. For example, AI-generating a simple line drawing that is subsequently shaded/colored and modified by a human artist should be subject to copyright protection. I think the best bright-line rule would be that any work where more than 50% of that work is generated by a human should be eligible for copyright protection. (Understandably, proving which portions of a work were human vs. AI generated may prove quite difficult, but currently anyone can register a piece generated by AI with the copyright office and, unless the work is declared to be A.I., it is impossible to determine with any degree of certainty whether the work was created by a human or an AI.
