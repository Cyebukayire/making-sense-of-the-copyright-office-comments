AI is theft from artists and writers. AI art/writing is made by taking artists&#39; pieces and putting them through an algorithm, with or without their consent. Unless you explicitly tag against the AI using your art, the AI will use your art in its algorithm. Even then, some bots will completely disregard the tag and use your art anyway. Please do something about this. Mine and my friends&#39; art has been stolen because of these nefarious programs.
