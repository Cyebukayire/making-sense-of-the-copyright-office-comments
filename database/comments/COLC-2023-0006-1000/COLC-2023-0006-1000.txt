Products of AI are not original because they pull from original artists, writers, and other creators in a way that imitates them. While there are people typing in prompts for the AI, the person is not creating an original product using their own skills or ideas. There have been numerous accounts of AI art containing watermarks and being linked directly back to specific creators. In this way, AI products are not original, and creators should be protected from having their art, writing, or other creative endeavors protected from being used to train AI. As far as I know, there is an anti-AI protection called glaze, which was developed specifically to protect artists work by working to poison AI learning. While this is helpful in the meantime, there are surely efforts to combat this, so protections for creators should be established sooner rather than later. As far as I know, the only protection for writers is to lock their content from the general internet by only allowing users to see heir work. However, individuals are known to take these works and use AI to &ldquo;finish&rdquo; the ending or otherwise learn from it. Overall, there should be protections for all creators concerning their original work, of which AI produced content is not, so people can continue to create, distribute, sell, and otherwise spread their content across the wider internet without fear that AI will steal their hard work.
