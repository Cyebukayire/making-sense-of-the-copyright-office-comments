I support regulation of AI use of copyrighted material, or material that could reasonably be assumed to be copyrighted.  Probably not forbidding it outright, since that would also affect human-made derivative works, but at minimum publicly listing all copyrighted material used in training datasets and making a good-faith effort (by a human) to determine the copyright holder&#39;s position on use of their work.
