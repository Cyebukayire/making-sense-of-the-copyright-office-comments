Let the content creators decide whether they wish for their creative content to be used by for-profit companies corporations to train their for-profit AI models.  We don&rsquo;t force authors to provide their work for free so that new authors can create derivative written works.  In any other context, this unfettered commercial use of others creative works would be an egregious affront to copywrite law.  Simply due to its massive scale we seem to be treating this differently when it should not be.  Keep in mind that these prompts are meant to provide both derivative output across massive tranches of data or very specific subsets (e.g. write me a poem in the style of Amanda Gorman).  These Large Language Models are not human and we cannot ascribe fair use or comedic use to their outputs.  Let content creators or their authorize content licensees make their own decisions as to whether they want or do not want these AI and LLM companies taking their creative outputs and using them for the current and future end purposes.
