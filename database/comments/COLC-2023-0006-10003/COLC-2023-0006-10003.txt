As an artist that has spent the last 30 years on the internet, meeting and learning from other artists, sharing my work and working on improving my skills, the AI models as they are currently implemented and designed are solely responsible for me no longer feeling safe not only to share my works, but to even use modern tools like Photoshop and others using my techniques to feed into their algorithm to train their AIs. This is the single greatest threat to my profession I see today. Currently there are no safeguards in these systems to prevent my work from being scanned into these models to train their AIs. In turn, those models will be sold to other companies, and not even compensate me for using my work. I also have no indication of when this happens, so my option to refuse participation is wholly taken from me.
