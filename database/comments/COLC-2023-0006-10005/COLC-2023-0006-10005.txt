I believe that all ai content should remain in the public domain and not be allowed to be legally protected. AI image models like Dall-e and stable diffusion are clearly trained on individuals copyrighted artworks without any permission or licensing of the artwork. These tools have the potential to destroy a large percentage of the creative jobs around the world and will mostly affect the livelihoods of serious trained professionals who sell their artworks as part of licensing agreements. Diffusion models are non consensually trained on entire artists portfolios of work can create new works that directly mimic the original artists creative IP effectively breaking our existing copyright laws. This is why I believe none of the work created by AI models, trained on data obtained without permission should be allowed to be protected by copyrights or trademarks.
