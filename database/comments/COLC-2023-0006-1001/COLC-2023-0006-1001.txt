To whom it may concern:<br/><br/>AI does not create anything for itself; it is not a sentient, thinking being. What it creates is a sum.of the things it&#39;s been fed and while that can easily be mistaken for actual intelligence it is not; ai doesn&#39;t create it just generates. <br/>Calling it artificial intelligence is misleading.<br/>I firmly believe that we need better protections for real artists and authors whose work is being scraped and fed to these systems, which then more or less steal their work and allow others to claim they &quot;drew/wrote&quot; it when in fact they&#39;ve done nothing but imput a prompt and accept a generated result.  That is not an act of creation.  That&#39;s like pressing the start button on a blender to make a smoothie. A smoothie is not a fruit or a meal it&#39;s a combo of whatever is put into it. <br/><br/>The point is ai generated/or artificially generated art and writing is a dangerous step that steaks the hard work of actual people and then allows others to claim it as their own without due credit or recompense; further, I&#39;ve seen it ve used in actual journals to write news articles full of inaccurate and outright false information-- thus on top of the generated essays on chat gbt and other such sites that have already gad a hand in spreading misinformation due to the misconception that the ai is actually researching. <br/>It is not. It&#39;s taking previous examples and making up a nonsense citation based on citations it&#39; has been fed in the past. <br/><br/>My point is that artificial intelligence is not a sentient being creating art based on years of practice and work; it is an algorithm that only spews out what it&#39;s been fed. And so far it&#39;s been fed artwork that has been stolen from others. It&#39;s enough to make anybartist wary of sharing their work in any capacity; who will pay us, when someone can just go to some website and scrape our work and get free art that looks like ours instead?<br/><br/>Like damn. At least art thieves who reproduce art by brush have to KNOW what they&#39;re doing to pass off a piece as the work of a master; ai isn&#39;t sentient it just spits out what it&#39;s asked too. <br/><br/>Anyway. Until such a time as computers actually gain sentience on a human level and can thus become artists in their own right,  copyright laws MUST become stronger against the use of ai.  There MUST be better protections for artists whose work has been scraped from the internet and fed to these machines; that counts as plagiarism in my book. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
