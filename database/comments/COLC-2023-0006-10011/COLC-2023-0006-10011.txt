I run a small local news business and publish a neighborhood-specific publication called the McKinley Park News. Despite our Terms of Service explicitly forbidding access and use of our Service for any AI or LLM training, tens of thousands of web pages of our all-original content has been employed in large language model-powered services. This directly undermines our ability to run a local news business and it directly undermines my livelihood as a local journalist because it&#39;s not only stealing our content and Service without remuneration, it&#39;s employing our Service to enable products and services that compete directly against us, such as when a search engine returns an AI-generated answer that relies on our content, but gives us no reference, hyperlink, payment or other benefit. Attached is a PDF file comprising the text of a May 24, 2023, Letter from the Editor titled &quot;Why I&#39;ll Quit Publishing the McKinley Park News.&quot; This details our specific problems with this theft and offers ideas for regulation. Thank you for your consideration. Please follow up with me directly if there is any need to do so. -- Justin Kerr, Publisher, McKinley Park News, justinkerr@mckinleypark.news, 312-560-1115, https://mckinleypark.news
