It is important to respect human made art and protect it from scraping for AI production. Anything created via AI without consent from the human creators should not be allowed copyright protections at all. Protecting AI with no regard to the real people creating the art AI is scraping from, is a horrible world to live in and a violation of human rights. AI has been shown to have racist and ableist tendencies, it shouldn&rsquo;t be protected when it is still very much so not something to be utilized without proper restrictions and rules applied to it. AI should always be clearly labeled as AI, and it is not art if it is not created with human hands.
