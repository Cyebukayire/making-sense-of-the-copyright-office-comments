AI generated imagery has rightfully attracted controversy. It is an anticompetitive practice at best and copyright infringement at worst.<br/><br/>The current system of AI image generation: Devalues human creativity and works of cultural value, misappropriates human labor by oversaturating the market with derivative works that will confuse consumers, and rewards predatory behavior by placing the burden of opting out of AI training data on creators.<br/><br/>However, there are Instances where AI image generators can be helpful: <br/><br/>1) Restoration of archival footage or artworks: This is already a common practice for restoring paintings. This technology could help us preserve and restore works of cultural and historical value. <br/><br/>2) Search engine optimization: Identification and organization of images. AI could be trained to recognize and automatically &quot;tag&quot; existing images, making it easier to search for images or articles online. <br/><br/>3) Art assistant: painting studios back in the Renaissance era produced artwork by a number of apprentices who were trained in the master&#39;s style. Aging or infirmed artists may be able to continue producing work if the AI is trained on their existing work. 4) Copyright Protection: Using something like block chain, an AI could automatically issue DMCA takedown notices for misappropriated copyright material.<br/><br/>Several Influential people in the tech sphere claim that AI usage is our only safeguard from obsolescence, when in fact its current unbridled use will only make obsolescence a certainty. Innovations in AI should prioritize increasing human value, not supplanting it.
