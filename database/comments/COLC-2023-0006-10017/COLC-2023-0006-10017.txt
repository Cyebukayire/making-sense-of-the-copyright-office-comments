AI using human creation of any sort should be prohibited unless explicit permission is given by the human creator in return for royalties for at least 150 years, and credit given to the human creator. Other than this it is stealing without repercussion; it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the whole or parts of human creation works are used by the AI systems. Some may argue that data is needed to train AI systems, for those people the answer is pay to the human creators and get permission then use the work, other than that companies trying to train the AI systems are stealing other people&rsquo;s work. AI using human creation works must be stopped.
