An AI &quot;artist&quot; does not meaningfully produce any new work. There is an argument that a person using a computer to generate art is like a person commissioning an artist to generate art, and in both cases the prompter/commissioner should hold copyright. In the case of the commission, the artist, by virtue of creating the art, holds the original rights to the image; it is only because the artist has made an arrangement with their employer that the employer can hold any rights to the images. It has been ruled in previous cases (Naruto v. Slater, No. 16-15469 (9th Cir. 2018)) that only people can create copyrightable works. If a monkey acting as a photographer can&#39;t hold copyright, I see no reason why a computer could hold copyright and transfer that to a human the way an artist can transfer copyright to the employer - especially if the program is public and no additional data is being provided to the computer. <br/>To the points:<br/>1. The risks significantly outweigh the benefits. As a professional artist, I am worried I could be out of a job if my employers decide that our customers don&#39;t need art so much as they just need shiny blobs to look at. As a copyright holder of art I have produced, I am a. worried that these models have violated my specific copyright and b. know with full certainty that these models have violated copyright generally in using art in a way the copyright holders (often living artists) did not consent to. As someone who intends to go into some form of technology development (current university Computer Science student), I can see AI being used to devalue my work (eg. chatGPT writing code and science becoming seen as a more and more useless field). As a researcher - people are driven to research because they genuinely care. Automation takes the care out of it. And finally, as a member of the public - when I go to art museums, I am asked to consider the life of the artist and how we are connected. Everything can be like that - it is not automatic, but I can eat bread and think of the baker, look at this website and consider the HTML, CSS, and other components that make this site functional and easy to use and ask myself how the web designer made these choices. I could quite literally watch paint dry and think of the designer who came up with that specific shade, and study how it interacts with the wall and the lighting around it - the wall and lighting each offering their own questions about their makers. I&#39;ll freely admit that I would much rather not watch paint dry, but in everything there is an ability to connect with people and envision new ways of seeing the world. As we as a society have become more globalized, we have partially lost the ability to connect with the people who directly support our lives. I no longer trade eggs with my neighbor for bread, I go to the store and the baker may be thousands of miles away. But nonetheless, I can think about the person on the other end. By allowing something automated to infiltrate our lives, we break out human connection entirely. We live in a society that supposes we are all our own islands, and then wonder why we become increasingly isolated and depressed. There is nothing good that can come of the public when we make each man his own island, especially with regards to art - which ought to be the most human of all labor.<br/>2. Yes; as I am currently a professional artist.<br/>3. I mentioned a court case in my opening blurb (I&#39;m terribly sorry about the stream of conscious writing) https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/16-15469/16-15469-2018-04-23.html<br/>4. I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m not too familiar with other countries&#39; laws. But consistency is absolutely required - it is notoriously hard to prosecute online schemes, and if it&#39;s legal to sell AI generated images for profit as long as you can your server is in another country, it isn&#39;t hard to practically sell AI art wherever.<br/>5. Absolutely. Image (as well as text, music, and any other mediums, but as a visual artist I will focus on the visual) generation, if it does exist, must be trained according to an opt-in system. These data sets must be publicly assessable so that any artist can guarantee that their art is not being used without consent. No entity should be allowed to use the &quot;it&#39;s already trained, so it doesn&#39;t matter anymore&quot; argument - if an entity is found to be using images in training data without consent, they must be forced to pay the artist and entirely scrap the model - even if the entity is non-profit and even if an entity has sold licenses to a model and would thus be hugely set back by scraping it.<br/>I have fewer than 400 characters, so to speedrun:<br/>6. For visual art, I think DeviantArt has. I uploaded art there before anyone knew what AI art was.<br/>8. None, except strict academic research.<br/>9. Opt-in; I shouldn&#39;t be forced to opt-out of copyright violation with a default of yes, just as I shouldn&#39;t be forced to out-opt of a bodily violation.<br/>10. Similar to other licensing.
