I just wanted to remind everyone that a book is not the words on the page. I&#39;m about to resubmit the seventh draft of a novel I wrote to an agent-- it&#39;s 2023, and I started this in 2016. This book involves traveling to two states, waking up hours early every morning before work, many long walks, paying a writing instructor for feedback-- and many friends spending their hours reading and commenting on drafts. It&#39;s been seven years of my life, before the book has even been accepted by an agent. And that&#39;s just this one--not the four I wrote before this, the hours practicing my craft, the mountains of self-addressed stamped envelopes I sent out before the internet existed. These are not words on a page--they are real human effort and the investment of a lifetime, squeezed in around family, jobs, friends and getting the grass mowed. Because what writing truly gives us is the ability to sit --miles or centuries away from another human-- and absorb their thoughts and feelings. To understand another person. To permit a network to suck up the words and spit them out in a different arrangement is dishonoring to all of our humanity--both the writer&#39;s and the reader&#39;s.
