This is against our constitutional right to choose how our gifts are distributed. this process is irresponsible and unjust to human creators who have worked hard to navigate obstacles to earn sustainability for their lifestyles. It&#39;s not okay to profit from another entity&#39;s product/service without proper agreement terms between who provided what is being replicated through technology. this process will ultimately devalue products/services people work hard and invest to acquire. this must stop and will not prevail without agreeable monetization terms only. AI should have to pay to play.
