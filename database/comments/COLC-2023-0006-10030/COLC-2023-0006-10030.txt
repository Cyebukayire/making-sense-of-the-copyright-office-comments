In my honest opinion, as a writer and content creator, I do not feel that AI should be allowed to make money or profit anyway off of my intellectual property or creativity without my consent or without rewarding me financially. I think that AI is the dummying down of our country and of the world. People will become more and more robotic and less and less creative. It breeds laziness and theft. And does not promote intelligence or intellect. I&#39;m afraid of what it is doing and it saddens me to witness the intellectual decay of our Nation.
