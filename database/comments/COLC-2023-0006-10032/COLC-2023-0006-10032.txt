I Ash Exantus believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) SHOULD NOT be allowed to copy and make money using people&#39;s voices and pictures without their permission. The truth is that many creators work hard to create their intellectual property and their experiences and work should ONLY be monetized by them or they should have the right to give permission in order for someone to benefit.
