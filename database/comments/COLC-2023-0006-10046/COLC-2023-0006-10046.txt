Here is my view: if an AI system is transformative enough and thus not a product of the millions of people whose work was harvested without compensation, to the point that there is no need for those people to receive compensation or ownership of the system, then it must certainly also be true that the same AI system is not a product of the company or people who worked other aspects of it either, to the point that there is no need for those people to receive compensation or ownership of the system either.<br/><br/>On this basis, I would argue that any computer system that relies upon such uncompensated work to any meaningful degree, should be considered innately public domain and therefore not be subjected to any copyright restrictions or intellectual property of any kind and in any of its parts.<br/><br/>If a product relies upon the unconstrained processing of the common artistic heritage of mankind with no regard for its private property, it only seems logical that such a product would itself constitute a common and unconstrained heritage of mankind with no regard for private property.<br/><br/>Of course, for those entities that wish to maintain private ownership of their systems, this should still be possible, but only if all the parties in the creation of the system, including all data sources, taggers, developers and everyone else, are duly and contractually compensated.<br/><br/>Either everyone gets compensated, or nobody does. Anything less will only ever be unfair to at least one of parties involved.
