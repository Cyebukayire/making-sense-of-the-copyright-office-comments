Please develop and enforce laws regarding AI and protection for creators. While I&#39;m excited for the potential of AI as a tool, it is currently being used in very unethical ways, especially against artists who already have a persona of being poor and scraping by. As an artist myself, ever since the introduction of Midjourney and other AI that scrapes art data, I have been afraid of uploading my works online for others to see. This not only hinders the growth of individual artists, but of the culture that stems from art. Artists beg for people to not feed their art into AI, to stop imitating their art for profit without compensation or consent. They are ignored by people and corporations alike. Please protect us.
