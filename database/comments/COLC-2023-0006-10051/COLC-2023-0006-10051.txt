AI should only use data that has explicit consent to use to help it. It has used copyrighted and non copyrighted material that people have worked to create.<br/><br/>AI generated material shouldn&rsquo;t be copyrighted without human involvement. It is a system that uses other people to make a whole piece. It is inherently unoriginal.<br/><br/>As a whole, a lot of people are against AI replacing artists and writers. Thousands of people were outraged to find that something they created for fun, as a hobby, was used without their consent to train AI. It&rsquo;s like using someone&rsquo;s sewn teddy-bear to train a dog without their consent. That teddy-bear was a labor of love, meant to be shared with others with a similar appreciation, not given to a dog for it to potentially ruin. Even if it came back fine, one can&rsquo;t look at it the same way knowing it was used without your knowledge, without your permission. <br/>
