AI for ART and Writing are no more and no less than hiring an assistant or a ghost writer or a buying a book and using a copy machine.  Training on AI should have less restrictions on the calls (example:  I want to write in a strong and vivid action voice like my favorite author), but an OPT Out by artists and authors in a centralized database, that is updated and pinged regularly.  There should also be some minor but broad compensation formula to owners of works when used by an AI for training initially, some kind of formula slightly more than buying the book.  However, these AI should also be able to come up with a system for additional payment based on calls, pings, and reference measurements against a work, and that be put into place.  This shouldn&#39;t be a fleece the new tech movement or fatten scared or greedy authors/artists.
