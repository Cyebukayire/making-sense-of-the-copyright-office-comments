Any new copyright limitations on AI should be narrow and targeted, and work to benefit society as a whole, rather than only benefitting professional artists. For example, it might be appropriate to legislate against allowing users to use the name of a single living artist in a prompt to generate material in that artist&#39;s style. But naming multiple artists to generate a new style that is influenced by all those names, or training the model on images that anyone can view on the net, should be fair game. Open image generation software greatly expands the set of people who can render their imaginations into a fixed medium. We shouldn&#39;t limit that except where the harms are the most direct and egregious.
