Economic reasoning supporting immediate, urgency for adding opt out feature to copyright e-co registration system.<br/><br/>Opt Out Feature Explained<br/>First, US Copyright Office please add the sole author opt-out feature immediately to e-co registration system. <br/><br/>Second, have the public record of each new sole-author registration display in text something like: Register of this work (registration number) reserves the right to opt-out of allowing this work to be used in any machine learning model or other compute model training technology without written, contractual author agreed upon consent in the form of a postal mailed contractual agreement.<br/><br/>Urgency<br/>US Copyright Office, needs to treat machine learning (foundation) model training as a current burning barn, burning house emergency situation capable of reducing author and publishing company income&mdash; and needing immediate solution. US Copyright Office can do so (immediately) by championing, promoting to US Representatives a &lsquo;opt out&rsquo; feature, simple check box in the registration workflow, added in e-co registration system for all sole authors registering new works.<br/><br/>Economic Reasoning<br/>November 2023 OpenAI announced GPT-4 Turbo with a token usage pricing cost of: 1 cent per 1,000 input tokens<br/>3 cents per 1,000 output tokens<br/>128,000 tokens roughly equals 300 pages of content<br/><br/>therefore<br/>input cost of 300 pages $1,280 output cost of 300 pages $3,840<br/>Total cost to input and output a 300 page written book in GPT-4 Turbo $5,120<br/><br/>Essentially it costs $5,000 to accidentally or purposely destroy the entire market space for a sole author&rsquo;s new or existing work. At that price GPT-4 Turbo can be exposed to the entire arc of story, narrative, characters, patterns, story style, author and best practices of a unpublished and published work. How can Foundation models converse about characters and arc of story of Harry Potter, if not trained on synopsis&rsquo; of the storyline or the actual work? Foundation models will never be able to converse about arc of story of a work not yet written and hopefully, works not yet published.<br/>GPT-4 Turbo presents a immediate (potential) economic problem for writer&rsquo;s&mdash; real people who need to buy food to put in their refrigerators to feed their children, pay their rent...<br/><br/>Book Author. Average first time authors who submit their first time book to a publisher, (usually) get no income in advance for their new work (unless already a topical expert or famous).<br/><br/>A somewhat successful author on a 2nd or third book might receive a small advance and final draft pay to author a new book. In today&rsquo;s professional writer marketplace and income declining market, even less royalties in 2023 per unit streamed and per unit sold.<br/><br/>Theatrical Writer Income<br/>Screenplay, Movie, Theatrical. Writer&rsquo;s Guild West explains on their website under Contracts, the Minimum Basic <br/><br/>Agreement www.wga.org/contracts/contracts/mba<br/>A theatrical writer&rsquo;s Term Contract or Deal Contract generates a first draft (treatment) income for a writer. Independent movie script writers, not much advance income at all and barely a living wage. Feature films, fully capitalized&mdash; may generate a short term living wage for a screen writer. <br/><br/>Television writers on a term or week-to-week contract may generate a part of year living wage. Book, theatrical and television on average are generating less income for writer&rsquo;s than in previous years.<br/><br/>All Sole-Author Emergency<br/>Now is a economic income emergency for writer&rsquo;s, authors, musicians, artists and software developers. US Copyright Office ends to with urgency design, develop, test and deploy the sole- author registration &lsquo;opt out&rsquo; feature enabling the sole-author right to NOT allow their registered works used in machine learning model training and development. Essentially, now, today, not some future AI day, it costs $5,000 to upload and output a book or screenplays that may have taken years of work to write, edit, revise through numerous drafts at wages that would normally have totaled $50,000-$250,000. For $5,000 cost&mdash; a foundation model like GPT-Turbo can (essentially) describe, &lsquo;regurgitate&rsquo; a arc of story, character names, subplots, and pontificate on what if&mdash; of a new work that is yet to be published, unpublished or is currently published.<br/><br/>Addressing Copyright Infringement<br/>In November 2023, OpenAI announced Copyright Shield, where customers who use their API may have infringement suits paid for by OpenAI. However, sole authors will only be able to recoup $30,000 (at most) through the Copyright Claims Board. Unless a author brings a expensive Federal case to court. Essentially, the market is now structured as the author&rsquo;s duty to use GPT-4 Turbo to find out if the Foundation model and application can &lsquo;discuss&rsquo;, describe, regurgitate arc of story and characters which a sole author wrote and owns copyright.<br/><br/>Please add &lsquo;opt out&rsquo; feature to US Copyright registration system, e-co, workflow today.
