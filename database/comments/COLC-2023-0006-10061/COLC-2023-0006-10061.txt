I am very much against the usage of AI in things such as art, voice acting, writing, actor replication, and etc. It is an extremely disgusting process to me, as it takes from artists of all kinds and can even take their likenesses without their consent. The people who attempt to advocate for it, calling it &ldquo;the future&rdquo;, are absolute liars. They wish to push it out of greed and refusing to pay artists, or sometimes just wanting to spite them just for their own sick amusement. <br/><br/>Many artists have already lost jobs and opportunities thanks to this practice of pushing AI, and that is quite frankly sickening to me. I don&rsquo;t think of myself as a creative, but several of my friends are creatives, and seeing something like this happen is quite frankly rage inducing. Please consider this as you approach the topic of AI.
