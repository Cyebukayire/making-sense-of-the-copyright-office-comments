Super simple in my mind. AI should not be able to be copyrighted. It was built on the backs of every creator sharing their works into the world and to now allow companies to use those freely shared works as a profit center to generate new content goes against the whole fabric of society. There is a ton of money in taking other people&#39;s works, remixing it and then selling it for profit. And that is going to be very profitable. It is generating stuff on the backs of those who will never get paid nor recognition for their work.
