As a human being, I am entitled to retain the rights to my own image and likeness, including my voice.<br/>The voiceover and voice acting community finds the idea of unregulated or even sub regulated artificial intelligence to be absolutely terrifying. My livelihood is dependent on the use of my voice and it&#39;s various vocal unique traits, and not only does my child depend on this, my Humanity thrives on this. I bring characters to life with the use of my voice, and if that was stolen from me by a program and some person deciding that they now have control over me, who am I anymore as an individual?<br/><br/>Most companies are greedy, so let&#39;s get that right out in the open; they will utilize AI only to their benefit themselves, to the detriment of others. If artificial intelligence is not regulated heavily in favor of the individual, then this is essentially saying that corporations can pay an algorithm to steal my likeness and sell it as if they had paid me, but they&#39;re not paying me, so they will be stealing from me and right out of the mouth of my child.<br/><br/>I urge you to look at this not from a creative individual standpoint, but as if this was you, and you are simply just a human being, are you not? Would you want someone to steal your voice and likeness, and call your banking institution with your information and have your accounts taken over? This can be done if artificial intelligence is not regulated in favor of the individual, and not the corporations or those creating these tools. Yes artificial intelligence can be used to help and benefit the many, but only if it&#39;s used for those reasons alone. We need heavy regulations in favor of the individuals, the creatives, and the humans involved that they are deriving the works from.
