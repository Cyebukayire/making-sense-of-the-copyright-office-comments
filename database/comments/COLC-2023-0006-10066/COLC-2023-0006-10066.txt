AI has its place, but it&#39;s not everywhere all at once.  It ought not to take anything away from artists, for instance.  We don&#39;t need to replace people, it&#39;s not here to save us from ourselves.  If a person wants to make something with AI, okay, but don&#39;t take money away from artists to do it.  Don&#39;t use the likeness of a real person, living or dead, that&#39;s not its purpose.    People want to make a living being creative and that&#39;s already difficult to do, adding AI into the mix is unnecessary, harmful, greedy, toxic, and in short, evil.
