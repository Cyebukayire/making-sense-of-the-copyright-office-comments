It is undeniable these Ai tools steal artists&rsquo; work without consent to push these hardworking people out of jobs. Not only have major companies in Ai already confirmed that countless images have been used without consent, it is simply undeniable based on the way the software works. Between fake watermarks, perfectly recreated copyright material, and being able to recreate specific artists&rsquo; styles by typing their names in a prompt, it is clear the theft that these tools have performed is to an unprecedented degree. Billionaires are making even more while actively stealing artists work and putting them out of jobs. This is completely unfair and needs to be rectified immediately. This is not like any other tool created in the past, as it fundamentally requires the use of stolen work taken without consent.<br/><br/>Ai tools need to be rebuilt from the ground up to ensure work isn&rsquo;t stolen without consent. If these tools are not profitable without stealing work, then they should not exist. <br/><br/>Additionally, it is completely factitious to argue these tools simply learn like humans. Beyond the fact that removing these datasets of stolen work would prevent the tools from working (showing it is not &ldquo;learning&rdquo; to begin with), the way Ai creates images does not in any way reflect the way the human mind works. These programs have been trained on countless images and release thousands upon thousands of images a day, yet the mistakes the tools make are fundamentally not human. When an AI draws a human (without an easy source from a stolen dataset), it creates abominations that look nothing like humans, despite having countless datasets of humans and producing thousands of &ldquo;works&rdquo; involving humans. If an Ai truly learned like a human, it would not still be creating these inhuman abominations. It is not learning; it is stealing, and when something can&rsquo;t be stolen, it creates nonsense.<br/><br/>Please, if you want the Copyright system to product people creating unique work and punish those for stealing said work, the current model of generative Ai cannot exist the way it does today. Every day this model is allowed to exist allows for more work to be stolen and for the Copyright system that has allowed our country to thrive will fall apart. Something must be done before it is too late
