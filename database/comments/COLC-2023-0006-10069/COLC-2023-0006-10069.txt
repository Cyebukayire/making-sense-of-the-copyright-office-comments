As a professional artist and student of arts-based public education, let me just say that AI using copy written works to train their datasets, without compensating the rights holders, is an egregious and arrogant stance, not just from a legal perspective, but a moral one. It is not &quot;fair use&quot; to take someone&#39;s copy written work and &quot;transform&quot; it, as the claim is made. The law clearly states that transformative use of copyrights are reserved for non-profit entities, which none of the major AI platforms are. They may not be profitable now, but they are well funded, so the argument is moot. Also, there&#39;s something soulless about taking culture and cramming it into 1s and 0s and claiming that everyone will be empowered to be artists. There is a reason that not everyone becomes an artist; it&#39;s a new way to judge and scrutinize yourself, but this is important work in building craft and style. AI art tools that contain copy written works, will rob every would-be artist from experiencing the stops and starts of learning how to become themselves, while robbing all the artists whose work is contained within the dataset. WHY DID COPYRIGHTS EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE? Copyright was created to protect creators of IP from theft and misuse, and so, if AI is already sneaking around this protective firewall, then the real issue isn&#39;t if AI should or should not be able to train on copy written work, but how much they should be paying for the luxury of their theft? If any normal person out there trained a program to spit out songs in the style of Michael Jackson, or art is the style of Kadinsky, or a script for a movie that is basically Star Wars, that person would be shut down, or asked to cough up major liscensing fees, which is good and proper. But if a huge AI company does it, we switch the rules? Because we don&#39;t want to stifle tech innovation? What if offering all the worlds copy written culture into a machine stifles HUMAN innovation and drive? Human-generated art has been creating and consolidating cultures for millennia, and if AI wants to take the mantle then that&#39;s fine, just pay the appropriate amount for access to all of this IP. If they can&#39;t pay, then they can&#39;t pay, but they&#39;ll be hitting their heads on a ceiling that has existed for decades for everyone. It would be a shame to remove that ceiling just so AI companies can steal/appropriate/bastardize the hard work of hundreds of thousands of real people into a soulless machine that farts out shit it can&#39;t understand in the first place.
