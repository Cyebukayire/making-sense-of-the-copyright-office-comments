AI is an amazing tool that allows artists to explore new ideas quickly and easily. AI is a continuously developing technology, and the ways in which the human artist can manipulate the images through AI continue to evolve. With Midjourney  I can create a novel image with prompting, create multiple variations of that image that utilize the same algorithms that created the first, and then select portions of that image to prompt in new ways. I can change the matte, zoom, and even pan in different directions, changing the text prompt with each alteration. The human artist has a ton of control with the output at this point, and that&#39;s only growing. I hope you&#39;ll look towards the future and see the positive opportunities offered by this technology for human creatives to generate amazing imagery that should be protected for human creatives to generate amazing, novel imagery with this advanced artists tool, and that should be protected. Thank you!<br/><br/>* I would love to have provided process images but image attachment was not working when I filled this form out.
