Background: I am a visual artist, who has been drawing for upwards of 7 years. I am attending art school full time and a pursuing art professionally.<br/><br/>Question 1: Generative AI holds huge risks for me and other visual artists. Our work is taken and used without permission to train AI that creates inferior work, not only technically, but emotionally, as these AI are incapable of passion or inspiration. They do not truly create, they only take. Already, I have heard of major employers in the entertainment industry laying off or reducing artist roles in favor of AI. This is a direct threat to my, and millions of others, livelihoods. The increased use of AI is only beneficial to multi-billion dollar companies who are profiting off the uncredited and unpaid labor of individual artists. According to Technet, AI will &ldquo;democratize&rdquo; creativity. However, creativity is a core part of the human experience. Almost anyone could learn to draw and become an artist. All it takes is paper and a pencil, and there are many free resources. Creativity and art are already democratized because they are part of being human. I have spent hundreds of hours learning, both on my own and at college, to get where I am today. The idea that my life&rsquo;s work could be fed into a machine and used in my stead is devastating.  <br/><br/>Question 9: Being able to opt-out is not enough; being given the choice to opt in is necessary. Currently, companies often hide opt-outs and deliberately make them difficult to access. Prior knowledge of what to look for and where are necessary for many of these opt outs. For example, on popular art sharing site ArtStation, each image must be posted with the hashtag &ldquo;noai&rdquo; to opt that singular image out of AI model set training. This is obscure and time consuming, and easy for creators to forget about when making a new post. Only requiring opt-outs prohibits people from being able to protect themselves and their work.<br/><br/>Question 9.5: As a comic artist, I work in a sector where made for hire work is common. Absolutely, people who create made-for-hire work should be able to object to their work being used to train AI. If I was hired to draw for a Spider-man comic, and could not object, someone could use AI to create a piece that looks like it came from the comic I worked on, replicating my style, and potentially spread misinformation about me or the work, or use it to wholesale copy and imitate my work, and even make a profit on it (for example, creating an AI-generated lookalike comic for a fan publication). This would damage my reputation and hurt me financially, so even on a work-for-hire basis, creatives should be able to object. <br/><br/>Question 28: Copyright law should absolutely require that AI generated work be identified publicly. It could potentially be used to impersonate others or spread disinformation. Anyone could generate a &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; of a public figure committing a crime, for example, which could then be passed off as genuine and irreparably harm their reputation. <br/>
