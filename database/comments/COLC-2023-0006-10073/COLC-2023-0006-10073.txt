AI is stealing plain and simple all these generative AI were trained without artists consent or compensation in order to feed the machine , and it&rsquo;s not only artists but performers as well. All of peoples skills and talents were feed into these machines without consent and compensation. It&rsquo;s not the same as someone get inspired by and creating something new these straight up copy and spit out copies because it can&rsquo;t do anything new it can only steal. The artists and performers should have been given compensation and their consent asked beforehand. There should be laws against this and the data sets as they stand should be destroyed. I firmly believe there needs to new copyright laws to protect artists as well as peoples likeness from getting feed into a machine without getting consent and compensation. It&rsquo;s theft plain and simple.
