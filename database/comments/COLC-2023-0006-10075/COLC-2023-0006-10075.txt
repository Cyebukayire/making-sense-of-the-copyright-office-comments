AI art should be treated as human art because that is basically what it is, the human gives the prompt and the AI draws<br/>it, when someone makes a pictures of mickey mouse they should be subject to copyright law. Non-AI artist&#39;s work will be<br/>more special as it&#39;s hand made and distinguished by AI art.
