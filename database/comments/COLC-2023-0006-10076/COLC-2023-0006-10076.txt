I oppose the creation of regulations in regards to the aforementioned tools on these grounds:<br/>1-The US Copyright Office cannot adequately meet all of its responsibilities under its current workload; adding an unknowable number of additional cases that require further technical expertise related to these software that regulators are unlikely to be Subject Matter Experts on is fundamentally untenable at the current time.<br/>2-The technology is still immature and restricted largely to corporate enterprises who, though they may make their capabilities available to the public at large as various services, are principally different in terms of their motivation and usage than the average individual enthusiast user. Until such a time as these content generation algorithms are able to create photo-realistic work (specifically video as this contains mediums of both sight and sound) of &quot;fidelity&quot; such that a reasonable person is unable to tell the difference between the generation and a high-quality recording using only the most common hardware available (which, barring any significant advancements in computing would be a smartphone) seeking to regulate is premature.<br/>3-These technologies are already global. Preventing American Citizens from learning their capabilities, learning telltale signs of use and developing expertise will create a knowledge gap our adversaries will exploit effortlessly. Many countries we currently sanction already have established infrastructure they use for cryptocurrency generation which could be (and likely is already being) turned to the purpose generating assets for economic gain and influence expansion. What they cannot abide is a situation where every person in their country is able to express their dissatisfaction with the local regime in an efficacious and attractive manner. Regulating now would lower us to their level where they would beat us with experience, America would fall behind.<br/>4-The creation of policy should be done in as even-handed a manner as possible and the looming election year presents too much opportunity for legislators to push policy for its politically expedient benefits to their party without considering the long-term consequences of their actions. Good policy is generally boring, the unprecedented looming political environment almost ensures that any legislation established now and at least until the end of next year will not be written by level heads.<br/><br/>The only actionable standards I can see at this time are ones that prevent the creators of algorithms from placing &quot;blocks&quot; in their products that prevent users from generating specific types of content. It would be akin to the People&#39;s Republic of China releasing a free word processor that did not allow a user to type &quot;Great Chinese Famine&quot;. Such restrictions on freedom of expression are especially galling coming from corporations that enjoy substantial government subsidies from our nation which enshrines the Right to Free Speech in the foundational law of the land.
