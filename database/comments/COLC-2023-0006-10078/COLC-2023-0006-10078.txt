In Google&#39;s comment on the benefits of AI, they claim &quot;The fact that a use &#39;enables [a user of an AI tool] to enter the market for works of the same type as the copied work,&#39; i.e., by using the tool to create new visual works that compete in that market, is not the kind of market harm that is relevant to fair use. If it were otherwise, copyright would become a tool for suppressing rather than incentivizing the creation of new works.&quot;<br/><br/>In this comment they clearly state that they believe that this competition will cause market harm, but that they should be allowed to do whatever they want anyway. They think that the creation of these derivative works is more important than protecting the market viability of the work on which their AI is trained.<br/><br/>Speaking as a professional illustrator who has used social media, I have no doubt that my work has been harvested by AI. Among illustrators, having an identifiable personal style is one of the most important parts of our professional identity. I signed up for various social media accounts for professional promotion, many of them more than a decade ago, that have since rewritten their EULAs to sell user work as training data, so my data was harvested without my ability to oppose its use. The threat of my work being harvested for AI training aimed to professionally replace me literally and specifically disincentives me from creating new works and sharing them.<br/><br/>Artists like me rely on copyright to provide us and our works with broad protection. Colossal companies like Google are not the voice that should be trusted in arguments where they are the ones who stand to gain.
