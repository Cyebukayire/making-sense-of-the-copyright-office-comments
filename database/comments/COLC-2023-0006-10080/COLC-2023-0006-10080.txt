The right thing to do is to force these AI companies to delete their models containing the stolen data. They have stolen the works of countless creators without consent or compensation and are directly using the stolen work to compete against them. It&#39;s extremely unethical and unfair to be made to compete against your own stolen labor. Please do not buy the hogwash these big tech companies are selling; software aren&#39;t human beings and they shouldn&#39;t get rights like human beings - the law is to protect people not machines. Please do the right thing. Thank you.
