It&#39;s inevitable that AI-generated material will make its way into registered works. It&#39;s important that any AI-generated content be identified as such in the application. On forms to register works of the performing arts (PA) for example, the applicant is asked if the work contains any derivative works, along with a field to identify those which parts of the work are not original. Forms should be revised to include the question, &quot;Does the work contain any material generated by AI,&quot; along with a field in which the applicant enters a description. In the event that a work, in its entirety, was generated by AI, it is questionable whether a copyright should be registered at all, unless it can be clearly shown that human input to the process was unique and worthy of copyright protection. Works that can be created online with a few keystrokes by anyone with Internet access should not be protected.
