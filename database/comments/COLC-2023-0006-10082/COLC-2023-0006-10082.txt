I stand against AI being used profit as it directly conflicts with the law of all created work becoming copyrighted by their creator(s). TechNet has said that AI makes art &ldquo;beginner friendly&rdquo; while that simply makes it effectively a crutch for those that don&rsquo;t wish to learn and enjoy the process of making art. There&rsquo;s a world of difference between being inspired by an artist and learning off of them compared to taking their work without consent and feeding it into a machine to attempt replicating their art. <br/>Another argument from TechNet is that they can&rsquo;t be held reliable if their systems just happen to be given art for AI studying against the will of artists, which again, still violates copyright laws and is an anti-artist mindset. Creatives shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about their work being stolen by companies wealthier than themselves so those companies can let a machine generate work for them. This actively hinders the possibility of jobs for artists.
