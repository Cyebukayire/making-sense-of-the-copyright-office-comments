As a newer voice actor, it is extremely discouraging to try an break into this industry with the existence of AI. Whether it is from the difficulty in navigating the industry due to the fear of having my voice stolen without my consent, to getting conned from exploitive companies due to my lack of knowledge, or from fear of the market drying up for newer voice actors like myself due to creators opting to go with an AI generated voice instead of hiring an actual actor. Coming in at the tail end of what was considered &quot;the boom of the voice acting industry&quot; to the beginning of an era that seems to be defined by the threat of AI is both interesting, yet depressing. I&#39;ve already invested too much time and effort into this craft, and I don&#39;t want it to be too late.
