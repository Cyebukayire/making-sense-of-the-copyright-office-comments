AI is not &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; the way that science fiction depicts it. It is a generative tool, that much like a search engine, grabs existing information from around the internet and feeds it into a result. Many artists including myself across professional illustrators, film makers, musicians, actors, hobbyists, and the like are having our art scraped and fed into these generative AI programs without our consent or compensation to the original creator who did the real work. It&#39;s theft, exploitative, and it needs heavy regulation to protect real people creators.
