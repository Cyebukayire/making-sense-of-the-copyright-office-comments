Generative AI is not human and therefore, cannot make copyrighted works. However, AI can be a tool of human beings to use as to create copyrighted images. I argue this because most generative AI has a reroll button. The reroll button allows users to see the image the AI spits out to the prompt and tell to it to take another attempt at creating the users idea of the image. It should be added that simply the users prompt should lead to a finding in the human control of the AI as their tool. Humans can give exceptionally specific prompts to the AI which has huge implications on the results. Lastly, I think that AI being viewed as this tool will help enforce a drive towards a future of such great assistive technology. Right now there is such fear surrounding AI that the capability of society benefiting form it to the full extent is limited.
