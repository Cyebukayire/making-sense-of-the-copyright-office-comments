The function of Copyright is to give creators a way to recover the cost of creating while generating works to add to the Public Domain. The allowance of AI-generated IP will do the opposite &mdash; turn the Public Domain into a wasteland of Artificial Ourobouros, where humans cannot afford to create, and only AI trained on an expanding canon of AI art will be profitable for businesses that have no interest in producing culture for the Public Domain at all.<br/><br/>If we are going to value the generation of culture more than we value feeding an extractable resource to IP factories that will then withhold our own culture from us, we must, above all, prioritize both human creators and the Public Domain.
