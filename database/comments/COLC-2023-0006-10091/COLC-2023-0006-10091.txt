Hello, my name is David, and I am writing respectfully to you regarding the comments on &quot;Artificial Intelligence and Copyright&quot;.<br/><br/>I am not an expert in copyright, so my comment is not going to be competently argumented from the position of the current copyright law, but i still want to raise my voice against current GAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) models (Like ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, NovelAI, Adobe Firefly, etc.) and in support of people suffered and still suffering from unfair, unethical and unlawful development and distribution of current popular GAI models.<br/><br/>In my view, as of an average human, the unethical and unfair side of the current GAI models is the lack of respect of their creators to copyright and privacy laws as the result of the training material they put in those models/systems without any consent of the creators or current copyright holders of the images, text, etc. On top of that, models and the products of those models were later monetized, making those compete with the different creative workers in the same field as well as accidentally or purposefully spreading deepfakes (photorealistic images of real or fake people and/or real or fake environments doing/showing things that never happened. The brightest examples are &quot;AI-Generated Deepfake Porn Scandal Rocks New Jersey High School&quot; and &quot;Adobe Is Selling AI-Generated Images of Violence in Gaza and Israel&quot;).<br/><br/>I would like to call for whatever is in your powers to prevent this from happening any further.<br/><br/>Thank you for allowing us to express our voices. Best regards.
