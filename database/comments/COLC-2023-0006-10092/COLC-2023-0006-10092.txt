Being able to generate convincing images, voices, and videos can have catastrophic effects if used maliciously. For example, a student at Westfield High School generated pornographic images of his classmates by looking them up online (https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/students-at-nj-school-reportedly-used-ai-to-make-pornographic-images-of-classmates/4829307/). Sharing and creating images such as this could cause people to lose jobs, scholarships, and cause many adverse impacts on their life. Aditonally, since he was able to generate images of his underage classmates, child pornography can and is being generated. Although generated images won&#39;t directly cause physical harm on a real life child, people who work to rescue children from sexual abuse situations could waste valuable time chasing down a fictional child. Not only that, but one could warp any image of a child into sexual content and use it for any means the creator desires. (Article highlighting concerns about the creation of child porn https://fox59.com/news/national-world/ap-us-news/ap-ai-generated-child-sexual-abuse-images-could-flood-the-internet-a-watchdog-is-calling-for-action/). As stated in the article provided, malicious image generations could target sexual abuse victims that already have content made of them by creating more of said content. Not only is that morally abhorrent, but recreation and continuation of this content will continue the abuse victims have suffered. This can also lead to a victim becoming potentially targeted again. <br/><br/>Another concern is image generation for art. Image generation is already taking artists jobs, a career that already lacks job stability. With companies able to mass produce images, artists will have to work longer and faster to be able to compete. Artists already suffer with the strain of deadlines, crunch culture, inadequate pay, and rejection of personal projects. In fact, conditions such as these give artists a 270% higher rate of suicide than nonartists (source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9014267/). Competitions between other people might be stressful, but at least it&#39;s doable. But competing against a robot that can quickly generate high quality artwork for free is feasibly impossible without exerting oneself. (Article about ai art and how itll impact the artist industry and its workers: https://www.artisana.ai/articles/chinas-video-game-ai-art-crisis-40x-productivity-spike-70-job-loss). This isn&#39;t to say that usage of AI for art should be banned, for AI has already been used to help digital artists in the process of creating long before AI image generation was relevant. For example, Adobe Animate utilizes AI by automatically lipsyncing animation with a tool called &quot;Auto Lip Sync&quot;.How this process works is that a creator draws various mouth shape assets (ex. An open mouth for talking), convert those mouth assets into a graphic, hook the individual graphics to certain key frames, import the audio, and then the key frames will play in sync with the audio (ex: a viseme of an &quot;O&quot; shaped mouth key frame that plays when an &quot;Ooh&quot; sound is detected in the audio). This quickens the process of lipsyncing significantly so the artist doesn&#39;t have to manually do it. (Article about the process: https://creativecloud.adobe.com/learn/animate/web/auto-lip-sync-sensei). This differs from AI image generation because the artist still manually draws each mouth asset and makes sure the mouth movement properly syncs with the audio. It still requires an artist, and this need supplies the artist with a job. Another concern with image generation in art is the fact that the AI models are often trained off of scraped images from artists. How AI models such as Midjourney are trained is through images being fed through a training model, the AI studies the images individual pixels, and learns to recognize those pixels. Many of these images used to train these models were scraped from thr internet without asking, or even alerting the creator of the images. This means many artists art is being generated unconsentually used to create ai art.<br/><br/>Potential solution: A license requirement to have access and authorizing use of generative AI. This would include: deep fakes, AI generated voices, AI generated images, and AI generated videos. A license would prove that someone is trusted to responsibly use and own artifical generation. Aditonally, anything created with AI tools should automatically embed information (EX: IP address) of the client so the product can be reversed to find the creator. This could possibly prevent or discouraged malicious uses of AI if the generated objects can be traced back to the creator. However, this could cause privacy issues. To prevent anyone from having free access to a client&#39;s private info, ai companies should have a key that is required to look at the embedded info. These keys would be kept privately within AI generation companies and can only be requested by law enforcement and governments.
