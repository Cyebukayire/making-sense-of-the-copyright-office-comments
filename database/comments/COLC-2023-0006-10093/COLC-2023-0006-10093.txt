My first opposition to Artificial Intelligence comes from being a writer, filmmaker, and lover of those two crafts. I do not wish to see my work and those of others like me diluted by copies of copies of what was once great work. I&#39;d like for us not to lose our jobs in our fields because of Artificial Intelligence either. <br/><br/>Those reasons aside, I am a firm believer that Artificial Intelligence requires the strictest of regulations and that anything less than that will ultimately threaten our economy, our diverse culture, and our democracy. I understand that the desire to innovate is rooted deep within American culture, and I applaud the spirit. But innovation cannot be allowed if what we innovate will hurt those who are not powerful enough to protect themselves. Artificial Intelligence will lead to innovations in medicine, education, manufacturing, and the arts, yes. But at the cost to whom? The workers. What happens to the millions of workers when they no longer have a job that puts food on the table, a roof over their heads, or affordable health care at their disposal? As it stands now, AI will only further the economic inequality we are already facing. If we as a society are serious about eliminating poverty in this country, AI companies must be held under a microscope, their programs micromanaged to the letter, so that they do not damage our economy by being the &quot;cheaper&quot; option. <br/><br/>AI is a tool for us to use, not the other way around. And make no mistake, even in its current form, it is using us. This is evident in labor, where screenwriters and actors have spent months fighting for protections from AI. The same can be said for social media, where AI is used to generate disinformation in the form of imagery and false statements to drive a debate in a certain direction. It is already harder to know what is real and what isn&#39;t when you&#39;re online. Users can disseminate music that sounds like a famous artist such as The Weeknd, when in actuality it is artificially made. How can the AI developers, let alone the users who are complicit in this fraud, get away with this behavior? By claiming &quot;fair use&quot;? By citing copyright law? Retrofitting a law by and for humans to handle companies and their Artificial Intelligence is not an efficient solution. Fair use and copyright law are good, reasonable policies for people to protect themselves against other people. AI is not a person, it has no rights. We should not be afraid to put the full force of the Federal Government to work to drown AI in a sea of regulatory red tape. AI is immensely powerful, and that power is currently being wielded by private citizens at private companies. That is too much power for a non-democratic entity to have.<br/><br/>I&#39;d like to close out my argument by shifting perspective, from macro to micro. Because how we handle AI is not just about the economy or truth as a concept. AI represents a threat to bodily autonomy. If allowed, it WILL meddle in all of our lives. You could receive a phone call from someone claiming to be the payroll accountant at your office. Something&#39;s gone &quot;wrong&quot; in the system, and they need your credentials to get you paid. Of course, they can now steal however much they want from you. You could break up with your boyfriend, and suddenly he&#39;s used your likeness to generate revenge porn which he&#39;s posted online for the world to see. Now, any interested party could say you were anywhere at any time on Earth, and if it&#39;s to their convenience they could generate the &quot;proof&quot;. Is that the world we want to live in? One where you could be tricked into starting a war?<br/><br/>American Innovation has given us incredible technology. It put a man on the moon, for example. But oftentimes, that innovation has served as a double-edged sword. American Innovation gave us the atomic bomb, which ended a World War while also starting another one, with every major power building an arsenal to destroy the world a hundred times over. By now, we should&#39;ve learned our lesson. Because, while past innovations paved the way for us to do new things and go into uncharted territory, Artificial Intelligence can&#39;t do that on the same scale. All it can do is copy our homework without making it look as obvious.
