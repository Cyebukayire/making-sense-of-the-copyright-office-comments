I am a disabled person who uses AI tools for accessibility. As someone who is housebound and mostly bedbound, I worked freelance from my bed for several years before the pandemic hit and I experienced further disease progression that made even sporadic client work impossible for me. I am not reliably able to use my hands for typing or operating a mouse. More often, however, it&#39;s cognitive dysfunction - including executive dysfunction - that prevents me from doing anything capitalism considers &quot;gainful work.&quot; <br/><br/>I have tested and currently use a variety of AI assistants to help me utilize my 1-2 &quot;good hours&quot; per day to try to create things I hope will be able to produce income from, both written word and visual art projects. I am a writer and editor, by previous profession, and have always dabbled in simple graphic design. For years, I have used Canva to create eye-catching graphics for blog posts, social media posts, published articles, and other marketing purposes. It takes less effort - less human input - for me to create beautiful in Canva than it takes for me to create using AI tools. <br/><br/>As my professional background is in writing, I have always painted pictures with words. That was metaphorical, and now AI diffusion models like Midjourney paint pictures with my words quite literally. Just like poetry is different than technical writing - while both qualifying as &quot;writing&quot; that is copyrightable - writing AI prompts is a different kind of writing. I cannot physically draw, paint, or use advanced functions in image editing software such as Photoshop because of my particular combination of disabilities. This has been true even before I experienced severe disease progression that limited my mobility and ability to work on someone else&#39;s deadline. With Midjourney, however, art creation has finally become *accessible* to me. No one tries to claim that the software that gave Stephen Hawking a mechanical voice was the author of his work - which included not only his scientific papers and speeches, but voice acting credits on several animated TV shows. Stephen Hawking was the mind behind the mechanical words, and he was rightfully credited for his work. When disabled people like me cannot control a stylus or a mouse to use Photoshop, but we can use words to sculpt latent space into an intentional output, why should we not be allowed to take credit for our creations? We are the minds behind our carefully crafted prompts and intentional curation of desirable versus undesirable output.  To the best of our abilities, we use image editing tools to tweak our created images for brightness/contrast, pre-AI Photoshop filters, AI-assisted Photoshop functions, cropping, resizing, adding text, etc. Some people don&#39;t even have *those* abilities, and raw AI output *is* the best of their abilities. Why are we allowed to use accessibility tools as reasonable accommodations for everything BUT our creative endeavors? This is inherently discriminatory.<br/><br/>I also use Sudowrite and ChatGPT as writing assistants. I&#39;ve used them to edit my existing works and to start new projects. As someone said in an interview I can&#39;t locate right now, AI tools are essentially giving us all an infinite number of virtual interns to help us accomplish our goals - creative or otherwise. <br/><br/>While it is technically possible to write a book from start to finish with Sudowrite or a similar tool without editing the output, such a book would likely have little appeal for traditional reading audiences. The vibrant user communities for these tools are well-versed in the common problems that crop up in generated text, so an unedited AI-assisted book would primarily be of value only to experimental readers interested in studying how an AI tool follows the instructions dictated by the writer. Any writer who uses Sudowrite or other AI writing assistant knows that a single word in a prompt can change the entire direction of generative text, so the virtually infinite combinations of prompts of various lengths will produce an exponentially larger number of possible outputs. The better the prompts, the more intentional the output. But even intentional output requires additional editing by the human writer to create something marketable.<br/><br/>I use Sudowrite and ChatGPT to help me generate a synopsis, outline, and beats for each chapter by organizing the information I feed it when I Braindump all of the details I already know about the story I want to write, the story no one else has chosen to write. The planning is often the hardest part when you are neurodivergent. Even when I have Sudowrite generate chapter text for me, I rewrite 80% of it myself. But I&#39;m also writing plugins to help me with editing tasks I used to perform with ease that I am no longer capable of. With AI tools, I can finish the manuscript that has been collecting dust for over a decade. AI is allowing me to finish my creative work that would otherwise never be completed due to disability.
