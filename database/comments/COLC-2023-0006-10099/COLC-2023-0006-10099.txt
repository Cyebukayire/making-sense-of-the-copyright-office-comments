I really do hate this, I hate this a lot because it&#39;s obviously a case of both humanity being brain dead and also complacent about everything much to the point that -- it&#39;s highlighting a HUUUGE detriment of how and what way we do things. But in the same spectrum, I understand the &quot;why disconnected corporations want to do this&quot; as well as the &quot;how they can get away with it&quot; 101 clauses because they&#39;ve been rich people, etc, have been exploiting systems for years.<br/><br/>The AI Bro conversations are pretty self evident of that the most. When entering the field of both artistic design, engineering and/or programming you want the work you put into for it to be feeling like, you earn it. A fair achievable goal but the problem is when computers start cutting into the line of that &quot;ability&quot; it can seem tedious and uninteresting. WHich goes to show thta  &quot;oh hey I do such and such for a living, it took me this far to get here but&quot; the but implies that artificial intelligence is going to fix everything when in reality it&#39;s short term fixation that only covers up human short comings but do doesn&#39;t directly teach one HOW TO IMPROVE just skips over the learning process and makes feeling like getting into art is kind of a joke if general male joe can just simply abuse a generation 1-10 times per a hour, get what they want and &quot;feel&quot; like they &quot;accomplished something.&quot;<br/><br/>Swinging back around to the tedium part, the point I&#39;m trying to get across is that you want to be able to say that the AI programs can complimentary skip the tedium trial part of the artistic issue such as programming for around 10-15 hours a day to just set something else up BEFORE you can even get down to the creative part, you know, the kind that allows you make go &quot;hey that&#39;s the kind of stuff I want to grind out for&quot;, I&#39;d say yeah I agree because to some extent -- it just validates the claim of AI can just code that for you while you actually get to do the fun part of the programming i.e. modeling a character or coloring them or even crafting a city landscape.<br/><br/>But what bad comes from w/o regulation of this ends up with corpos wanting the wipe the slate clean of any creative vision or narrative creative vision and/or integrity all for the sake of a bean counter going up, a metric projection that wasn&#39;t really a high enough milestone. And as Michael from Bellular News put it:<br/><br/>To quote &quot;...I do NOT trust the industry to try to use this in the laziest, worst way to just reduce the amount of humans that are working on these projects in a way that is completely uncaring of the Artistic Integrity of the experience&quot; which the generators bros continue to be missing the point but I don&#39;t consider &quot;dilute&quot; responses to be any form of intelligent conversation. It&#39;s like, you sacrifice the human spirit of creative integrity and all for what? So we can be spoon fed into something so hollow, corporate and just... gross?<br/><br/>To end on his point, &quot;This is the same reason you know things would have breath of a experience, I am fime with a human working with thing as a tool to help the human do better work but we all KNOW the big wigs would rather replace the humans and that&#39;s the bit that&#39;s sad.&quot; :) <br/><br/>Which is why we must stand up to protect our fields we work in, not just gaming industry, or acting or voice acting -- this is going to have ripple effects eventually it&#39;ll bleed into everything else then folks&#39;ll be saying, &quot;would&#39;ve could&#39;ve should&#39;ve&quot; fought harder.. well? Get to it but don&#39;t be surprised if someone says I told you so and did nothing. Lack of care =/= complacency ergo being spoon feed =/= taking an &quot;easy&quot; way out for things and not putting forth effort.
