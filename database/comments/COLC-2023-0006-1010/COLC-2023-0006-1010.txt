You have the opportunity to make a better future possible, if only in a small way, by refusing copyright to AI-generated materials. At minimum, doing so would put a brake on a technology whose only benefits accrue to multi-national corporations and the obscenely wealthy at the expense of regular people. Banning AI-generated content is impossible -- but making AI-generated works public domain by default (or simply non-copyrightable) would reduce the incentive to use it in ways that will destroy people&#39;s livelihoods. But, of course, you wouldn&#39;t do something like that. Not a single person in the entirety of our government, at any level, gives a flying fuck at the moon about doing right by the people they purport to govern. I&#39;m sure whatever you do will be signed off on by Viacom and Disney, and I&#39;ll be told I don&#39;t need to worry my pretty little head about it. I love living in a corporate oligarchy!
