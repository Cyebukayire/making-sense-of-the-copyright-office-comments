I truly believe that as artists we should have a right to our artworks, there&#39;s been copyright legislation created to protect those rights, until now. AI is stealing, scraping and destroying the works of artists, but other professionals as well, any form of content that can be used to feed image, text, music, video to AI is being threatened. Our creative freedom, our livelihoods, and even our mental health is at stake. Countless times have I have had to reconsider all my life&#39;s work and dedication, when AI is being chosen above my skills, because it&#39;s cheaper to pay for an AI license than paying the working hours of an artist. It&#39;s destroying the future of media, and it will greatly impact human creativity and freedom.<br/>Not only we haven&#39;t had support from governments, but also we&#39;ve had to take matters into our own hands and adopt protective measures by using Glaze and Nightshade to protect our artworks. It&#39;s disheartening to see that no laws have been put into practice to truly protect us.
