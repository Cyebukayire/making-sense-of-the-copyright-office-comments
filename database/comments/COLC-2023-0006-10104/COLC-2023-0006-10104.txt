There is nothing &lsquo;fair&rsquo; about the use of copyrighted material, without permission, compensation, or even notification, to train software that directly competes with the owners of those copyrights.  <br/>I am an academic librarian, well-versed in fair use cases and used to explaining its applicability to recalcitrant faculty members.<br/>It is true that there is a good argument to be made that generative AI training use of copyrighted material is &#39;transformative.&#39; However, this is but one factor of fair use-- and not even the whole factor.  Transformative though it may be, the use is unarguably commercial, with companies profiting tremendously off of their use of the material.  <br/>In addition, this training paradigm fails every other fair use factor.  Of course, some of the data in the training material is not under copyright, and indeed not copyrightable at all, but there is undoubtedly huge amounts of creative, copyrighted, and copyrightable materials contained therein.  One of the many problems with this issue is the total opacity of what is in the data sets being used.  In the case of many generative AI companies, there has been no responsible data curation; the companies themselves do not know what is in their training data.  <br/>The training data were copied in their entirety, and some of it was even illegally obtained. There must be accountability for these actions.  Tech companies have faced no consequences and apparently feel no compunction at &#39;disrupting&#39; entire markets.  Which is, of course, the last and arguably the most important factor of fair use: effect on the market.  And what could be more negatively impactful on the creative market than replacing human artists and creators with software and algorithms?  That these algorithms were trained on the very creations of those whose livelihoods and vocations are now threatened adds insult to injury.<br/>In the past, the technology industry has benefitted from growing too big, too fast for the staid wheels of bureaucracy to keep up.  Luckily, it seems to me that current law already provides adequate recourse: the use of copyrighted material to train generative AI systems without permission and compensation violates U.S. copyright law.
