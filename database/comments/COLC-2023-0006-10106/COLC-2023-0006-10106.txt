I submit my views in reply to the initial comment period, during which you received arguments that the government should sanction the unpermissioned use of literature and other works of authorship for AI training, which in essence would hand AI companies an unprecedented, unnuanced, fair use doctrine and the profits that would go with it.<br/><br/>Imagine a society where creative work is like housework&mdash;devalued tasks with little or no appeal to talented, curious people. In this world the industries and institutions that give us the music, theater, dance, movies, fine arts, and books that delight and educate our youngest citizens to our oldest wither away because they cannot provide a living to their creators. In this world our schools and universities no longer teach the devalued arts and letters. Over time government for and by an educated, engaged citizenry is supplanted by the shadow rule of haves over have-nots.  This dystopic story line is not inevitable, but the will to take deliberate steps to protect the value of human creativity has never been more essential.  As the president of and investor in our country&rsquo;s largest and oldest independent publisher owned entirely by its employees, I urge the Copyright Office to recognize that the publishing industry serves society by investing in and lawfully disseminating authorship.  This work to society&rsquo;s shared benefit requires enforceable copyrights; without them it will surely wither.  A strong copyright framework is not an obstacle to the well-being of our country; to the contrary, it is indispensable to a healthy civil society.  <br/><br/>Julia Reidhead <br/>Chairman and President <br/>W.
