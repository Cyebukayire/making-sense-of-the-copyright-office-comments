I&#39;m a tech professional, musician, and photographer with an education in art. I think some AI art should be able to be copyrighted, but with some caveats and restrictions. Some AI tools allow you to use the names of specific artists or their style in your prompt, I think that should be outright disqualification right there. I also think any submission should include the prompt along with the image, video, or piece of music. However, the vast majority of AI tools require human input and guidance. It&#39;s a misconception that they &quot;do all the work&quot; any more than a camera or paintbrush does. AI tools are constantly evolving and I think the technology needs to intelligently avoid plagiarism, which it certainly can. But I am 100% in favor of certain AI works being copyrighted.
