I don&rsquo;t believe any work produced by an artificial intelligence should be able to be copyrighted. Especially because many A.I. models today that produce images, text, audio, or video are trained off works made by human artists, more often then not without their consent. The idea that someone could train an A.I. on the work of an employee or contract worker, then take that person off the payroll when the A.I. is good enough to replicate their work and have copyright over the A.I.-generated work is unethical. A.I. is not a tool in the same way a tablet or a digital music-making program is, A.I. generation skips over the bulk of the creative process in a way that is harmful to artists and fundamentally opposed to the concept of art itself.
