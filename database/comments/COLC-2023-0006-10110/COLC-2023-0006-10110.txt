I have worked professionally in what is now unfortunately known as &quot;content creation&quot; for over thirty years, as a composer, filmmaker, and writer.  It is preposterous to me that the creators of AI systems have been allowed to train their lucrative software using the creative work of others without permission or compensation.  I implore the U.S. Copyright Office to require consent from creatives to allow their work to be used in such a manner, and compensation for those whose work has been so exploited.
