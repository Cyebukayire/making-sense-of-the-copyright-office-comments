My friends, my coworkers, my family members. Have spent years and money to learn our crafts. It took extra time to practice and vet to where we are today. Once we reached the workforce we found that clients already don&#39;t understand vocational skills that they exploited us. We were underpaid. We had to teach our skills just to make ends meat and had to keep practicing in our free time just to reach other subjective standards. Being unemployed is a nightmare as an artist when nobody values your work. It is a nightmare when you spend years studying and practiced in any domain to become a professional while the uneducated (and tone deaf rich) masses devaluates you. <br/><br/>And now our art (including that of my family) is used without our permission to put money in the pockets of anonymous people who have nothing to do with our craft.<br/><br/>A.i: steals jobs, data and our art.<br/>A.i: can not generate art without being trained on countless of art pieces, film photos, 3d data, text. Which it has been, by stealing all this material from artists without their consent. And the actual training was done by people in underdeveloped countries (of which i knew one) who sit for hours watching and reading these materials and having to deacribe them.....at a very low salary.<br/><br/>A.i. is not progress, it is plagiarism and exploitation.
