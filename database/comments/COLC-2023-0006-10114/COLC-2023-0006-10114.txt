Greetings. I am a former theater professional and now work in the field of AI for unmanned aerial vehicle deployment. I have been disturbed by images generated through AI created by consuming content of human authorship. The goal of AI is to remove as much human element as possible, and generative AI is doing just that. Even with a human teaching the software what to do, the human themselves is not actually creating something new. It&#39;s plagiarism. There needs to be legislation around AI and machine learning where it regards creative authorship and copyrighted works. We wouldn&#39;t allow a young human to copy from various works to create something of their own without consequence so why are we allowing ai companies to do so? Who ultimately stands to gain? The AI software or the company behind it that will rake in profits created from the actual creative work of other people who are not compensated or recognized in the use of their work. There must be limits and there must be legislation to create rules around this. Human beings do not self regulate as a group. We do not take care of each other or make sure resources are well shared. Rules have to be in place to protect human creators. Rules have to be in place to disclose to the public when AI has been used. Imagine the chaos that occurs when AI creates a deep fake image or video and millions of Americans accept it as truth, which we have already seen happen. Please take this threat seriously and put Rules in place to protect human artists.
