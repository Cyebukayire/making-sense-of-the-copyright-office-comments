Anyone who takes a piece of art to put it in an AI generator is commiting theft and copyright infringement, plain and simple. And no artist would agree to have his/her pieces used in AI because they gain nothing from it, and it devalues their work. Companies have already started using AI as a way to not pay for actual labor, and if this keeps going like this many artist jobs could very well stop existing. Not to mention the risk that AI voices pose. What if someone were to take the audio of a political figure and use AI to spread rumors and misinformation? It poses a legitimate risk for that person&#39;s safety.
