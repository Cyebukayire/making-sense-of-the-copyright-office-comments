Firstly I would like to thank the Copyright Office for allowing me to voice my opinions about the topic of AI. I am a creative professional who&rsquo;s deeply concerned about the future of the creative industries and the future of our society. Since the release of several generative AI models last year, I have witnessed countless examples of abuse, not only on the individual level, but to the point of damaging entire communities. This happened for several reasons: because AI models were released publicly without any protections or guardrails and also due to AI models being trained on large quantities of private and copyrighted data. Not only did the AI companies not ask for consent, but they also didn&rsquo;t intend to compensate the creators, whose works were used for their commercial products. Apart from this, the amount of misinformation and scams has skyrocketed. It&rsquo;s getting increasingly more difficult to distinguish truth from fake.<br/><br/>I am writing to ask for urgent regulation on AI; the algorithmic disgorgement of all generative AI models and for AI companies to be held accountable.<br/><br/>There are plenty of examples that show copyrighted work being used to train the AI models. Generated images show watermarks like the Getty watermark and they also show familiar images resembling the famous photograph &ldquo;Afghan Girl&rdquo; by Steve McCurry or super-hero characters from Marvel. AI and Tech companies have gone so far in their transgressions, because they haven&rsquo;t faced consequences, thus their sense of impunity grows increasingly larger. In an interview with Forbes, the Midjourney Founder David Holz, blatantly said that the dataset was built from scraping the Internet and that he doesn&rsquo;t intend to compensate the creators of the work he stole.<br/><br/>As an artist, posting my work online is how I market myself, in an effort to be seen by potential new clients/employers. Unfortunately with generative AI, this means that my work is now highly vulnerable to theft, which has been a constant source of anxiety. This sick environment is not conducive to innovation or creativity. At the same time, these AI models created a huge imbalance, giving even more power to corporations who will gladly implement the use of these exploitative software to increase profits and to layoff employees.<br/><br/>Because of this artists were forced to defend themselves. Experts at the University of Chicago created &ldquo;Glaze&rdquo;, a software that enables artists to protect the art they post online. Even though I&rsquo;m truly grateful for having &ldquo;Glaze&rdquo;, this is not enough. We need strong regulation alongside these initiatives.<br/><br/>Current opt-out systems unfortunately do not work. We need full transparency on what the datasets are built on. How are creators supposed to know if their work is in the datasets? Should they need to opt-out every single time a new AI model is released? Tech companies shouldn&rsquo;t opt-in their software users/clients by default on having their data trained by AI.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s getting more and more difficult to navigate this world as a creative individual. This makes me fear for future generations that might have less opportunities than me to build a viable career out of making art. I believe that culture is an important part of humanity and preserving a place in society for creative minds will lead to a healthy society. We must act as quickly as possible. Thank you.
