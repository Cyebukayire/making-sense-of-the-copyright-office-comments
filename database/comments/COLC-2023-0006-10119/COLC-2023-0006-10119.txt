It is a FAIR USE for an AI program to include in its &ldquo;training&rdquo; copyrighted material.  No single copyrighted work makes up more than a minuscule proportion of an AI program data base.  Items that make up our culture must be included royalty free in AI learning.  Requiring royalties will disable AI progress for all but the biggest richest companies.
