The use of AI in creative fields is a serious risk to professional artists, writers, and others who depend on their intellectual property for income. It &quot;creates&quot; by taking from existing material and creating a mediocre, homogenized version of a product. We are already seeing the issues with this in the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, in which creators are fighting against the danger of having their work or likenesses held in perpetuity for the sake of feeding an AI algorithm, effectively cutting them out of the creative process. For these reasons, the following are necessary:<br/>a) AI creations cannot be deemed eligible for copyright, especially when it uses the intellectual property of creators without their consent;<br/>b) Creators must have the ability to prevent their works from being scraped by an AI algorithm;<br/>c) AI creations must be clearly identifiable as such in order to prevent a surge in misinformation and misattributed work.
