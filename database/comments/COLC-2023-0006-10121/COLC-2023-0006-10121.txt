Let actors and all people own copyright or there own image and likeness , AI threatens the very essence of film making not only will actors have to compete against human actors but AI objects! This should not be allowed! There should be a law that AI objects cannot take the role from a speaking actor . And actors shouldn&rsquo;t have to compete with dead actors or actors who are living now everyone is competing with Tom cruise when he was 25 this threatens the very core of the film industry no actors = no stunt , no crew no wardrobe , no hair and casting it threatens the entire film industry they are trying to take humans out of entertainment please help stop this - a concerned actor.
