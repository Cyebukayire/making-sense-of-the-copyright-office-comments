My name is Jason Spencer. I have an MS in computer science and I work at Google using machine learning for product development. I believe that using copyrighted material to produce new media will soon be automated to the point that it will require little human effort to produce. Creating Frank Sinatra singing the new Taylor Swift song will only require access to Sinatra recordings and the single Swift recording, all readily available with Spotify. The tooling will soon make the rest just a button press.<br/><br/>But what would give value to such a derivative work is not the button press, but rather the fact that it&#39;s Sinatra&#39;s voice. Likewise, what adds value to chat GPT will soon be less about the model that&#39;s trained, but access to the huge body of content created for consumption on the internet. The training and process will shortly be effortless.<br/><br/>As a programmer, thinking of AI bots writing programs trained from code I have posted on GitHub feels like a violation of the trust and spirit with which that code was offered to the public. That code was put there to allow persons to advance their own private needs, not to allow corporations to develop the means to replace programmers and have custom code generated with a voice query. Such technology would be enormously valuable, and if a corporation developed it entirely from their own content, I would applaud them, and they&#39;d be entitled to every penny. A person who can generate a recording of Frank singing Tay-Tay THAT USED ZERO COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL FROM FRANK would indeed be entitled to the hard-earned value of that work. But with the tooling advancing as it is, I believe pointing it at internet archives to extract tons of value that others have added and repackaging it for private interest will soon not reflect a significant new contribution to humanity, and will instead eclipse the contributions made the old-fashioned way <br/><br/>I believe that training AI based on other works is currently very impressive, but in the long run is really just a derivative work with less and less value as the tooling matures. I believe it is in the public interest to help preserve the value of human-created content as primary to incentivise creativity and honest work. Content created or trained with no other training input is unique and original; content synthesizesd by skimming other works owes its value to those works. If a company can build an algorithm to generate programs, they deserve credit (and liability) for that product. But creating it by skimming others&#39; work without permission seems a violation.
