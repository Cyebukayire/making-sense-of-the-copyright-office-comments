As a gallery artist, commercial artist, commercial designer, and musician, I would sincerely hope to retain the rights to the imagery, sound and style of my creative works. The ability and talent to create something unique has been cultivated from many hard years of education, personal experimentation, and is a gift from God. It simply is not fair or morally right for a computer owned by a commercial company to secretly and deliberately search for and find human produced artwork using artificial intelligence and use it without consent for any means - especially for profit.<br/><br/>Would it be right for a large furniture manufacturer to take parts handcrafted by independent professional woodworkers without there consent, acknowledgement or compensation, and resell them as part of their furniture? Would it be right for a large fast food chain to watch, record and learn how an independent professional chef creates beautiful delicious meals without his consent, and then recreate the exact same recipes for mass production without any acknowledgement or compensation?<br/><br/>All creative individuals manifest newness in their chosen fields which not only inspire and awe, but begin a chain reaction of innovation that reaches into all parts of society. Please support us artists so that the United States of America continues to be a leader in innovation in all fields. Please do not let technology companies indiscriminately use our creative works with the newly evolving capacities of artificial intelligence, in any medium, and without proper legal consent, acknowledgement, and compensation. <br/><br/>We hope that you will do your duty to recognize and protect artists&#39; worth in society and in the economy. Thank you for your thorough time and consideration in this matter,<br/><br/>Papaha Jeff Gosline
