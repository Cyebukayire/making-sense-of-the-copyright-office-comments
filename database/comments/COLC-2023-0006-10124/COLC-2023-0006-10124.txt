I am an artist whose work has been &quot;scraped&quot; and I am fine with it. I have also generated with AI and I would call it a tool, provided it is used that way. As a tool AI has enormous potential. I would be for people being able to copyright works created with AI and I would argue that our standard of art as a society can only progress from this point. I do not believe we can go back. If artists have incentive to use AI (the right to copyright) they are more likely to participate and elevate the content, move with the times. People are naturally afraid but I think it&#39;s the only viable way forward. Other countries are not likely to limit the use of AI so the flood of art will be there either way. In strongly urge you to either make it copyrightable or create a new kind of protection that would allow people to benefit from it financially. There will be enough jobs lost, create more this way.
