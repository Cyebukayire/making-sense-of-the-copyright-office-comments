AI art should not be eligible for copyright. There must be extremely strict regulations for using a person&rsquo;s likeness/voice and/or their prior cultural contributions to train AI. Works made using AI must be subject to rigorous human scrutiny due to the frequency of errors in AI reasoning. For example, an AI search bot was asked to name a country in Africa that started with &ldquo;K,&rdquo; the AI responded, &ldquo;There are 54 countries in Africa but none start with &lsquo;K.&rsquo; The closest is Kenya, which starts with a &lsquo;Kuh&rsquo; sound.&rdquo; This tool&rsquo;s usefulness has been wildly overstated.
