It&#39;s insane that you&#39;re even debating this. Rich tech venture capital and hedge-fund backed scumbags are stealing people&#39;s intellectual property to train machines to plagiarize actual people&#39;s work. There is literally zero benefit to society, and this only enriches garbage people who added zero value to the intellectual property actual artists and writers produced. AI generated works should never get copyright protection.
