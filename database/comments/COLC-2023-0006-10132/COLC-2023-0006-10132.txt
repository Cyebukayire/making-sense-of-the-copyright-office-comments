I support the efforts of people who generate AI imagery. This is a tool that can be used for both good or bad purposes. But I firmly stand behind peoples&#39; good judgment to make that call.<br/><br/>As a software developer interested in this field, I see every day comments and rants from anti-AI people who have no idea how the technology works. They see and end results and make all manner of unfounded assumptions about how it was achieved. That cannot be the basis for any kind of copyright policy, which should be focusing on whether or not end results are sufficiently similar to an original work to qualify as a derivative work, and whether or not the conditions around training AI models constitutes fair use.<br/><br/>As for the actual protection of copyright, we do not claim that an artist who produces a work using subject matter in the public domain is denied copyright of their work, and as such mere usage of an AI imagery tool should not render a work immediately un-copyrightable. Due to the changing nature of the technology, in many cases it can be that a work created solely with an AI tool today becomes impossible to re-create in the tool tomorrow, even when using the precise same inputs, thus making that image completely unique in its own right. Furthermore, if an artist starts with an AI image and then alters it using their own judgment in order to fulfill a specific artistic vision, this, too, should not have copyright protection withheld unless, again, the end result could be classified as a derivative work. Many, many artistic processes begin with content that is not owned by the artist, but through substantial manipulation by their own efforts becomes a transformative original work solely due to their effort.<br/><br/>AI is no doubt a serious challenge to many preconceived notions of what constitutes &quot;art&quot;, but copyright is about protected an original author&#39;s work from being unduly used and credited as belonging to others. If a non-AI work infringes on copyright or trademark, it&#39;s because there is a quantifiable human understanding of considerable similarity or use of recognizable privately-owned content in the offending work. If an AI creates a picture of a knight in armor riding a horse shaped like an automobile and uses an known artist&#39;s name to simulate a particular style of painting -- but the end result looks nothing like any work that artist or any other has produced -- then that work cannot and should not be held in violation of copyright, and if the creator used their own vision and effort to assist in creating the image, it should be protected.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking time to read this.
