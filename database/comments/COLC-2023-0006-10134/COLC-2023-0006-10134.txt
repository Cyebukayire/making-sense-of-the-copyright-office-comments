Extremely concerned about AI companies getting a &quot;free pass&quot; to feed copyrighted material into their models and generate content based off of copyrighted material.  Literally no business in history has gotten raw material for free to feed &amp; build their business.  There has to be a mechanism for original copyright owners to be paid by the AI companies using their work to train their models, whether the original copyright owners are large companies like publishing houses or the original artists or individuals who created the original work that is being fed into AI to train it.
