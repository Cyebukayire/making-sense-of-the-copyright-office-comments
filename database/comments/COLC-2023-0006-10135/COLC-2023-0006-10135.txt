AI will certainly lead to the loss of many jobs for a wide number of professions. As a professional photographer now in my 28th year in business I am already seeing the impact of AI imaging options affecting my income and the availability of photography assignments. Since AI imagery has been created through all of our collective images and without our express permission this is an area that needs regulation immediately. I am not sure what the solution is, since AI technology is already rife in everyday use but at the very least it must be labeled as AI and not as photography or art from a human. Please intervene on the behalf of small businesses everywhere in the creative space.
