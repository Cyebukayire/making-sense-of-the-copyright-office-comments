For a broad sector of business the goal of A.I. has been to mimic the work of modern creators, living people or bodies of work belonging to their estates.   This mimicking is not simply working within a style, such as Art Nouveau or Art Deco.  A.I. is used to develop an extremely detailed catalog of nuances so fine that this reflects the very body mechanics of an individual painting with a sable brush, or technique and tuning of a specific musician on their own instrument, for instance.  I have read about entertainment executives considering a vast reduction in personnel costs using A.I.  The &lsquo;captured&rsquo; abilities of human beings will exists within lines of code, never to earn a living for anyone again, except for a few executives and shareholders.  Invention and other creative endeavors have been the life blood of the United States, more than ever as the mills and manufacturing began to fade away.  If Big Data and entertainment conglomerates are given a license to just take the last measure of a citizen&rsquo;s talents, then the vitality of a nation will be funneled into a few finely tailored pockets.  Maybe a few executives and shareholders are all that have mattered for awhile.  The rest of us are simply grist for their own special mill.
