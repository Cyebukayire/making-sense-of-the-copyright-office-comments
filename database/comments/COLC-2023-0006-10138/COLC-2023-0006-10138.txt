While I am generally in favor of the use of artificial intelligence in the creation of works, I do believe it is necessary for big tech companies to acknowledge the debt they owe to content creators whose works they unlawfully scraped using torrents (pirated works) to build their engines. If these were private individuals instead of public entities, there would be no question of prosecuting them under the fullest extent of the law. Are companies such as Open AI, Facebook, and Microsoft so big that the US fails to see a need to hold them responsible when they&#39;ve admitted to breaking the law to make a profit? If so, this sets a dangerous precedent under the law for future copyright holders, stating that the US will not defend individual citizens against corporations if they bring suit, regardless of the validity of the claim.<br/><br/>In addition, there needs to be regulation of the AI interfaces to prevent copyright holders from future &quot;acquisitions&quot; of their work for training purposes with neither appropriate consent nor compensation. If I decided to learn a skill by stealing books from the bookstore, I&#39;d be responsible for the theft. This is no different. The use case is irrelevant. &quot;Fair use&quot; does not entitle big tech companies to steal works in whole, incorporate the complete texts into algorithms for profit, and then state that those works are of negligible merit within the whole, and thus not worthy of protection. Demeaning the works does not change the facts - if the big tech companies didn&#39;t need the works, they wouldn&#39;t have stolen them in the first place.<br/><br/>Lastly, copyright law needs to establish clear boundaries regarding what is and is not &quot;created&quot; by AI. Just as photographers can acquire copyright for pictures created with filtering effects, authors, musicians, and artists need rules specifying exactly how much and what kind of content generated by AI falls over the line. Is a work edited by AI still eligible? If a first draft of a book is generated by AI and then the author writes a secondary draft over it, is it eligible? If a musician writes a song and records it with the aid of an AI voice amplifying or harmonizing with their own, is the song eligible? Without boundaries, creators lack protection for their work, and thus protection if AI companies attempt to make a profit off a work created with help from their algorithms. These considerations should all be taken into account when future laws are written regarding what can and cannot be protected under copyright law.
