If someone&#39;s work is going to be fed into a slurry of AI data, they should be given the opportunity to give (or deny) permission and profit from the use of their work. Given that smaller creators and individual artists have been disproportionately harmed and occasionally outright targeted (and due to the history of larger corporations abusing copyright law), I&#39;d love to see enforcement efforts focus on a small claims, class-action, or some similar approach that primarily empowers individual artists and creators to seek damages, ideally with protections in place to avoid them getting stonewalled with legal fees and the like.
