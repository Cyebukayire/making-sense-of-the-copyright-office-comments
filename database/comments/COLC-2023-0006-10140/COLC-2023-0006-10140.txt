As an actor and performing artist, I fear that AI will replace me in films, television, commercials, and voice overs. My union SAG AFTRA is currently negotiating a new contract that will allow this. If actors were allowed to copyright their likenesses/images, then we would own our likenesses, rather than the production companies owning them, which is the direction of the new contracts. AI programs will be fed films I have acted in and copy my likeness and reproduce it, without my consent and without any compensation to me.<br/>As  writer, I object to AI writing programs that infringe on my copyrighted screenplays. These AI programs must be fed existing IP in order to copy and produce new content.
