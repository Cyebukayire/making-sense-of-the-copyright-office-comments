I do not think that Artificial Intelligence models should be allowed to be trained on copyrighted works, whether that be literary, visual, or audio. The models &ldquo;learn&rdquo; using that copyrighted source material and then generate new content that is wholly derivative of these original, protected works. Furthermore, allowing AI generated content to be copyrighted seems to allow these machines and their creators to profit off of the originality and creativity of actual humans that used inspiration to create, as opposed to code that allows supercomputers to read every work in existence in mere days. To me, the heart of the issue is that Artificial Intelligence, by definition, can not truly be &ldquo;creative&rdquo;, and therefore their creations should not benefit from the protections of copyright law. I believe that the matters discussed in this notice are going to evolve at a pace so rapid that if new rules and regulations aren&rsquo;t implemented immediately, it will be incredibly difficult if not impossible to reign in in the future. Please do not succumb to the big tech companies and their powerful lobbies and protect human creators and their creations from predatory AI practices.
