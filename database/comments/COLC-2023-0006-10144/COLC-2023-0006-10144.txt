The use of copyrighted material to train artificial intelligence (AI) is a complex issue with no easy answers. There are both potential benefits and risks associated with this practice.<br/>On the one hand, using copyrighted material can provide AI with a rich and diverse dataset to learn from. This can help AI to develop a better understanding of the world and to generate more creative and original outputs.<br/>On the other hand, using copyrighted material without permission can raise legal and ethical concerns. Copyright holders have the right to control how their works are used, and unauthorized use of copyrighted material can infringe on their rights. Additionally, using copyrighted material to train AI can raise concerns about bias and fairness. If AI is trained on a dataset that is not representative of the real world, it may produce outputs that are biased or unfair.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>
