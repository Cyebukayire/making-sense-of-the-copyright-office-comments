Machine learning algorithms are capable of impressive feats by interpreting massive amounts of input data (training datasets) in order to condition a model for further use. <br/><br/>New to public perception, generative models can output information (text, images, video, audio, etc.) that at first glance appears indistinguishable from the dataset it was trained on. <br/><br/>Despite this similarity, the method by which these models generate their output doesn&#39;t directly utilize any of the input data. There is no model I know of that is capable of even checking its output against the dataset(s) it was trained on, let alone using copyrighted material directly. <br/><br/>Any claim of copyright infringement falls on its face at this step. This model, conditioned with copyrighted material, is incapable of generating an infringing passage except by chance. <br/><br/>While the AI systems, capable of making familiar looking passages or images, may seem to represent a threat to publishers, their use of the material is fair use in my opinion. <br/><br/>A common argument to support a claim of fair use is that the content in question represents a &quot;transformative&quot; use of the copyrighted work. This seems self-evident for the case of large language models such as OpenAI&#39;s GPT series. <br/><br/>Another factor, from https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/index.html states: &quot;Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole&quot; as a key determinant of fair use. Seeing as these models can hardly be said to produce copyrighted material at all, it seems to me that fair use as currently understood completely shields most AI models from being considered as infringing. <br/><br/>I think the consequences of allowing copyright claims against AI systems will be to enable only large publishers and content owners to seek legal damages, as attributing copyright from an AI&#39;s output will require sifting through hundreds or thousands of carefully crafted prompts to search for a scant few that give the impression of infringement. This abuse could cost any aspiring AI company massively in legal fees, regardless of their use of copyrighted material.
