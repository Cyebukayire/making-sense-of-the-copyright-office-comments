It is of my opinion, under the first amendment we the people are allowed the creation of art under free speech. No matter the inspiration for the art, as long as it is not a direct copy with no credation to the original owner then any human or computer generated image shall be allowed. It is imperative that the official in charge of reading these understand that nit picking of civil rights will inadvertently lead to the removal of all civil rights. They have been carefully chosen due to their great importance to our freedom and pursuit of happiness. If there is no freedom then we as humans will be demoralized and turn away from what makes us human.
