After much research and testing on AI Art, a few things are clear to help with granting copyright on an AI Art Image. When a request is made to copyright artwork, the Tool (AI Generator) and Prompt used must also be submitted for review. This ensures that the creator did not directly use an artist name, or distinct identifiers to create an image in the likeness of art work that would infringe upon another artists&#39; work. In addition - you will need an AI Scientist to help with the understanding of prompts and how to accept/reject copyright request for AI Art. Enforcement must also be put on the tools to block usage of business names, logos, artist names etc. from prompts to protect themselves. There are ways to help using AI. I think as long as the prompts are clean there should be no reason not to accept a copyright request. Think of it like Photoshop, and other tools that aid in designing. Adapting is key. Common Law Copyright must also adapt, where a person creating images and posting them to social media should be protected, as long as they can provide evidence supporting they created the images including prompts etc, Social media platforms should abide and take down any fake accounts stealing art. In my opinion OpenAI/Microsoft/Google/BARD can help with this by creating an AI that can assess images for copyright infringement. I certainly hope my comments can help this process in moving forward with ethical usage of AI Art Generators.
