As an artist, I think AI art can be a helpful tool for inspiration and personal use. However, AI generated works have become actively destructive to artists and their livelihoods. Art is used in these massive datasets without the consent of artists, and is used to create fraudulent works or undercut artists&#39; pay. AI art has a place, but it should not be able to be copyrighted and artists deserve to have a say in whether or not their art can be used in a dataset to generate AI work. I think the current legal precedent set by Naruto v. David Slater et al. (2015) outlining that art is defined as being made by a human hand, and so only those made by humans are elligible for copyright to be appropriate so far, though artists should have additional tools at their disposal to combat their art being used in datasets without their permission.
