I dabble in fan works.  I write fiction and draw art involving other&#39;s intellectual properties (IP).  Fan works are in something in a grey area in USA copyright law; copyrightable and yet not copyrightable.  It is generally understood, or is an uneasy compromise between the owners and the fans, that such works are not used for profit.  <br/><br/>I am rightfully incensed that my unique works very likely were scraped and added to the Common Crawl dataset used to calibrate ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM) created, maintained, and owned by OpenAI.  (See article: https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/25888, &quot;AI and Data Scraping on the Archive.&quot;) <br/> <br/>However, I have a greater fear for myself and other creators: OpenAI (and Microsoft, their business partner) are profiting from ChatGPT.  It may theoretically be argued that I would be implicated in any lawsuit involving the IPs used to calibrate this LLM, even though I never consented to the use of my fan works by OpenAI nor will ever see a penny of the immense profits OpenAI is reaping.<br/><br/>Fan works and fan lore are important to our culture.  It shows how a people saw themselves, each other, and their societal environment of the time.  It spans generations.  Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who, superheroes &mdash; just to name a few examples.<br/><br/>LLMs will only become a more powerful tool as the months and years pass.  Let us not forget in our haste to utilize it that a tool may be used by a people as a force for good and for evil.  We must sit down and decide where the line is drawn.<br/><br/>That line starts with recognizing that data does not magically poof into existence, free for the taking by OpenAI and its corporate peers.  Someone wrote it.  Someone drew it.  It is someone&#39;s very voice!  OpenAI, and its current and future peers, must be forced to be transparent in what is present in the datasets and how they built up those datasets.  There must be regulation that protects those who not only did not consent, but never even had the opportunity to dissent nor recourse to discover if OpenAI, et al, ignored the rights of the creators.
