I would like to share my AI concerns. While not as detailed as I&rsquo;m sure many submissions will be, it is important to share that in an already challenging political environment where we rely on facts and the truth being accurately shared, there are so many situations where AI has already been used to inaccurately portray a politician&rsquo;s words, or use AI to create a video likeness and audio likeness of a politician speaking something they have never said. And the realism of these images makes it very hard to discern what is fact and what is fiction.<br/><br/>We must live in a world where facts and the truth are discernible from fiction, and AI is going in a direction that is making it harder and harder to be able to discern what is real and what is not. We must have legal restrictions regarding AI.<br/>
