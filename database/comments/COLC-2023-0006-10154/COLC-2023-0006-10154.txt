Let&#39;s say you wrote a book. Anyone can physically copy it for free. That&#39;s not good, if you want to sell more than one copy of it. So copyright was invented, to give you the ability to create artificial scarcity, which you can then sell.<br/><br/>Now let&#39;s say an AI company bought one copy of the book, and added it to their training dataset.<br/><br/>Can someone use their AI model to read your book? No, they cannot, because it is highly unlikely that the model was able to memorise your book.<br/><br/>So, if they want to read your book, they still have to pay you. Nothing has changed. That&#39;s why it&#39;s not copyright infringement.<br/><br/>&quot;But why would they want to read my book if they can just make their own?&quot;<br/><br/>That&#39;s just automation. Even if a AI was trained with completely &quot;copyright-safe&quot; data, that issue would still exist. People would still be able to generate their own books.
