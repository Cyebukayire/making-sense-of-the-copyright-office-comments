I am against AI using art from real artist as i think this is stealing. As an artist, opportunities are stolen from me and my art is being used to fuel a machine without my consent. I think AI developers should ask for authorisation from artists before using their art. The USA being the country with the most influence worldwide, them establishing guidelines and laws regarding this would help artists all over the world.
