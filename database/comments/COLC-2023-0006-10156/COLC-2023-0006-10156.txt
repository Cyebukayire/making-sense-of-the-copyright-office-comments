My name is Mark Wilkins. I am a record company owner and a music publisher as well as a songwriter, recording artist and author. I believe that AI-created works should not be copyrightable. They are not original works because they are not created by a human being but by a machine. The Copyright Office was not established to protect works created by a machine but to protect works created by human beings. I believe that AI should be used as a machine to enhance works created by human beings but that human beings should register the original works first to protect the original work as the AI enhancements sill not be copyrightable. <br/>Allowing AI works to be copyrightable creates no actual benefit. It will be devastating to our economy putting huge numbers of creative people out of work. It will create a false economy that benefits only the rich who own movie companies, major record labels and major art houses and book publishers. where movies, music books, and art will be generated by machines and the government will have to create jobs for the millions of people who will be permanently unemployed as creatives. The Copyright Office is a branch of the government and should seriously consider this issue which will create more problems for the government. Keep creativity human and keep creative people employed.<br/>
