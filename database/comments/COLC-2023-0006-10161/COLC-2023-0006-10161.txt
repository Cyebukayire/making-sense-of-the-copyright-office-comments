There are a number of issues that the use of AI in generating new literature (it cannot be called writing)  or using existing literature both for training and accessibility etc. have brought up. All about the rights of authors and their rights to their WORK.  <br/><br/>No matter the format -paperback, ebook, audio book, translation, movie, merchandise. The Work which is the Author&#39;s manuscript is the basis of all. <br/><br/>Copyright is applicable any time when source material is used to make money (now or in future), generate publicity or get credit. <br/><br/>Tech companies are using content to train AI without permission and without payment - the AI is going to make them money, strengthen their brands, and help them in publicising said credentials. So that is a Copyright infringement.<br/><br/>Tech companies are offering to make content accessible by generating audio books for free but expecting the author to give up all rights to it. Unfair trade practices. Not to mention immoral.<br/><br/>Unfair trade practices, Copyright infringement and Immoral. Can we now also make this ILLEGAL?
