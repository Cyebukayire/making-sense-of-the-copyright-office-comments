As a person who makes a living writing fiction, I am in support of preventing AI-generated content from becoming copyrighted. At the very least, the copyrighted works used to train these AI models need to be licensed, giving authors the opportunity to opt out of having their work used to train generative AI models. Crucially, this would also mean ensuring that copyright holders are fairly compensated for the use of their intellectual property. <br/><br/>If some strict and clear regulation doesn&#39;t come into play soon, there&#39;s nothing to prevent someone from taking one of my novels or short stories, feeding it to an AI model, and having that model regurgitate a similar piece of work that could be in direct competition with my work. It&#39;s easy to see how this would stifle creative human expression, not to mention the disastrous effect it would have on the creator economy. It&#39;s also not alarmist to think that it would concentrate the power of creation in the hands of a few massive AI companies, making it that much harder for individuals to make a living in the creative space. <br/><br/>Common sense regulation is sorely needed in regards to AI. And the precedent it will set can help protect human creativity while also allowing for healthy competition in the marketplace. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read this comment.
