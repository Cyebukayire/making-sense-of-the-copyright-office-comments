I am an engineer working on large scale AI systems. AI and AI derived works should never be copyrighted. Even if we can completely trace models&#39; training material to ONLY works in the public domain (which is near-impossible) public domain and Creative Commons 0 licenses make no mention of AI derivation. Many artists, myself included (as a hobby) have uploaded CC0 work but do not consent to its use for AI training.
