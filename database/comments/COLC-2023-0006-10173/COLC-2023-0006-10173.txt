As a SAG-AFTRA member, I am deeply concerned and infuriated about the lack of protections that have fallen on our Union to facilitate this year. AI will be, if it hasn&rsquo;t already, robbing us of our due earnings and jobs. Working actors deserve legal protections from the negative effects AI will have on our livelihoods as tax-paying and law-abiding citizens. I urge you to pass this bill unanimously, and continue to find legal loopholes that allow production companies to cut corners at the cost of our living wages and benefits.
