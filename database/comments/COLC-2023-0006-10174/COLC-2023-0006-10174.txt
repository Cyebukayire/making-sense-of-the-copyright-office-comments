Do not let AI take jobs in the film and TV sector. Y&rsquo;all scream about why does America have poor mental health. Bc we can&rsquo;t even get our basic needs Met and when you take away jobs you take away step one of basic needs. Not only that but Ai as people will be detrimental to mental health for the consumer. Do the Right thing for the PEOPLE not your pockets.
