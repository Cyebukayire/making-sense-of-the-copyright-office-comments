Generative AI is scraping copyrighted content and not paying any licensing fee on the material it uses. If I, as an artist, were to do that with any kind of material, I would be sued as theft. Generative AI programs and databases are therefore stealing.<br/>Generated AI programs should pay licensing fees to any artist whose work has been stolen/scraped, and none of its generated content should be copyrightable or licensed for use, unless all licensing fees should are rightfully paid to the original artists. This is how it work for all other medias, and AI content should also follow these regulations. <br/>It&#39;s very important to note that Generative AI program could *not and would *not function without their databases. Generative AI programs don&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; and aren&#39;t &quot;inspired&quot; by images, text or music like human brains, and they generate nothing new: they mix segments and fragments of pre-existing material without ever inventing or creating. <br/>The companies who developed these programs received funds and earned profits, taking advantage of the hard labor of the artists they stole from. Generative AI programs wouldn&#39;t be generating profit without their databases. The original creators deserve justice and rightful compensation.
