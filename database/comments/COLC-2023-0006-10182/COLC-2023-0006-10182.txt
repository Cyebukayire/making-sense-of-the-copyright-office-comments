As a Union actor, I am very concerned with AI regulations in the US. I know AI has benefits and will continue to be used in filmmaking- but I have concern over employee protections when it comes to AI consent. If an actor does not consent to be scanned, will it cost them the job? We need legal protection stating what companies can and cannot do when it comes to using and creating scans.
