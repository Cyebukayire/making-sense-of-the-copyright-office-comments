While viewing the U.S. Copyright Office Listening Sessions (which were excellent), one argument that I heard repeatedly in support of generative AI technology from some AI developers taking part in these conversations was that we use AI technology already (i.e., Spell checking software and applications which include classification, forecasting and anomaly detection, etc.) and have come to know how valuable and nonthreatening these technologies are.  And given this apparent fact, we should not be wary of incorporating generative AI into our lives on a similar grand scale.  But this conclusion is false and unsupported given that spell checking software and the other applications mentioned above, are not generative AI. I believe that the vast difference between these two types of artificial intelligence technologies needs to be acknowledged, highlighted and addressed first and then followed by a unique response to generative AI as it relates to copyright.  Thank you for all the work that you do.
