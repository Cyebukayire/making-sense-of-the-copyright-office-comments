Hello, I&rsquo;m not from the US, but I would like to give some of my views.<br/><br/>At the very least, I hope the datasets are rebuilt using only data that is respectfully and directly consented to by the original copyright owners. <br/><br/>AI generators has given not just artists, but non-artists a whole set of issues ever since it became easy for individuals who can afford the hardware to utilise them.<br/><br/>People are losing the means to provide for themselves and their families because a machine can replace their jobs. AI supporters will argue that people can learn AI so they won&rsquo;t be replaced, but why would a company keep 50 people who can in fact use AI that effectively replaces 50 person&rsquo;s jobs, when they only need one?<br/><br/>AI is becoming so powerful a tool that a person with little experience in the field AI is good at, may never get a chance to work in that field. It is a convenient tool and convenience is what makes it dangerous.<br/><br/>Its ease of use has given opportunities to those who just want to have good-hearted fun, and those that seek to use it for malicious purposes, like impersonations, scams, misinformation and deepfakes.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve seen what would be called a few good uses of AI generation but we&rsquo;ve seen more bad uses. I think it should be quite clear that AI generators should be highly controlled, if not banned for good.
