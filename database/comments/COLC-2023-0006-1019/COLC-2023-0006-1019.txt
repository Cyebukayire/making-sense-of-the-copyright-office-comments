Copyright law exists to protect the artistic creations of an individual artist or a company which has commissioned an artist. The entire framework exists to give protection and monetary incentive to people to innovate and contribute to society, because their ability to turn a profit from their work is protected. Neural Net or AI generated content absolutely should not, and MUST not be protected as such. NN/AI systems are &ldquo;trained&rdquo; by being fed whole libraries of writing and images created by people (copyrighted material, for which the copyright holder has not given permission nor been compensated) and it is not able to produce original content without trimming and re-arranging the information that was fed in to the system. Every single application of NN/AI is a collage, made of pieces of stolen assets blended at the edges to obfuscate the blatant-ness of its plagiarism. From the most basic theory of the technology, to its EVERY application, NN/AI content being used for profit VIOLATES extant copyright law. More importantly, it will have enormously damaging consequences to the economy of the United States and the world at large. The United States entertainment industry is one of the country&rsquo;s tallest tentpoles. Providing Copyright protection to AI content WILL topple that tentpole, and push the country into it&rsquo;s worst depression ever.<br/><br/>If NN/AI content is protected by copyright law, then it is impossible to protect the rights of both artists, and companies. The entertainment industry will become more volatile than ever. A producer could spit out a complete motion picture with no human input needed, by recycling existing scenes and sequences, putting millions of carpenters, electricians, and specialized technicians out of work, not just tailors and actors. Investing in making an original production will become an untenable expense, as spending millions of dollars to fund years of labour in a film production will be unsafe if a competitor can steal the end product wholesale and run it through an algorithm to create a derivative but legally-distinct copy.<br/><br/>This is ALL that an NN/AI system does. This is ALL it is capable of, and the only thing it was EVER designed or intended to be capable of. It violates copyright, and blends the edges just enough to fool a casual observer into not realizing they&rsquo;re looking at recycled material.<br/>Use of NN/AI violates copyright law. Full stop. There is no nuance, there is no wiggle room, there is no other side of the discussion worthy of consideration. Use of AI VIOLATES COPYRIGHT LAW. It needs to be banned from any and all for-profit use, with strict and serious enough penalties (fines in the tens of billions, to hundreds of billions!) that the trillion-dollar companies investing in it won&rsquo;t just suffer the fine for the benefit of the crime. Failure to do so will roll a proverbial snowball downhill that will quickly become an avalanche that utterly, and irreparably destroys the nation&rsquo;s economy. You are defusing the biggest metaphorical bomb in human history, do not cut the wrong wire.<br/><br/>Do not fuck this up.
