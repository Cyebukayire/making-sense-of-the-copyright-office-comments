As an artist, I find it inconceivable that anyone would think that AI could be protected by copyright. AI steals and recuperates the work of thousands of artists, so how can it claim to deserve copyright? To grant AI this right is to accept and allow copyright to go to thieves and plagiarists. Let&#39;s respect the work of all those human beings who had worked and work now hard to create and invent new works of art every day, and who contribute to enriching our universe and our imagination, to making us dream. <br/>Let&#39;s help artists instead of trying to kill them.
