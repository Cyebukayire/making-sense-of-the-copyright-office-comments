I am a full-time professional photographer. At least 73 of my images (and likely more) were scraped from my website and used without my consent in the LAION 5B training set. This dataset is used to train all commercially available image generation models, including Stable Diffusion, MidJourney, Dall-E and more. I am not only 100% opposed to the idea of being able to copyright images generated with diffusion models, but I also believe that these companies should not be allowed to profit off others&#39; work by stealing it and using it as training data. I am in favor of regulatory action against any company or individual profiting from the use of training data which was gathered and used to train a model without explicit permission from the copyright holder. This is theft, plain and simple.
