AI generated material should not be copyrightable. The purpose of copyright is to protect the creation of an individual or organization. AI however, relies on algorithmically created something new based on thousands of hours of training and outside material fed into it. This includes material that was actually made by a person, often without the permission of the original creator, which leaves that creator in a vulnerable position where the AI can create works similar enough to theirs that they are no longer able to keep up. While AI is a very useful tool, the ability to copyright AI generated material will completely kill off an entire industry of writers and artists, while simultaneously ripping out the heart and soul of the creation.
