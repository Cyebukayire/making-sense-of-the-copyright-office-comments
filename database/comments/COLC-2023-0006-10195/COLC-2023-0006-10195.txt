AI has way too many models made by scraping the internet without the permission of the people they&#39;re taking work from. Especially the rise of AI &quot;art&quot; which uses pieces that are protected without permission to create copies. Really AI is being trained off people&#39;s work who didnt consent to their working being used in that way. The people who use AI are profiting off the copywrited work of others, and because there&#39;s no laws in place, feel the need to be agressive and stubborn.
