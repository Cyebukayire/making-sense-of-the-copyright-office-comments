AI is uncharted territory. Not only for the entertainment industry, but all industry. As an actor, I feel that regulation is needed to form and keep a checks and balances platform so that individuals and companies will be less likely to use this technology for nefarious reasons. A digital replica is not a human being and it never will be. It should not be used to replace any human workers in any industry. AI should only be used to enhance NOT replace. Thank you for reading.
