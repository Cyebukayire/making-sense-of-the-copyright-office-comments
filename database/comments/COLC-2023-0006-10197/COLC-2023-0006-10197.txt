AI does not learn like humans, and here&#39;s why this fact should violate the 4th factor on Fair Use:<br/><br/>The complexity of human learning helps in the visibility of actual artists as it encourages the creation of authentic ways to illustrate. When humans take inspiration from other artists, they also become consumers of that art. This doesn&rsquo;t harm the markets of the sources they draw inspiration from, nor does it devalue those sources. To be a successful artist, one cannot dedicate their life to imitate an artist. By playing by the same rules and utilizing human capabilities, the amount of effort put into learning from the original artist will always be more profitable if the artist creates their own unique brand and style of illustration, this is healthy for the market.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the simple and artificial learning process of AI, using adversarial systems as the generator and the discriminator, invisibilizes the sources and harms their markets even more aggressively than piracy.<br/>Piracy, at least, brings visibility to their art, creating more potential clients.<br/>AI devalues the market of the artists it absorbs and, at the same time, it is unable to evolve or create new authentic ways to illustrate because the quality of the outputs depends solely on the quality of the art used.<br/>Without new artists to absorb, AI will stagnate. It functions like a parasite.<br/><br/>Human learning is beneficial for the market because it enhances the sources of knowledge. On the other hand, AI can be detrimental to their markets. For example, someone who wants to commission an artist can simply use an AI trained on the artist&#39;s work, leading to a loss of clients for the artist. This directly undermines the artist&#39;s market, while the benefits accrue to the AI developer who exploits it.<br/><br/>This situation should be seen as a violation of the fourth factor of fair use.<br/><br/>The actual value of the industries creating generative AI depends entirely on the quality of the work of the artists. Without them, their AI is useless. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to pay for or have a license for the works they are using, as their goal is explicitly to compete against the sources in their own market.<br/><br/>This is different from other technologies like 3D, which have their own market and concept that doesn&#39;t rely on the unauthorized use of other people&#39;s works to exist. Since it has its own uniqueness, it creates its own market.<br/><br/>AI shouldn&#39;t be perceived as a human. It&#39;s more like a smoothie in a blender, where the flavor and quality of the smoothie depend on the quality of the fruits you use. You should either purchase the fruits or cultivate your own ones. Using someone else&#39;s fruits is theft, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Also, creativity is not limited to certain tools or resources. You can be creative even by using sticks on the floor. Creativity has always been accessible to everyone, so the notion of &ldquo;democratizing art&rdquo; it&rsquo;s absurd.<br/><br/>The intention is not to create art but rather to exploit the work of others for personal consumption. And yes, you can be creative in the way you exploit that work, this doesn&rsquo;t means creativity wasn&rsquo;t democratized before.<br/><br/>AI will always be constrained by the dataset it is trained on. The more you try to generate something unique, the more likely the outputs will tend towards abstraction. Once again, this behavior resembles that of a parasite.<br/><br/>Since the arrival of AI, the market for commissioned work has been devaluated to the point where artists who were used without consent to create these models have been affected by layoffs, a decrease in clients, and people being able to search for their own names on platforms like &quot;civit ai&quot;. How is this not a violation of the fourth factor on fair use? It&rsquo;s literally killing the market of the sources.<br/><br/>Also, perceiving copying other people&#39;s artworks as a secondary and unimportant step in the creation of a model is equivalent to perceiving stealing fruits from others to sell as a smoothie as a secondary and unimportant step. In reality, that &quot;secondary&quot; step is actually the most important step in ensuring the quality of their product.<br/><br/>Greetings~
