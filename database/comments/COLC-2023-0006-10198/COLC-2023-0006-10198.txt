I&#39;m a freelance artist and all I have seen with AI generators has been nothing but negative. Seeing artist work being used and put into an AI generator, agents their wishes and being used to compete with said artist. There is also an oversaturated market of computer generated images on social media and some in places were people look to hire or find artist. Such as Deviant art and artstation, which also have places in their sites filled with nothing but AI generated image. Also the fact that they are allowed in places where artist find work shows that they are being used to compete with artist.<br/><br/>You can also see example of artist competing with AI generated versions of their work on places like search engines. Like google or sites like pinterest, Example such Kelly McKernan on google an artist and If you look her up the first thing is a AI generated image that was made with her work. If someone were to see this they would think it was her work and possibly be convinced that whom ever posted it was her. <br/><br/>I will also Send some examples of people blatantly copying peoples work wit AI generators.<br/>Hopefully you can see how this contradicts Copyright.
