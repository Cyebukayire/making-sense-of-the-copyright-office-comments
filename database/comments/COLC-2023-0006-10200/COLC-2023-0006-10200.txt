Hello. I have concerns with with the AI situation. I&#39;ll keep this to points.<br/><br/>-AI trained on other peoples work (as in arts; voice; or likeness) and/or private IPs, without consent, can only be used in ideatation phase of development of a commercialized material. Any generated materials in the final production is not allowed and not protected by copywrite.<br/><br/>This is to protect the properties of other people, but allowing the leniency to use such AI for concepting. This will be similar to how image boards, many do use material not owned by the person/group, that are used in many professional settings. In addition, this will leave some opening for use of such AI for transformitive works aswell.<br/><br/>-Consent must be asked for before commercial AI can be trained on a work. If the AI was trained with out consent then generated works are not protected under copywrite.<br/><br/>Possibly having a requirement of stating if an AI was used and listing of what AI was used in a work.
