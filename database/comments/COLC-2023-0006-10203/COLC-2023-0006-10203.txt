I struggled in school and in college because of being autistic and I always loved storytelling as a way of escapism, a way to understand the world when it was difficult and as a skill I knew I was good at.<br/>But even if I was studying writing, it was still difficult and because of that I took pride in every assignment and essay that I completed while cruising my major.<br/>So I can not even begin to describe how furious I was when I saw that people were starting to praise AI as an alternative to studying to complete homework assignments and actually doing the fucking learning you&rsquo;re supposed to be paying for in college!<br/>All because of what? They were too fucking LAZY to study the text book so you give it to the machine to give you the answers?! I was accused of being lazy my whole life for something I couldn&rsquo;t help!<br/>And then those same people have the gall to say we have monopolized creativity or some other shit when they get angry at the possibility that they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to profit by scamming people with mashed up stolen parts of other people&rsquo;s hard work and passion!<br/>You know why it is that they say they should be allowed to do things like that? Because they think artists are artists because we don&rsquo;t have the brains for anything else.<br/>That kind of thinking is hurtful to anyone who has any artistic aspirations and an insult to; not only artists, but anyone who understands even a fraction of what being a human is about.<br/>Saying that human can live without art and that it can be replicated by a machine is the same as saying that humans would survive if they couldn&rsquo;t laugh.<br/>Nothing made with AI should ever be called &ldquo;art&rdquo; or copyrighted.
