Regulating AI is a conversation that will always be at the forefront of technology for years to come because AI is forever learning and teaching. So, with us being the creators and teachers of AI we need to be very strategic on how we design, develop, and position the AI system. AI is always learning and calculating great amounts of categorized training data, studying the data for patterns and correlations, and using these patterns to predict future situations. So, an overall framework will have to be put in placed to help guide AI and humans in the uncharted waters that we are entering. People&#39;s rights and people&rsquo;s safety need to be at the heart of the framework for AI.<br/>Our company Domono which is a minority owned camera designer and camera maker has AI as part of our product. With AI being part of our technology, we are always looking to be part of a solution and not the problem and to help grow and shape new technology. Cyber Security plays a major role in making sure that people are not using AI for illegal or unethical reasons.   <br/>The framework for AI needs to be set up in a way for AI to understand. This can be set up in the form of the 10 Commandments like in the Bible. This can be structured in a way that we use AI to also tell on its self when something illegal or unethical is happening and will not go against its built-in moral codes like a conscious. This system i.e. &ldquo;The Commandments&rdquo; should be structured around the following framework<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Ethical Framework<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Standards Framework<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Regulations Framework <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Legal Frameworks<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Trust Framework<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Safety Framework<br/>AI R&amp;D should be an on-going project to be used as antibodies as AI grows into adult hood. The users of AI and even nonusers need to feel a since of safety by knowing that AI have safe guards in place to protect them. Currently NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) consist of the following 5 frameworks<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Identify <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Protect <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Detect <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Respond <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Recover <br/>The National Institute of Standards and Technology outlines the framework core on its official website as a set of cybersecurity activities, desired outcomes, and applicable informative references common across critical infrastructure sectors.<br/>Inconclusion AI has its pros and cons depending on how we look at it in all honesty. AI is a baby being raised by anyone and everyone that is connected electronically and we are the mother, father and the village that is raising this baby into adult hood. So, lets raise AI the best way possible and hope that AI grows into a great asset to the world.    <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Domono Inc.<br/>
