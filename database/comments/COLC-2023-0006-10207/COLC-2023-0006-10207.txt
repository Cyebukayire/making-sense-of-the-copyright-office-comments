If it thinks, it can hold copyright. Humans are thinking machines. When an elephant makes a painting we say that the artist is the elephant. When Dall-e makes an image we say it was made using Dall-e. I&#39;ve spent $12,000 on artists and published a game with over 3000 copies sold. Most people just want to make an original character to represent themself... Most freelance artists are willing to steal intellectual property because they know that game/anime publishers appreciate free advertising. So under the precedent set by the Campbell&#39;s Soup Cans fanart, most companies let artists get away with a one-time sale on each unique artwork. I think that with the production speed of AI art, it is easy to show the creative process because someone without a graphic design background can see each step of editing process through dozens of iterations of Clarinet&#39;s Puppet Method (creating a character and refining each trait until it is your unique creation). Everyone will quantify style, character, outfit, hair, pose and lighting differently, and I think a Content ID system like youtube&#39;s will be necessary for objectivity so at least the false positives won&#39;t be biased. One of the composers I hired had to redo a soundtrack because the birdsong melody they used was copyrighted. I mean, people will find a way to monetize AI art, and there will always be a market because the quality and quantity are so high. It takes seconds to generate an image and AI art has already become extremely popular. So like, generally, I think companies should have very strict copyright rules to follow, and freelancers can do whatever. If freelance stuff gets regulated too harshly then I will just buy my art from Asia or gift money to people who release free content! I am very very very happy to see more anime waifus everywhere, and I want society to pass the point where I can find more manga than I can possibly read!
