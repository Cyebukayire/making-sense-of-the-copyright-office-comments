I am writing to express my concerns about the potential negative impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on the current patent and copyright system. While I recognize the potential benefits of AI, such as automation and efficiency, I believe that granting patents and copyrights to AI-generated works could have detrimental effects on creativity, innovation, and human authorship.<br/><br/>Arguments against granting patents and copyrights to AI<br/><br/>Lack of originality: AI models are trained on massive datasets of existing works, which raises questions about the originality of the output. Can an AI truly create something new and inventive, or is it simply recombining existing ideas? Granting patents to AI-generated inventions could stifle human innovation by discouraging individuals from pursuing research in areas where AI has already made significant progress.<br/>Uncertain authorship: Assigning authorship to AI models is problematic. Who should be considered the author of a work created by an AI? The programmer who created the AI model? The company that owns the AI technology? Or the user who interacted with the AI to generate the work? Without clear guidelines for authorship, there is a risk of diluting the value of authorship and undermining the incentive for human creativity.<br/>Unforeseen consequences: The long-term implications of granting AI legal rights are unknown. Could this lead to situations where AI-controlled entities own vast swathes of intellectual property, potentially limiting the creative freedom of humans? Additionally, how would the legal system address issues of infringement and liability when it comes to AI-generated works?<br/><br/>Instead of granting patents and copyrights to AI-generated works, I urge the US Patent and Copyright Office to consider the following:<br/><br/>Develop clear guidelines for determining originality and authorship in the context of AI. This could involve establishing criteria for assessing the level of human involvement in the creation of a work, as well as recognizing the contributions of individuals who provide training data or interact with AI systems to generate creative outputs.<br/>Invest in research and development of AI systems that promote human creativity and innovation. This could include developing AI tools that assist humans in the creative process, rather than attempting to replace them entirely.<br/>Foster open dialogue and collaboration between stakeholders in the AI, intellectual property, and creative industries. This is crucial to developing a balanced and forward-looking approach to AI that protects human authorship and encourages both technological and artistic progress.<br/>While AI offers exciting possibilities for the future, it is important to carefully consider the potential implications of granting it legal rights such as patents and copyrights. We must prioritize the protection of human creativity and innovation, and ensure that AI is used to enhance and expand human potential, not replace it.<br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Lorraine Montez<br/>Albuquerque, NM and Seattle, WA
