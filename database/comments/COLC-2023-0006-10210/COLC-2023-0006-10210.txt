I was listening to a webinar in which the speaker suggested submitting a comment here. They were talking about copyright issues and the specific idea to use watermarks to protect original works of art in video format. I am thinking that an encryption standard could be beneficial, to supplement the idea of a watermark. If there were encrypted links between an actor and a watermark, which could be an object in the video, then the watermark could be dynamic and responsive to specific things the actor does in the video. Without these traceable links between the watermark and the actor, a duplicated work of art could easily be identified as fraudulent.
