Copyright protections will cease to exist if AI is allowed to steal our hard work without consent or by forced &ldquo;consent&rdquo; at threat of losing the job. When it comes to acting it will cause millions to lose their jobs both in front and behind the camera. This will cause detrimental harm to the US economy. When it comes to modeling it is literally false advertisement and should be stopped. Again it will cause the lose of jobs on both sides of the camera. AI will also lead to an increase in mental illness as it will portray humans in ways that are unattainable. We have seen the damage photoshopping has done over the last few decades and AI will bring it to a whole new disastrous level. We need action and we need it now.
