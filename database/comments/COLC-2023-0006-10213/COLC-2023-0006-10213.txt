It needs to be absolutely illegal to monetize AI art in any form, including but not limited to, images, music, writing and film. In almost all instances, AI art takes copyrighted material for use in generating art. This legislation needs to be aggressive in it&#39;s deterrence. Restitution to artists whose work was stolen, as well as steep fines, for example $10,000 per instance of selling AI generated art.<br/><br/>We are already years behind on regulating this technology. Not only are jobs at stake already, this trend of cutting jobs to be replaced by AI will rapidly put huge numbers, likely millions of people out of work in the next few years. On top of that, targeted AI generated content directed at average citizens will only worsen the fight against disinformation. This threatens the safety of everyone. Artists are just the first big target.
