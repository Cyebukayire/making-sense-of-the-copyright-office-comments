We need legislative protections and possibly copyright protections against the unauthorized use of AI on people&rsquo;s photos and images from big tech with social media platforms using our photos already without complete transparency and consent on exactly what they do with it.<br/>There should be digital watermarks or some type of tracing of any scanned image of a person&rsquo;s likenesss image and voice that even if unrecognizable after many iterations that data should have a watermark to it to show its origin. <br/><br/>ACTORS AND ALL PERFORMERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM ABUSES BY TECH COMPANIES AND STUDIOS AND NOT BE &ldquo;COERCED&rdquo; INTO CONSENT FOR AI AS A HIRIING CONDITION. <br/><br/>WE NEED PROTECTIONS. CITIZENS, ACTORS, MODELS, EVEN IF WE ARE PAID THEY CANNOT JUST DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH OUR DATA INDEFINITELY IN PERPWTUITY. <br/>IT&rsquo;S EXPLOITIVE AND ABUSIVE. <br/><br/>Look what the streaming &ldquo;business&rdquo; model has done to the entertainment industry. Now cast and crew cannot afford health insurance. Don&rsquo;t let them replace us with AI by coercing us as a condition for employment. Please. Do something significant and expansive and as soon as possible. The technology to replace humans is already here. <br/>If no actors are needed in two years time no crew will be needed, no catering and all from stolen use of our images run away off the rails and untraceable. <br/><br/>PROTECT US, PROTECT THE ECONOMY.<br/><br/>Anything written should have a watermark as well if it&rsquo;s a from a robot to replace a writer. There have to be restrictions. <br/><br/>Thank you
