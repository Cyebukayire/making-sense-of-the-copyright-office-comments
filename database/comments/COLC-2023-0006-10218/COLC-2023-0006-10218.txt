I&#39;m a professional illustrator working in the games industry. I would like to refute some points made by AI companies.<br/><br/>First common point raised was the democratization of creativity. This is quite an absurd statement, because creativity is already democratized without AI. Pencils and paper costs next to nothing, art tutorials are free and highly accessible on Youtube, and even digital art software like Blender and Photopea can be used to make digital art for free. What isn&#39;t free are AI image generators that cost a recurring monthly subscription, like Midjourney, Dall-e and Stable Diffusion. AI companies claiming that this technology will democratize creativity would be akin to microwave oven companies claiming that microwave ovens will democratize cooking. Anyone, anywhere, at anytime, can already learn and create art with easily accessible tools and tutorials at their fingertips. AI will not democratize something that is already free and accessible, especially not with unconsented datasets, that is ironically undemocratic.<br/><br/>Second common point raised by AI companies is the fact that humans are allowed to learn from one another&#39;s works, therefore AI technology should be allowed to do so as well, because AI technology also learns from works of art like humans do.<br/>As an artist, nothing about AI training strikes me as remotely the same as what I and many others had to do to learn art. We had to read books on perspective, anatomy, color and light, etc. We had to go out and study from life, by doing life drawings, still lives, etc. Not once did I have to scrap the web for 5.85 billion images in order to learn artistic concepts.<br/>However, this whole argument is rather moot. So what if AI learns like humans? Arguing for AI to be allowed to do something, on the basis that humans are allowed to do it, is rather asinine. I do not see the need to anthropomorphize AI technology, as if it should have the same rights as a human being. No one argues that they should be able to buy a movie ticket for a video recorder, and that the video recorder should be allowed to record the movie because it is able to perceive the visible light spectrum like humans do. We as a society, explicitly banned video recording in theatres to protect the work of film makers. I do not see any reason to not treat AI the same, since it is also a piece of technology. I do not understand AI companies feeling the need to treat AI as if it has human rights. It does not and it should not have human rights. If AI companies want their tech to be able to be trained on unconsented data, they need to come up with a better reason than &quot;humans can do it, so can AI&quot;. Whatever regulations are conceived around AI technology, it should always be to the benefit of human beings, not to the benefit of AI.<br/><br/>Lastly, AI datasets should be opt-in only. It is atrocious that AI companies think that opt-out is fair, especially when most datasets are not public. This goes against the very fundamental principle of consent. Please, I urge the USCO to stand by the side of artists and creatives, on the side of humans and not AI.
