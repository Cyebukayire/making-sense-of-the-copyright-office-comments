As an aspiring artist and consumer of art, I am not impressed by any of these generative AI systems (midjourney, ChatGPT, etc.) The creative industry is a hard one to get into on it&#39;s own; why must we compete with machines that have access to every post, movie, comment that has ever been released? This is not art, this is simply copying and pasting. I know many argue that a human does the same thing. We draw inspiration and make art, how is a computer different? The difference is human&#39;s have to study why the things they love are so good. They have to spend hours researching, creating, failing and restarting before they present to you a finished product. The process is so important, but corporations only want a product. They only want the money to fall right into their lap. Rather than hiring more artists (because believe me, if we just hired more artists to do things, we wouldn&#39;t need shortcuts), generative AI intends to replace them. <br/><br/>If people want to use generative AI, they should have limitations. They should not be able to use people&#39;s likeness, and they should not have access to everything that&#39;s ever been created. Instead, they should create a source library in which all of their generative AI is limited to what is inside the library.  And everything that&#39;s been made with generative AI should disclose just that. Even if it&#39;s just in the brainstorming process. Why? Well, consumers should be able to decide whether they want to consume work that uses generative AI or not. If people are so happy to use these programs, then they should have no problem disclosing how and when they&#39;ve used it. It is not okay to train generative AI on the hardwork of other creators. Not only is published work at risk, but now writers fear that their Google and Word docs are being used to train AI. <br/><br/>In an ideal world, things like Midjourney and ChatGPT would not exist. I don&#39;t believe they should. People say that we should always strive for progress- but what are we progressing to? What is the end goal here, aside from algorithms creating souless work that is cheaper for corporations? I know AI has it&#39;s place in this world, but it has no place in creative fields. Art gives so may people meaning, and I&#39;d hate to see the death of human art because people failed to see how valuable it truly is. I feel nothing for an algorithm that curates an amalgamation of stolen work.
