In order for something to be copyrighted, it should have to be actually written, drawn, or otherwise produced by a human hand. AI does not create anything. Human beings DO. AI works by scraping (sometimes illegally) the art made by actual human beings and generates a product based on stolen information. Generating is not the same as creating something with your own hands. AI writing or art cannot be allowed to be copyrighted.
