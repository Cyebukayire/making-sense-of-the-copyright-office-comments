Humans can make art, tell stories, and compose music anytime, anywhere, by any means in the simple but ever-important act of creation. A person&#39;s consumption of media or viewing/listening/reading of art is not a requirement to create. Not only is it a computer creating AI &quot;art&quot; - not the human - but its function to generate necessarily requires massive quantities of stolen data. Data that was not shared to be trained on, that is not attributed to the original creator, that is being used to actively plagiarize intellectual properties. Do not let AI automate the single most human thing there is.
