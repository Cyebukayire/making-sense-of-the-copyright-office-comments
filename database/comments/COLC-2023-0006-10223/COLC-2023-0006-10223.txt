As an actor, I am terrified about what the future holds for my industry with AI. I don&rsquo;t want to be replaced, and I don&rsquo;t want my intellectual property, my digitial replica, or ANYTHING of mine being owned by studios. To then train and make it easier for them to replace us all in the near future with AI performers. I am desperately pleading for intervention, in order to protect us from the growing concern of rapid AI tech advances.
