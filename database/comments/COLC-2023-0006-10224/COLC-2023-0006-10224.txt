To the Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am contacting you in reference the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Study currently underway. As a fiction writer, I have strong feelings regarding the intellectual property rights of the creative community, and I implore you to NOT ALLOW the use of copyrighted books in AI Training without the explicit permission of the author.<br/><br/>I am not an admirer of the changes inflicted on society by large for-profit tech corporations and their polarizing Social Media algorithms. No one knows what is real or who to believe anymore, and there seems to be an ever present decline in humanity brought about by the relentless greed of those entities. And I only see AI accelerating that loss of authentic human interaction and human warmth within society.<br/><br/>As an individual, I would hope that it would be my right to NOT contribute to the AI revolution. All I care about is authentic human experience, and what originates from a real human heart. And as an artist, it should be my right NOT to participate in what I consider a further erosion of society.<br/><br/>Please recommend that the term &ldquo;All rights reserved.&rdquo; is inclusive of the right of an individual in the creative/artistic community to control whether his or her work can be used in AI Training.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>
