Generative AI violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>TechNet claims they relied on case law that &ldquo;intermediate copying&rdquo; of works as part of a process to create new works was &ldquo;transformative&rdquo; fair use. <br/><br/>Section 107 of the Copyright Act states that fair use reproduction should be only for &ldquo;criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research&rdquo;. The generative AI tools used by Big Tech clearly do not fall into any of these categories. <br/><br/>Furthermore, generative AI violates the Copyright Act in more ways than it complies. <br/><br/>The first violation is &quot;use of a commercial nature&quot;. Most companies charge for use of their generative AI software (Midjourney, Chat GPT Plus, Adobe Firefly, Dalle-2). <br/><br/>The next violation is &quot;the effect of the use upon the potential market&quot;. â€¨<br/> Google stated in their comments to the Copyright office that &lsquo;Using the tool to create new visual works to compete in the market is not the kind of market harm relevant to fair use&rsquo;. TechNet also commented &ldquo;That the technology enables the creation of new works that might compete with the works of today&rsquo;s artists is not a reason to distort copyright into a tool for protectionism.&rdquo; <br/><br/> However, despite these claims, the most prolific use of generative AI seems to be impersonation. For this, you have only to look into websites such as CivitAI or tools like LoRA Models, where users build generative AI models to explicitly imitate specific artists (Greg Rutkowski, SamDoesArts, etc) by name using their work. <br/><br/>Midjourney CEO David Holz even told the software&rsquo;s users through discord messages &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re all gonna get [your] mind blown by this style feature &hellip; i should be clear it&rsquo;s not just genres its also artist names &hellip; it&rsquo;s mostly artist names &hellip; 4000 artist names.&rdquo; <br/><br/>TechNet argues &ldquo;AI developers shouldn&rsquo;t be liable for users&rsquo; wrongdoings because doing so makes no more sense that imposing liability on the creator of a word processor simply because someone used it to draft a work of fiction that infringes on a copyrighted book.&rdquo; Unlike a word processor, though, these AI base models rely heavily on copyright work that is already in their dataset before a user even alters it. An example of this is Disney&rsquo;s recent demand to pull its trademarks from Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing AI, which was being used to create &quot;offensive AI Pixar&quot; images that looked real. <br/><br/>As for consideration of &quot;the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole&quot;, it should be noted that most generative AI products rely entirely on copyright work, either in a base dataset or through fine-tuning. These &quot;tools&quot; and products would not exist without the works &quot;scraped&quot; and stolen from artists, photographers, writers, etc. wholly in order to create their base datasets. It does not matter how &quot;transformative&quot; the output its users &quot;create&quot; may be - the creation of the generative software itself is infringement. We should be judging the &quot;Fair Use&quot; of the product itself before its outputs. <br/><br/>The argument &quot;it learns just like a human&quot; that nearly all of these generative AI companies make is, again, plainly false. The software cannot generate output, or &quot;learn&quot; without inputs that have been stolen or taken without explicit consent from the original sources.&nbsp; Generative AI is, once more, software that was built upon and relies solely on infringement at a massive scale. <br/><br/>Finally, I would like to address Stability AI&rsquo;s argument that they allow artists to &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; of datasets. First, it is nearly impossible for these generative AI algorithms to &quot;unlearn&quot; the copyright or unlicensed data that has been used to &quot;train&quot; them. Second, it is the responsibility of generative AI companies to make sure their data is compliant, not the community. Having clearly regulated datasets in general will benefit everyone in the future.<br/><br/>The information shared here demonstrates clear violation of the Copyright Act, and that the &quot;Fair Use&quot; argument presented by generative AI companies is unequivocally false. If allowed to continue in an unregulated manner, there will be no way for artists, photographers, writers, etc. that have had their works &quot;scraped&quot; and stolen to compete in the market, and no incentive for anyone to create future original works.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>
