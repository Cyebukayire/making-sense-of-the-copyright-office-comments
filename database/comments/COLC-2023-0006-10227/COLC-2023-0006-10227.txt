In short, AI created art of any kind should not be granted copyright protection. This is because the algorithms are not creating anything new; they are merely mimicking and re-creating other pieces of art fed into the bots by way of machine learning. In short, this is a copyright disaster that will only lead to abuse of the system. All AI developers should be required to seek permission to train their systems with copyrighted work in order to prevent more legal headaches than what AI already presents. If artificial intelligence is not regulated early on at every level -- including restricting copyright protections -- then it will only create the need for legislation in a &quot;too late&quot; scenario when the integrity of the US copyright is a thing of the past.
