As a professional animator and artist for over 20 years, the advent of large language and image models has been frightening and extremely frustrating. Regulation is desperately needed across web and cloud platforms, but especially when it comes to the gathering, storing, and manipulating of data, both written and visual by corporations and service providers.<br/><br/>AI Image generation is theft. The models, which are not actually artificial intelligence at all, illegally gather, sort, and reproduce the labor of countless workers for profit. Time and time again it has been demonstrated that you can dissect their products to find the artist and images held and reproduced in their databases. This is irrevocable proof that copyright violations and outright theft has occurred. At every step, instead of relenting, they have attempted to improve their ability to hide this truth instead. These large databases should be permanently shut down, and all these &quot;large language models&quot; should be prohibited from existing if there is any possibility of them being used for profit. This isn&#39;t some altruistic endeavour, or an academic experiment, this technology is being used expressly to exploit and elminate human labor and artistry, and position themselves, the technocrats and sycophants, as the sole provider and holder of the production of entire mediums of artistic and human expression. Any subterfuge of science, research, or providing a service to the disabled is just that, a lie to buy more time, to better perfect their theft and obfuscate the truth.<br/><br/>Shut them down. All of them.
