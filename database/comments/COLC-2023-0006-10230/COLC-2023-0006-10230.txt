It is plagiarism when you don&rsquo;t cite your sources. It is plagiarism if you copy and paste text, even if you replace some of the words. People who use AI to create visual art don&rsquo;t disclose whose art the AI is taking from. And when people train AI on work, they do not ask permission to do so. If I type a question into a Google search engine, I don&rsquo;t own the results just because I came up with the question. The same goes for people typing in prompts into generative ai systems. You do not own the outcomes. And a lot of the time, the work that is being used to create the outcome &mdash; the artist did not give consent for their work to be used.<br/><br/>Artists use online platforms to share their work. But sharing your work is not the same as consenting to your work being used to train AI. The fear of stolen work discourages small artists from sharing their comics, illustrations, animations, writing, and more.<br/><br/>People disclose when their art is photography, traditional, collage, digital, sculpture and so on. The use of generative AI should always be disclosed. It doesn&rsquo;t matter when or how it was used &mdash; it should always be disclosed. That way people like me, who believe generative AI shouldn&rsquo;t exist, can avoid it. If people are so amazed by this tech, their is no reason to pretend that they didn&rsquo;t use it.<br/><br/> How can we prove whether AI was used or not? That is something that I don&rsquo;t have the answer for.
