Please do not let AI use artists&#39; work. It is an extremely slippery slope, not just ethically, but practically. Artists already have such a difficult time finding paid work, and the use of AI in this manner will only accelerate our destitution. This is will ultimately hurt the country economically, socially, and culturally. Even if an artist wishes to consent, this will not only affect that one artist, but other artists as well, until we&#39;re rendered obsolete.
