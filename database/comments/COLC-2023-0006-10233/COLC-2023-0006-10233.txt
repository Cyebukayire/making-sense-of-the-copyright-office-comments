I am a professional artist and I would like to present my comments and expectations. I welcomed artificial intelligence-based artistic tools and immediately incorporated them into my creative process. This is a real technological breakthrough that will influence the world of art at least as strongly as the appearance of photography in the 19th century and computer graphics in the 20th century. Like those changes, the appearance of image generators aroused fear in some artists and stimulated them to protest, not necessarily rationally. But the essence of art is change.<br/><br/>I am concerned about the idea of creating separate rights for users of image generators and I believe that it would ultimately do more harm than good to the creators. The current recommendation to not copyright AI images and treat them as works in the public domain is already problematic. On the one hand, we have endless amounts of &quot;nobody&#39;s works&quot; (which, with the development of technology, look better and better), on the other hand, we encounter difficulties in commercial applications. However, AI is not only about image generators, elements of artificial intelligence can also be found in classic graphics software; (e.g. intelligent fill tools, some filters, the operation of various types of &quot;brushes&quot;) sometimes the user does not even know whether the tool he has selected from the application toolbox uses artificial intelligence or not. This trend will only intensify and I think that in the near future it will be difficult to find graphical applications without artificial intelligence elements. We need standardization of rules for the use of new technology, not separate laws.<br/><br/>After all, there is no such thing as &quot;AI art&quot;, there is only the art of a HUMAN using AI tools.<br/><br/>The criteria that, according to the Office&#39;s recommendations, are to define human contribution also raise my doubts. First of all, they are archaic and ignore the last hundred years of art history. For over a century, a work of art has no longer been defined by the artist&#39;s skill in the craftsmanship, the number of hours devoted to work, or even the handcrafting of the object. Today, creators can automate many elements of their work or even outsource the implementation of their vision to subcontractors. Full control over the process of creating a work of art is also not important; many contemporary artists use chance or randomness here.<br/>So what counts? Contemporary art indicates two decisive things: the idea of the artist who initiates the creative process and the artist&#39;s decision as to which of the effects of his action should be considered a finished work. And that&#39;s it, the rest is technical.<br/>Using image generators fully meets these assumptions.<br/>So what is the problem?<br/>Probably only in the fact that the image generator is a tool that is orders of magnitude more effective than a brush, a camera or a graphics program. However, this is not a qualitative difference but only a quantitative one.<br/><br/>So I propose to consider image generators only as another artistic tool. There is no need to anthropomorphize artificial intelligence, create a cumbersome category of works of art, or create separate regulations. It is a powerful tool, but still just a tool.<br/>Of course, with great power comes great responsibility. Exactly as in the case of works created using a photography brush or a computer program - it is up to the user how to use a given tool. The user bears full responsibility. Current copyright law defines it this way.<br/><br/>A separate issue is the business and economic model of functioning on the AI tools market. This is what the real game is about right now because there is a lot of money at stake. What should win &ndash; free open source software or paid and closed co-corporate models?<br/><br/>As a user and artist, I would like to work with a tool that is as versatile, flexible and customizable as possible. I would not like it to be available only as a paid web application, I would prefer it to be possible to install it locally on a home computer. Therefore, ideal for me would be open AI models, made available as open source software, able to be modified and adapted to the creator&#39;s style. Closed, paid corporate models trained on limited and licensed data sets do not meet my expectations. Such a tool will not democratize art and will only contribute to increasing the possibilities and potential of strong and wealthy entities, while increasing the distance between them and independent artists and small companies.<br/>I am also not satisfied with &quot;safe&quot; tools that have artificially limited capabilities and are censored. There are also concerns about how confidential web applications will be and whether their use is safe for our privacy. Doesn&#39;t this model of operation inevitably involve old tunes - user surveillance and constantly rising subscription prices?<br/><br/>To sum up - let&#39;s leave artists the freedom to choose the tool of creative expression.
