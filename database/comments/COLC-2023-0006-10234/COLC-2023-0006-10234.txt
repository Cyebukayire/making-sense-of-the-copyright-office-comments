The discussion raises the question of whether and how artists whose works the AI was trained on should be remunerated. The problem here is broader and talking only about works of art and artists is not entirely... ethical. They say they make up 1% of all data on which AI is trained, so why aren&#39;t we also talking about the other 99%? The discussion should be about the big picture and asking whether publicly available data can be used to teach AI or not. This, of course, takes the discussion to the next level. Would it be possible and necessary to license EVERYTHING we put on the Internet? Theoretically, yes, because someone can make money on each of our photos, paintings and drawings that some artificial intelligence &quot;sees&quot;, just like on the analysis of all our activities on the Internet - purchases, discussions, history of visited websites... This means that either they should be ALL Internet users are rewarded in some way, or on the contrary - no one.<br/>The discussion about the ethics of the tool and remuneration exclusively for artists seems to be instrumentally used to promote &quot;ethical&quot; corporate closed and paid AI models.
