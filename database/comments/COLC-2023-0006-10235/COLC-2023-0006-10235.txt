Being a writer, plagiarism is already something I have experienced multiple times. However, most of the time, it&#39;s deliberate, and it&#39;s hard to stop those that are doing deliberately. But if my writing were to be scraped and put into AI without my consent, then it would constantly be plagiarized whenever that AI starts writing something. I&#39;d have no way of knowing, and no way of stopping it. Considering I&#39;m only a college student, my income sources are already very few. If AI steals my work without any sort of compensation, can you imagine how much littler my already microscopic income will become?
