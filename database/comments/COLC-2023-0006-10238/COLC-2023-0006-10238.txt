AI &quot;Art&quot; is theft, and should be prosecuted like any other crime. It is the theft of work and wages from creatives, who have spent generations being exploited by the creatively bankrupt and the money-obsessed for profit margins and ego stoking.<br/><br/>The software being utilized to commit these crimes is &quot;trained&quot; on existing work by artists online, typically without the consent or even awareness of those artists, and the corporations and individuals utilizing that software believe themselves above moral or legal repercussions for their actions, as is their tradition. Apple, for example, argues that &quot;if a human is in control&quot; of the software&#39;s output, that that in of itself is sufficient grounds for copywriting the results of their theft, an argument that is both ridiculous and astounding in its audacity. <br/><br/>The very concept of copywriting the results of &quot;generative&quot; AI is asinine, an insult. <br/><br/>Apple further notes that they have been using automated tools to assist in computer development for decades, perhaps all well and good, but if these tools and their results were entirely-in house, then that is no support of the argument in favor of tools that rely on &quot;training sets&quot; taken from the open internet. Using an AI tool to generate something for yourself from your own work is one matter, and that is the &quot;in&quot; Apple is attempting to use to justify copywriting AI &quot;content&quot;. But they cannot prove that that is what they are going to do, because so many people have already failed to limit themselves in this way.<br/><br/>Apple proceeds to further discuss coding, specific issues in that process and the applications of AI for that process. They make a distinction between &quot;suggested code&quot; spat out by the AI and &quot;developed code&quot; reworked by a human overseer into a usable state- and more pertinent to their argument, a state in which it could be copyrighted. A sound point in theory, but it still hinges on the armor-piercing question: Where did the AI obtain the information it needed to generate that initial code? Entirely from Apple&#39;s own databases? Can they even prove that? And can you trust any given party to be able to prove the same?<br/><br/>And returning to the discussion of AI art, can you trust the product of any generative AI software to be 100% original? The answer is no. These algorithms lack the spark of human creativity. They cannot create something wholly original, unique, or, i many cases, believable as art, given their predilection for adding extra fingers to hands and other such errors. They can only take what they have already seen, blend it together and regurgitate a pale imitation and summation of that information. <br/><br/>Microsoft makes lofty promises about &quot;generative&quot; AI and its importance to technological development, and dares to compare the worries of artists, musicians today to the handwringing of yesteryear about previously new technologies: the printing press, the camera, the internet. They rattle off a long list of ways that this technology could conceivably be used to benefit humanity, predicated on the utter farce that Apple, Microsoft, or any corporation, much less an amoral data-harvesting syndicate like Palantir Technologies, would use theses tools in any beneficial capacity for the masses.<br/><br/>If AI tools are to have any beneficial capacity in practice, they must be heavy regulated and monitored, and given the increasingly corrupt and authoritarian nature of American government, this is an unlikely scenario in any instance except where it could be used to further erode freedoms, artificially alter public opinions, and reinforce the positions of the corporations and their henchmen.<br/><br/>It is the recommendation of this commenter that nothing spat out by generative AI should be copyrighted, in the interest of protecting small developers and creatives.
