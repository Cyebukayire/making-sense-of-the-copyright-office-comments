Many underestimate the cultural role that intellectual property continues to serve in modern society.  I can state without hyperbole -- it is critical for the survival of society as we are now accustomed.<br/><br/>The protections to intellectual properties afforded by copyright, patents, and trademarks offer society the ability to invest in thoughts and to advance technology through innovation.<br/><br/>It is, therefore, critical to preserve the sanctity of these protections and not endorse processes designed to weaken through obfuscation or manipulation.  To prevent protection for processes based entirely upon reuse of currently protected works without consent.<br/><br/>Currently, all computationally synthesized media (e.g., Synthart, Synthography, Synth-lit, etc.) are composed entirely through the mathematical derivation of previously existing works.  A vast majority of works included in these archives actively possess a copyright protected status and have been dissected and used without consent.<br/><br/>Indeed, copies of these unauthorized images and literature are foundational to the function and operation of synthesized workflows.  In fact, without these in-memory, categorized, or searchable mathematical representations of preexisting copyright protected works, synthesized outputs could not exist.  Further, these works that have been synthesized from copyright protected works are intended to complete directly with those currently protected works.<br/><br/>I further posit that if just a single preexisting image or literary work were provided as its entire &#39;training set&#39;, then obvious derivative work would be the only possible outcome.  Moreover, the further violation through additional images or literary works must only serve to compound the harm and damages, not to provide a plausible route of defense, escape, or protection.<br/><br/>It is with this in mind that only mechanically or electronically derivative work is possible through these workflows, and copyright protected status should not be granted to works produced solely through this process.  This is especially true, where all the creators of all original works fed into these workflows have not been properly identified and where express consent was not granted, when possible.<br/><br/>I leave open the possibility of a future where consent is again foremost in consideration of mechanical compositions.  Where new thoughts and inspirations can coexist with adequate protection of prior creativity.<br/><br/>Until such time, the priority must be laser focused toward protection and consent of already protected works.  For without protection and consent, the concept of intellectual property is forfeit in its entirety.
