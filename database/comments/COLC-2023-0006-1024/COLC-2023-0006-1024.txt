While I would much prefer an unconditional ban of generative AI, I can see it being of some use as a necessary evil in helping the industry. But I think like this on each.<br/><br/>(Voice) Under reasonable conditions, Voice Actors and similar performers could use generative AI to help studios with their roles on the condition the Voice Actor is allowed to come in and redub the lines. But given the current atmosphere, I feel like using generative AI for voice acting is simply too risky.<br/><br/>(Art and Music) In this case, my mind is honestly far less kind; generative AI here basically is just some assholes who want to demonize the artistic community on both fronts. IF generative AI were used positively, it&#39;d be in helping out at forming an idea and getting said idea off the ground, but should go no further in either front.<br/><br/>(Writing) This is probably the only part where generative AI pushes into a slippery slope; It can do some good in helping draft ideas to create characters for stories in media and stuff, but if you&#39;re working at that point, people may be like &#39;why not just use AI to write the whole story?&#39; which makes it dangerous.<br/><br/>All in all, I think on your final rule for AI, I think you guys made the right call; AI generated works should be barred from copyright of any kind if that&#39;s all it is. If people aren&#39;t willing to put in the effort to make something more from an AI generated base, then they shouldn&#39;t be able to copyright it. Otherwise you&#39;re risking the loss of multiple industries becoming moot due to the whole thing becoming dime a dozen, and people involved in those professions would effectively be homeless as the media industry would collapse worldwide.
