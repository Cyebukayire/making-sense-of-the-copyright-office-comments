I am very concerned about AI.  Actors need to be able to retain their image!  Our image cannot be ripped off.  Acting is a creative field and a craft for live actors.  We need to be protected.  Our writing is protected.  Our images need to be protected. I do not want my image scanned and used.  I don&#39;t want my image to undergo changes and become a synthetic image.
