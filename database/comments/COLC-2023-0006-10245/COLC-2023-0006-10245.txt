<br/>If the Library of Congress permits people to file copyright for LLM-generated text or images, the next move might as well be to allow anyone to file copyright for a query they type into a search engine. Which is to say, there is no reasonable argument that such a thing is a creative work. Key words, even complex arrays of keywords meant to evoke a specific response, are not creative work any more than tables or charts or map data would be. We cannot even argue at this time that these programs are sentient or capable of understanding what they generate; any claims that intelligent AI are imminent seem misguided. <br/><br/>As a result, the only creative, human-made material you find in an LLM like OpenAI is the pirated work that these companies used in their training datasets&mdash; the resulting products of which have then been presented as a reasonable way to avoid paying living writers and artists for their original work. I have yet to see a situation where using a complete, copyrighted work for commercial purposes would be considered a justifiable &ldquo;fair use.&rdquo;<br/><br/>As it stands in the US, the full benefits of copyright protection are only meaningfully available to those who can afford the filing fees and lawsuits. Our partial adoption of the Berne Conventions means that many people cannot gain the benefit of the full effects of copyright upon the creation of their artwork. Corporations often use that leverage to squash lawsuits by independent artists trying to protect their work from obvious theft. While copyright is supposedly equal opportunity, in practice corporations have much more sway to protect their copyrights or violate others&rsquo;.  Allowing companies developing LLMs to get away with this sheer volume of theft would simply be another indication that artists have very little meaningful recourse to protect their original work. I hope the Library of Congress will do better. <br/><br/>
