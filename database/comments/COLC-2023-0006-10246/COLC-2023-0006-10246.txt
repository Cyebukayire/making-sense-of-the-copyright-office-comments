A jazz band that improvises a song based on copyrighted melodies is producing something new, but it is done with awareness of the original author. Copyright law should protect this awareness from users of AI tools who lost contact with their source material or training data. When a product is made by a community that has lost awareness of the sources of its materials, it is no longer a human creation and should be called an AI product that will be deprived of its copyright until the authors have acknowledged their sources or restricted themselves to copying sequences that do not exceed the capabilities of human working memory.<br/><br/>I am a US citizen and ex-physicist who is not affiliated with any software, entertainment, or publishing company and I wrote a novel in 2016-2017 called My Adorable Apotheosis that was used within the training data of some popular AI writing tools without any form of notification or permission. I took data on hundreds of novels and movies to quantify the scope of the problem. Please see the attached pdf for details.
