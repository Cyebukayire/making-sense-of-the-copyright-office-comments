We welcome the chance to respond to this important request for information from the United States Copyright Office (USCO). Frontiers is a leading research publisher and open science platform, the third most cited and sixth largest in the world. The science we publish is peer-reviewed, globally shared, and free to read.<br/><br/>Our position is three-fold:<br/><br/>First, as a business whose driving purpose is to support the scientists who wish to publish their research with us, we back the principle of author attribution. We think applying attribution to AI and LLM outputs &ndash; and doing so in a way that is easily accessible to both end user and rights holder &ndash; is both ethically and commercially compelling, notwithstanding that the cost and regulatory implications have yet to be fully understood. <br/><br/>Second, it can easily be argued that the better the AI and LLM inputs &ndash; defined here as scientifically accurate, validated, verified, peer reviewed, and tested by public opinion &ndash; the better will be the outputs. We would encourage the USCO to consider how scientific publishers might provide more inputs to train AI and LLMs.<br/><br/>And third, in that context, we think the opportunity for better quality AI and LLM inputs is being squandered by a legacy scientific publishing system that locks scientific knowledge behind paywalls.<br/><br/>The points above are expanded upon, and additional points are made, in the attached full reply. We think the USCO has posed critical questions in this request for information about the opportunities, challenges, risks, and benefits of AI. General, human-compatible AI could empower us all, but public trust in good science will be key.
