As an artist and a writer, personally I&#39;m rather against the concept of people copyrighting things they made using AI technology. I can understand copyrighting the AI itself, though I&#39;d suppose that would make anything it produced under that copyright as well, right? But as an artist, I would never want my own or anyone else&#39;s hard work shoved into a computer program without consent only for whoever put it in there to claim any images/writing the AI spat out using other&#39;s work. Aside from the obvious lack of effort on the AI user&#39;s part, it&#39;s like a punch in the gut for your work to be used in ways you never intended it or allowed it to be used for.
