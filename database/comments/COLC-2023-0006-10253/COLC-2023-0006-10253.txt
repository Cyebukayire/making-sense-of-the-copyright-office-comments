Thank you for giving the public an opportunity to comment on this Artificial Intelligence Study. Below, I&rsquo;ve answered the four main questions posed by the notice&mdash;<br/><br/>   (1) the use of copyrighted works to train AI models<br/><br/>I strongly believe that the use of copyrighted works to train AI models is unfair competition, removes rights from copyright holders, and does not fall under fair use. <br/><br/>The Fair Use doctrine mentions the &ldquo;effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp;Generative AI like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are (currently) entirely dependent on copyrighted works to function, cannot use AI-made training data without model collapse, and are specifically made, advertised, and used as a replacement for creatives. They do not advertise themselves as a tool for illustrators, actors, or other creatives, and instead advertise how cheap and easy it is to generate image or sound assets. They want to corner the entire market, make creatives unemployable, and become a monopoly. <br/><br/>Because many current Generative AI models dependent on copyrighted works that aren&rsquo;t properly licensed (and are trying to replace the very people and companies whose artwork they unlawfully used) it cannot be considered fair use. <br/><br/>(2) the copyrightability of material generated using AI systems<br/><br/>Let&rsquo;s say I go to a restaurant, and I order a hamburger without pickles.&nbsp;I keep sending it back until the restaurant gets it just right. Just because I had a special request, it doesn&rsquo;t make me a chef. I didn&rsquo;t make that hamburger.  <br/><br/>There is currently no way to accurately predict results in an algorithm &mdash; many prompts have to be made until the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; one is found. In its current form, AI algorithms are more similar to a slot machine than an actual tool. <br/><br/>(3) potential liability for infringing works generated using AI systems;<br/><br/>If a work is found to be infringing, I think the liability should be entirely on the company who owns the AI algorithm. They made the models available to the public and should hold 100% of the responsibility.  <br/><br/> (4) the treatment of generative AI outputs that imitate the identity or style of human artists. <br/><br/> It is 100% possible to build an ethical, non-infringing AI &mdash; in fact, Stable Diffusion licensed a dataset from Stable Audio to make its generative AI music algorithm. Why did they not do this with their generative art algorithm? <br/><br/>I think the only adequate way to address this is Algorithmic Destruction &mdash;&nbsp;there is precedent for this when data was illegally collected (Cambridge Analytica, Everalbum, WW International/Kurbo, etc), and it&rsquo;s the only fair way to ensure that copyrighted and trademarked material stays out of training data. Companies should be forced to retrain their algorithms in a way that does not infringe on millions of copyright owners.     <br/><br/>In conclusion, I am deeply concerned about the future of the entertainment industry. <br/><br/>I have worked as an illustrator professionally for 13 years, and I have never faced as much difficulty getting work as I have now. Humans are the reason why the US entertainment industry has lead the world for a century, and without human creativity we will lose everything we have worked so hard for as a culture &mdash; every country on earth is familiar with US customs and traditions, mostly because of how wide-reaching our movies, games, and entertainment are. If Americans continue to choose other careers and not to become creatives, an entire multi-billion dollar industry could collapse. America will become irrelevant on the world stage.<br/><br/>Copyright should encourage us to create, and give me and other creatives the authorization to protect and exclusively reproduce our work.   Currently, I feel like the US Government isn&rsquo;t doing enough to protect my rights. If I make something and post it online, it will simply be stolen by generative AI companies and used to fine-tune their models. Why should I even bother?<br/><br/>   I hope the US Copyright Office considers the future of Copyright, and protects creatives from companies that seek to hide under the guise of Fair Use. AI should not receive the same consideration for copyright as a flesh-and-blood human.
