Generative AI is built on copyrighted works of people who did not give their consent and neither were compensated. This technology would not be as good as it is now without the use of those works. Meanwhile, the developers of this technology and their companies keep making profit out of millions of people&#39;s labor which they (the developers) don&#39;t own. Furthermore, this technology create an environment of unfair competition for the creative working class across the United States and the whole world.<br/><br/>Visual artists, photographers, musicians, actors and all kind of creative workers need protection against those unfair practices. Consent, credit, compensation and transparency are key to regulate these technologies.<br/><br/>As a concept art and graphic design student from Spain, I have always admired all the magnificent art that American artists can produce. From films, to videogames, to comics, to music and books. Since I was a kid I have been delighted and inspired by all that work made in America. And that outstanding art wouldn&#39;t have existed without the work of human artists and production workers over the years.
