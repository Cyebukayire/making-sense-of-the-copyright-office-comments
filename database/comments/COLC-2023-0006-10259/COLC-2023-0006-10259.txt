As someone who has studied copyright law due to its impact on the industry that I work in, as well as having professional experience with machine learning (colloquially &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;), it is my understanding that with current laws copyright is only applied to things involving the spark of human creativity. As technology does not have anything approaching sentience, it lacks creativity, and even if it did it would not be considered human (akin to animal created works not being granted copyright). The only thing that may have copyright applied is the information fed into the software, such as a text prompt or audio/video reference, as that was the portion that had human involvement.<br/><br/>In addition, most generative AI large language models work on the premise of taking related data from its training set and combining it, effectively making a collage. Many of the large language models are trained using publicly viewable, but copyrighted content.Making a new image based on copyrighted works does not eliminate the copyright claim of the &quot;parent&quot; content, just the same as a person making a remix does not have a result that is without other claims. <br/><br/>It is my belief that AI generated works should not be granted copyright due to lack of human involvement and creativity, and can actually be examples of intellectual property violations. The only people who want AI content to be copyright eligible are those who seek to benefit from the work of others.
