I urge you all to protect human made art and not weaken copyrights just to cater to big tech and Generative AI. We should not give these big tech companies the power to monopolize art by incentivizing a rapid release of passionless content. I don&#39;t see a market for these AI generated works because people won&rsquo;t want to waste their limited time and hard-earned money on something they don&#39;t think would be enjoyable.<br/><br/>Take this example, superhero movies of recent times have been struggling box office and ratings wise, and while yes I do realize that these movies are made by humans I believe this analogy still works. These are movies that belong to a genre that just a few years ago was pumping out hit after hit with some of them even being some of the highest-grossing movies of all time. That&rsquo;s not to say that superhero movies are not popular anymore, movies like Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and Spiderman Across the Spider-Verse were both well received. On top of all that, it recently came out that 2023 was the first year since 2014 that Disney failed to have a movie make 1 billion dollars. The point I&rsquo;m trying to make is that just because new movies exist, doesn&rsquo;t mean people are going to watch them or even be interested in them. I only see Generative AI exacerbating this problem by adding more and more generic, passionless content to an ever increasing pile, whilst lowering the chances of actual passionate and interesting works being created.<br/><br/>The only reason that artists, lawyers, programmers, etc. are being replaced is because these are the only careers that can be replaced. Once companies have the means to replace more &lsquo;physical jobs&rsquo; they will, and that in my opinion is one of the biggest problems of AI. People have to work to get paid, and if they can&rsquo;t work then they don&rsquo;t get paid, and if they don&rsquo;t get paid then they can&rsquo;t/ won&rsquo;t be able to spend any money. I don&rsquo;t believe that most people, who lost their jobs to AI, would even want to watch an AI generated movie.<br/><br/> For all we know we might be in an AI bubble and while there are good applications of AI, like in the medical field, there&#39;s also a lot of bad that can come from AI. Things like scams, the internet becoming unusable, to deepfakes. I don&rsquo;t think AI should be seen as the end or a replacement for humans, and I especially don&rsquo;t think AI should be seen as a toy. Instead, I think AI should be seen only as a tool to help humans.
