Musings on adapting and applying existing copyright concepts to components and processes of Generative AI Systems.<br/><br/>Definitions<br/>Data owner: An entity that owns data that was included in a dataset<br/>Collector: An entity that collects data into a dataset. Collectors are often also trainers.<br/>Trainer: An entity that trains a generative AI model, uses a dataset for the training<br/>Trained Model: One or more machine learning structures (ie neural networks) that were modified (ie weights changed) to incorporate aspects of a dataset via training algorithm(s). <br/>Generative AI System: A computing system incorporating a Trained Model with a facility for end-users to supply prompts and receive inferences from the Trained Model.<br/>Model end-user: An entity that uses the trained model to make inferences.<br/>Prompts: The input(s) that a Generative AI System needs in order to make an inference.  If a prompts are owned by the user unless they give their rights to another entity.<br/><br/>Concepts<br/>Datasets should be treated as &lsquo;collective works&rsquo; by default unless the authors of the data have given explicit permission to the training entity to collect their work into such a set.<br/><br/>Data set classification<br/>Appropriated dataset: a data set containing at least 1 input data where the owner of the data did not give permission for it to be included in the dataset <br/>Permissive dataset: a data set containing only data which the owner gave the following transferable permissions to the collector 1) to include the data in a data set, 2) use the data for training models, 3) relinquishes any claim of ownership to model outputs<br/><br/>The Trained Model is a &lsquo;derivative work&rsquo; of the dataset and training algorithm(s)<br/><br/>Applying the concepts<br/>Example A: &rdquo;Default&rdquo; -&gt; Model output is public domain*<br/>The collector scrapes data from many sites on the public internet without permission from owners.  The trainer uses this dataset to train a generative AI model. The model end-user feeds the model a prompt and the model&rsquo;s response is public domain.<br/>Reasoning: Due to the incorporation of the appropriated dataset into the model via training the response from the model can reproduce portions of the input but also can generate completely new things.  Due to this unknown the outputs could be public domain in general but perhaps copywrite could be claimed if they are compared against all the inputs and found to be unique.  Still the ownership of the copyright is ambiguous so perhaps public domain is more appropriate.<br/><br/>Example B: Fully explicitly licensed<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull; Input Data: All data owners explicitly 1) allow data to be used for training a model, 2) release ownership rights of data when stored and used in aggregate and 3) release any claim on the output<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull; Trained Model: Trainer licenses the model such that &#39;end-user owns the output&#39;<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull; Model output: End-user is able to get copyright on model output.<br/><br/>Example C: nuanced?<br/>Perhaps there could be a clear framework developed to deal with more nuanced situations.<br/><br/>Economic Benefits, There could be industry around<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull; Monetizing data into permissioned/licensed datasets<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull; Scanning output against datasets for uniqueness<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull; Determining attribution, some licenses may require attribution <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>&bull; Tracking provenance: In large works that combine human and AI generated material, tracking the portions generated by human vs AI.<br/><br/>* The output of a human level or greater sentient being should be copyrightable by that being. Once a system has achieved human or greater sentience the system should be given all the rights and responsibilities of a citizen.<br/>
