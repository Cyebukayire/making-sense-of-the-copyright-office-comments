From the overuse of the term &quot;Transformative&quot; to mean &quot;beneficial,&quot; to the deliberate and calculated confusion with advances in unrelated fields requiring the surreptitious use of unrelated copyrighted works, the unabashed promotion of exploitative &quot;AI&quot; tools stems primarily from quarterly-motivated PR and marketing firms, departments, and CEOs. The rhetoric these organizations deploy mocks the passionate labor that fuels the enrichment of for-profit companies under the poisoned TechNet umbrella, and beyond.<br/><br/>Whether it&#39;s the enthusiastic claims from these companies about &quot;promises&quot; that are neither guaranteed nor enforceable, and who currently bear no responsibility for the illegal misuse of Generative AI, or the diatribes about a robust information economy that can only exist through the unfettered exploitation of creative labor, upon which current generative models rely&mdash;why should these organizations gain vast money and influence by competing in markets they knowingly exploit to fuel their systems and market appeal?<br/><br/>Why is it assumed that a company can, without consent from anyone, utilize the copyrighted work of others to train for-profit services that then compete in the same space as those works?<br/><br/>Why do these companies get to instill fear of &quot;AGI&quot; (Artificial General Intelligence), which is largely still theoretical, and then deliberately confuse it with &quot;Generative AI&quot; to further their agenda of exploitative behavior?<br/><br/>When we strip away all the puffery, marketing, and manipulation, we are left with very simple ethical and legal questions:<br/><br/>1. Should companies seek consent from and pay individuals to use their copyrighted materials, especially when those companies stand to make money in venture capital, seed funding, and service models, granting them additional access to regulatory processes through lobbying?<br/><br/>2. Is the manner in which these generative models are trained identical to the processes by which humans learn?<br/><br/>You will undoubtedly encounter a ceaseless parade of promotional nonsense, wordplay, and pressure from companies that stand to gain absurd money and influence from the use and abuse of these technologies. Many of them ascribe to accelerationist perspectives and seem to believe the idea of &quot;progress,&quot; no matter the form, is unquestionably desirable, ignoring that terrible things can also progress.<br/><br/>From an individual who has had their future stripped from them by proponents of exploitative generative AI, many of whom have no compunction about deliberately seeking out your work to train models as an act of revenge for daring to propose regulation of these technologies,<br/><br/>From an individual who has witnessed firsthand the depression and crises experienced by colleagues and friends who have their livelihoods rifled through and exploited by these companies,<br/><br/>From an individual who may no longer benefit from their own work, which is the core of why copyright was founded,<br/><br/>Please read through the manipulation, gaslighting, techno-babble, and then simplify. Many people want to muddy this conversation with details and abstractions, but the core issues and how they&#39;re represented, protected, and enforced will shape the future for us all.<br/><br/>If individuals have power over their own works, let it be enforced and protected.<br/><br/>If they do not, and all output from individuals belongs to companies seeking profit, where does the train end, and in what fashion?<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
