I believe we are moving much too fast on AI with insufficient knowledge.  I also feel, as an artist, that there are no regulations in effect to protect our work which may appear online.  This is a livelihood for many and there needs to be protections to ensure that ones&#39; work is protected and not stolen for use by anyone who sees fit to use it.  Please protect the artists, writers, songwriters, performers and artists in all mediums from encroachment of their materials by others through the use of AI.
