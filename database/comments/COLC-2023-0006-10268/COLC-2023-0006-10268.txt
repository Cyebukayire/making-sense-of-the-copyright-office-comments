Generative AI has been harvesting enormous amounts of content that they use to &quot;train&quot; their programs so that they can regurgitate it in some fashion to hype their products. They have never asked the owners of this content for permission and now seek to pay lawsuits for those offenders who are challenged by copyright laws and legal content owners. This situation is out of control and needs to stop. Bootlegging content used to be illegal and stealing alongside of it. This is the wild-wild west of tech and we cannot allow our creatives to be stolen from to feed the enormous appetite of the AI engines without compensation, permission or consequence.<br/>What&#39;s the point of copyright laws or patents if we allow this type of theft to continue unabated?
