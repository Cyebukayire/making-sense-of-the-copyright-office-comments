Anything created by AI in an attempt to be art is plagiarism because artificial intelligence is unable to create something original and requires samples in order to produce the desired product. As such, anything generated by AI for entertainment, education or business related reasons should not be available to copyright. AI generated products steal from real content creators whose skills are extremely valuable and without which, AI would have nothing to produce from in the first place.
