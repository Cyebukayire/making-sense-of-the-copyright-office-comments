AI-generated &quot;art&quot; is just plagiarism with extra steps. Companies steal artists&#39; work to train their machine, and then the machine can spit out something similar on command. AI is not sentient. It is not inspired by others&#39; art like a human would be. It is a mindless machine following patterns. It has no awareness of what it&#39;s doing. It is a tool for plagiarism that humans can exploit. The AI was trained on and will replicate stolen work. It&#39;s plagiarism on a massive scale. It&#39;s also unfair market competition. With just a prompt, a human can have an AI cobble together a drawing or a script or a novel in seconds versus the days, weeks, months, years that it would take a human. And the AI is only able to do that because it&#39;s using all that stolent artwork as training data. It will use the original artists&#39; own work against them because who will want to hire a human to produce art when an AI will do it instaneously for free and even in that artist&#39;s style?
