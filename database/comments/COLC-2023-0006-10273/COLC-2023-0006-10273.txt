I&#39;m extremely concerned over the use of AI in our society. I&#39;m in the Entertainment industry so the use of AI in my profession poses specific issues one being the possible loss of bodily autonomy. If Producers use synthetic performers (AI) that creates an inability to issue consent. An example: I could be scanned and then the AI version of myself can be made to perform in projects and in scenes that go against my personal ethics. Also the use of synthetic performers instead of Human performers would create the loss of employment across all areas of the Entertainment industry. <br/><br/>The broader potential risks with the use AI in our society include: deep fakes of political leaders and others of influence which can create issues like social manipulation. Politicians and others of influence rely on social platforms to promote their viewpoints. AI technologies make it easy to create realistic photos, videos, audio clips or replace the image of one figure with another in an existing picture or video. As a result, bad actors have another avenue for sharing misinformation and propaganda, creating a possible nightmare scenario where it can be nearly impossible to distinguish between creditable and faulty news. <br/><br/>Also other issues include: <br/>- Mass unemployment as a cheaper automation of jobs can replace the human workforce across all industry sectors. <br/>- Loss of our privacy as there can be date breaches. AI collects data to operate but who stores that data and who regulates the use of it.<br/>- Copy right issues as it would be impossible to discern where the data inputed (the prompts and the learning data) into the AI model originated.
