Hello. As a film and television actor my likeness, recorded performances, etc are all being consumed by AI as &quot;learning materials.&quot; This material is then used by AI to train itself how to replicate me or any number of my countless colleagues world wide. My likeness, voice, performance, etc. - which are all legally due compensation for their use- will then be regurgitated in any way the AI is commanded to perform. This presents many alarming options of what one could be shown as doing through the use of &quot;deep fake&quot; technology. It also offers the very real threat of rendering my occupation obsolete. This technology is in dire need of government regulation. The rate at which it is growing in its abilities is alarming and our government has not been taking the existential threat AI poses seriously.
