I wish that I had more time and energy to appropriately craft a response for this, as the issue of &quot;AI&quot; has caused me immense distress and harm.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I&#39;ve been continuing to recuperate from a severe illness that nearly took my life this summer. Recovering is taking nearly all the energy and time available, so I&#39;ll give a brief description of how I feel about the topic.<br/><br/>First, to try and protect myself, I&#39;ve removed ALL of my art and photography from online. I do NOT CONSENT to my work being scraped. Yet, it feels that every platform and company is exploiting access to my data for profit. Even ones just involved with privately storing my digital art! Such as Samsung being able to use the photos I send to my friends.<br/><br/>I&#39;m a professional artist trying to establish a career as a freelancer, but I find it harder and harder to see a future where that&#39;s possible.<br/><br/>As a citizen, I&#39;m concerned greatly about surveillance, abusive marketing,  scams, propaganda, and my image being used to generate porn. In also concerned about the concept of truth being eroded in schools... the deskilling of our population. What the heck will we even do about data laundering, wealth hoarding, and the ever growing monopolies of tech industries? <br/><br/>As a being on this planet, I&#39;m greatly concerned about the environmental cost you the generative power demand.<br/><br/>As a person who cares about science and research, I am extremely concerned about the usage of &quot;AI&quot; in these areas.<br/><br/>Some out the best voices I refer to on these topics include Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, Ben Zhao, Cory Doctorow, Dan Olsen, Jon Lam, Steven Zapata, and Karla Oritz.<br/><br/>I believe the best approach is to treat generative &quot;AI&quot; like we do lead. Preventative measures are much more effective than harm response AFTER the fact. Regulations are only so useful with a machinery that is so easily exploitable.<br/><br/>
