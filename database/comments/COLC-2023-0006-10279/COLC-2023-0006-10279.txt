A very important aspect of these generative AI models that needs to be taken into account is that the vast, vast majority of the information, data, words, images, and content they have scraped from in order to train on are NOT owned or paid for by the engineers or companies. They&#39;re stolen without permission or knowledge of the creators and fed into the machine learning algorithms in order to train it to replicate them. It&#39;s cut and dry theft. These machine learning algorithms are not autonomous or intelligent. They&#39;re only rearranging things that people have illegally put in and spitting out an approximation built from that stolen input. There&#39;s no human, creative, or artistic intention to its images and text. They are all just a computer running equations to organize pixels and words it does not understand into a predefined shape. The end product is completely interchangeable with any of the other dozen things it might spit out. It doesn&#39;t inherently understand the things it&#39;s working with. The machines cannot learn on their own. It can only recognize a Dolphin once you&#39;ve inputted thousands of pictures of Dolphins, and these inputs are scraped from the internet without any regard for who already owns them. Allowing these machine learning algorithms to run rampant as is is a threat to copyright holders the world over.
