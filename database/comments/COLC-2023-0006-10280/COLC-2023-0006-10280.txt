Hello and thank you for the opportunity to comment on this emerging field of generative A.I. It is my opinion that the prompted output or result of image generating A.I. models such as those produced by DALLe, for example, should grant copyrights to the human user who created the string of words that served as a prompt or seed value for the image, which would otherwise not exist. The prompt itself is a creative and unique encoding of language which the A.I. relies upon in order to generate a correspondingly unique image. The DALLe and generative A.I. models in general serve as the brush, or the paint, and the canvase, but the art is created by the human user&#39;s creative and unique linguistic input. I have attached an image generated by DALLe based on my input to demonstrate this work. Thank you for your consideration.
