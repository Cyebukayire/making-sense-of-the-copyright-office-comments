We need better copyright laws with the getting stronger age of A.I. Personally, I&#39;d prefer if progress went back to things a few years ago before A.I. could &quot;write&quot; an presentation or an essay in one&#39;s own ( and anyone else&#39;s Stolen voice for that matter) and before A.I. was scanning and copying art online. However I would just sounded like an older generation person, &quot;stuck in their ways&quot; and &quot;complaining about how things were better before&quot;, the only option now is to better the laws now so original creators&#39; rights can be protected. Right now A.I. is still pretty shifty and awful but the longer this goes on, the smoother it&#39;s gonna get. Besides why should it&#39;s advancements be rushed; slow it down, give it some time to actually be good before the companies release it to the public. A.I. is used mostly for the fact that it&#39;s convenient and it saves time; an easy tool. The misuse of this tool only hurts people. It&#39;s easier to steal art, there are now records and events of people using it to &quot;write&quot; a book in a famous person or author&#39;s voice to gain money, and worse of all, it can be used to make nude images of someone&#39;s normal pictures. &quot;What&#39;s the big deal about that?&quot; you might say, &quot;The sex/porn industry has made use of many technological advancements that have hurt people.&quot; Well, the use of A.I. to doctor photos has seen a recent rise in blackmail photos, especially towards women. A.I. misusers have threatened people with fake realistic nude photos. What if this has been used on minors? There&#39;s a lot of sickos in the world. Victims need to have their rights protected. It just comes back to money over talent on this. A.I. makes this cold and mechanical, about supply and demand. The lazy get rich easier and the talented will become overlooked and maybe even scared to show their work, for fear of it being stolen. Just look at the SAG-AFTRA Writers&#39; and Actors&#39; Strike, followed by the animators strike, the SFX strike and the Marvel strike. One of the set-off point was the fact that the studio execs wanted to get an A.I. scan image on background actors and use those (honestly awful-looking and does NOT age well) CGI image doubles for however long they like while the actors would only get paid for 1 day&#39;s work where their image was stolen. That isn&#39;t fair, no matter how you slice it. And same thing with the writers&#39; guild, steal their voice, pay for less. Would 1 million dollars less really be that hard for the 1% execs. How dare these kinds of people steal credit, money, hard work and time from those who put in the effort. How dare misusers attack artists who are already being taken advantage of. These crimes are made possible because A.I. isn&#39;t being policed like it needs to be. If all works of art become A.I. generated, how will we be able to tell what good work is. No one to actually think for themselves because the A.I. will &quot;do it for you and do it better.&quot; Art and A.I.-generated is like cooking naturally and using an air fryer. The air fryer may be convenient and cook faster, but food is better when you make it yourself. Creators of programs like A.I. should really consider all the people that could get hurt with their creations before they start selling. It should be forcibly restricted to work environments only, if necessary. And keep A.I. out of media. It cannot even look up photo searches well. Just try look for a picture of an autistic child; they all look the same depressing little white boy (me saying this is not racist, as I am white myself). Seriously, if one is going to &quot;better&quot; life for the general public, why not start with an A.I. to do jobs that are dangerous or demanding for people? A.I. generating just projects an image of stealing at this point. I know this may seem like a generational issue that &quot;will pass&quot; but people are concerned. They want their rights to create their own work of any kind to be protected from stealing. That&#39;s normal and should be expected at this point. I don&#39;t think it should be too hard to better the copyright laws to protect against A.I. scanning and generating. Make A.I. theives pay back 10x the money they made with the stolen work back to all the victims. And for patriotics&#39; sake, do something about the A.I. nude image generating. It&#39;s all fun and jokes like a series of minors get blackmailed (and their families sue for the A.I.&#39;s gross misuse). And I cannot stress this enough, thinking about how A.I. is ruining everything for the writers, artists, and hard workers I care about, it makes me dangerously anxious, like suicidal anxious. I think I;ve made my point.
