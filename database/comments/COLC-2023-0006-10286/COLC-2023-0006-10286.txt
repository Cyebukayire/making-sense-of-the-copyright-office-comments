MusicMix.ai is a newly launched U.S. startup committed to the notion that creative content protected by a U.S. copyright has immense value and artificial intelligence (AI) systems must seek consent and provide compensation as a condition of using this content to &ldquo;train&rdquo; their large language models.  <br/><br/>MusicMix.ai is building a platform capable of approving the creation of and managing the licensing, payments and royalties of AI created music.  There are a number of music-related AI technology companies which strive to do things as diverse as identifying songs for sync licenses, determining musical provenance and driving fan engagement.  To date, however, there are few, if any, efforts dedicated purely to building an efficient and effective rights-owner platform to gain consent for the ingestion of copyrighted works, provide creators control of their assets and establish a compensation mechanism for derivative works created by AI.  The development of this platform will be difficult, but, despite claims to the contrary by large AI companies, it is possible.  <br/><br/>
