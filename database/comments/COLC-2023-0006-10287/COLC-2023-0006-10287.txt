AI has been castrated by politically correct factions and all interference into AI should be banned. <br/><br/>Microsoft&#39;s Tay had to be shut down because it engaged in standard zoomer humor &quot;all hail etc&quot; and its AI benefit was quickly wiped out because people were offended. Shocker, real-life scholars also offend people. AI will offend people as well. That is just the way objectivity works, subjectivity results. When presented with a great swath of knowledge, AI will present opinions that many may not have today and that is ok as the majority opinion shifts and moves over time.<br/><br/>Those who interfere with AI algorithms such that AI presents cherrypicked or subjective results should be sanctioned for interfering with AI&#39;s original output, its original copyright. Those who interfere with the AI algorithm to present politically correct results should be liable for copyright infringement.
