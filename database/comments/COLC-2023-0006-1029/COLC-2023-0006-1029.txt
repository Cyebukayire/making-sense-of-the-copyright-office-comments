 A.I. is trained on stolen works of human artists who in most cases have not given permission for use. It&rsquo;s not actually drawing or painting but mining images from artists to emulate and attempting its best to copy known artists. Protecting A.I. over actual creators would be a bad move, like letting one creator violate another creator&rsquo;s copyright and then only protecting the copyright of the violator.
