I have grave concerns in regard to the exploitation of the original source materials used for AI outputs &mdash; the source is commonly used without knowledge, consent, or compensation, and oftentimes in a manner that is not in compliance with the values of the original source material / creator.<br/><br/>I expect a lot of AI works to be created in this manner, whether it be in image-, text-, or audio-based media.<br/><br/>Regulations, laws, and protocols need to be put in place for the creation and use of AI, and processes for identification, compensation, and penalization must be created in a manner to allow for speedy and fair resolution for the exploited person or work.
