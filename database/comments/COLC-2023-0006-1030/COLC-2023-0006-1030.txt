&quot;AI&quot; or advanced predictive text and image models that attempt to replicate human-created art are operating from an advanced statistical analysis of a dataset; they do not create new content so much as mash-up the content in their data set to create something that looks reasonably like whatever the prompt requests. The result is unique, but the computer model cannot reasonably be said to have used its own creativity to generate it in the way that a human does. It is a product of the dataset which was fed into the machine learning model. Unfortunately for all models that currently exist, that dataset consists primarily of stolen data to which the owners of the machine do not own the copyright. I&#39;m concerned about the potential harm to the copyright holders of the components of the dataset from having their work used as fodder for an automated mix-and-match text or art generation process, which may be used to make the products of the actual creators decrease in value. I do not think that the computer model or its owners can reasonably be said to hold any copyright over the products of such a dataset, but even without granting them any copyright the mere existence of the dataset and ability to exploit it creates a potential loophole for theft of protected content.
