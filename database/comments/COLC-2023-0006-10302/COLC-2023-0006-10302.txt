To Whom it may Concern, <br/><br/> <br/><br/>We are middle school teachers at Lakeside School in Seattle, WA. We teach a course called Digital Life, and the focus of their 7th grade class is on emerging technologies and the ethics of A.I.  Students have been studying generative AI and copyright.  For a recent assignment, we asked them to respond to your Note of Inquiry.  These 33 students are artists, musicians, authors, and creators and have a lot to say about the future of copyright and A.I. We hope that someone takes the time to read the thoughts of these 12 and 13 year old students who have a lot to say about ownership and Artificial Intelligence.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you, <br/><br/>Janelle Hagen and Aleks Jovcic
