Commercial generative models trained on materials owned by others (e.g. public web data) fall outside the protections of fair use on two grounds. <br/><br/>The first issue is the financial nature of models from which revenue may be derived. The commercial nature of these models alone is sufficient for denial of fair use protections.<br/><br/>The second issue is the fact that generative models fail to transform the data on which they are trained. Statistical models are prone to &ldquo;overfitting&rdquo;, or memorizing their inputs and &ldquo;generating&rdquo; those pieces of training data as output. See e.g. figure six of the following for a visual depiction of this issue, with discussion: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03396.pdf. The failure to transform training data strips these models of any claims of transformative use, which is additional grounds for denial of fair use protection.
