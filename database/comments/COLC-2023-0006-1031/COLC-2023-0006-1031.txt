As an artist myself, I find the use of AI a horrible detriment to the creative community and it&#39;s people&#39;s wellbeing. The AI uses a large data pool of art from different sources, but there is no probable way of giving proper credit to its sources, nor compensating many which have copyright protections in place. Thus this AI tool is by all means illegally stealing, threatening many with it&#39;s illegal thievery, and serves no greater purpose than to undermine many who depend on their art for their main source of income, or even side source of income. I would ask that heavy guidelines, and strict regulations be placed on these tools with steep fines for those that try to bypass said rules, to protect artists and copyright holders.
