Artwork and other intellectual property should not be allowed to be used for training AI without the express permission of the creator/copyright owner. If someone wanted to use artwork that I created in any other type of training materials, they would be expected to obtain my permission for that, and I would be compensated for their use. Since the company/organization would be benefitting from the time and effort it took me to create that product, I should be compensated for the use of it. If a person or entity sees work on my website or social media and wants to use it for any other purpose or context, it would be standard procedure to contact me first and request the rights to do so via a contract/mutual agreement. If they did not do so, I would have the right to sue for copyright infringement. This should be no different with AI. I still did the work, the person or entity who created the AI is still profiting from that work without my permission. Even moreso, with AI, the resulting application may well be creating work that is extremely derivative or even imitative of my work, which then may deprive me of significant potential income, in addition to denying me fair compensation for the copyrighted materials I created which were used during the actual training process. We are just asking that AI follow the same logic as any other circumstance, and that we prioritize the rights and well-being of human beings who contribute to society and  have lives and families to support. Thank you for your time. You have a chance to make a real difference here, in so many people&#39;s lives.
