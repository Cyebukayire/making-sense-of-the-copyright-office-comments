To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>I am Sam Van Cook, the founder and president of Button Poetry, an independent publishing company that produces books, videos, and other media. I urge the Copyright Office to support human authors and artists against theft and predation by tech companies and Generative AI developers.<br/><br/>As evidenced by the extent of your request for comments, there are many complex questions to be answered here. In this letter, though, I want to simply focus on the authors I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to publish and work with over the years.<br/> <br/>There is now definitive proof through The Atlantic&rsquo;s reporting that at least nine of these authors&rsquo; books with Button Poetry have been stolen for the profit of Generative AI developers&mdash;against their wishes, against copyright and competition law, against fair use, and using an illegal library of pirated copies of my press&rsquo;s books. With the multitude of companies engaging in this theft, the true number is likely much higher.<br/> <br/>I feel a strong personal responsibility as a caretaker of these books, as someone these authors have trusted to help bring their creations, their words and their stories, to the world. The people I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work with and publish are some of the most interesting, talented, unique, flat-out amazing humans I&rsquo;ve ever met. The dedication and compassion they put into their art often leaves me speechless, and I started this press as a poet and performer myself.<br/> <br/>The loss that we face if this theft is allowed to continue unabated, or if artificially generated works are allowed to receive copyright, is not just a loss of property or financial security (yes, there is some financial security to be found, even in poetry!)&mdash;it is also a loss of what I think matters most about our humanity. The connections we form through our words and our art, through sharing the pieces of our lives and our minds in what we create, and being allowed to do so without fear of it being stolen and wielded so directly against us.<br/> <br/>I could write many additional pages on this, but that is the heart of it. In lieu of more, I&rsquo;d also like to voice my support for the comments from The Authors Guild and other artist and author advocacy organizations. Button Poetry has enacted a set of policies and commitments to help safeguard our readers and authors as best we can, viewable here, which explicitly bans the usage of any of our titles for data mining and training: https://buttonpoetry.com/policies/. I hope the Copyright Office will do everything in its power to support authors and artists and to help make that possible and enforceable.  <br/> <br/>&mdash;Sam Van Cook<br/>
