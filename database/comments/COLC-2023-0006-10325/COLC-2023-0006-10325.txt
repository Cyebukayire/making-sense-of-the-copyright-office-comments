Public comments posted in regard to Artificial Intelligence and Copyright fall into two camps. Those who create writings, photography, and artwork and those who want to be able to benefit from others&#39; work. I am in the first camp. As an academic writer, i must follow strict rules for referencing others&#39; intellectual property, and I must get explicit, written permission to use figures or images in my publications. When my copyright-protected materials are used in classrooms or other settings, I receive a check. <br/><br/>However, if a for-profit, well-funded technology company wants to use my work I am not given the right to consent or to opt out. I do not even receive an acknowledgment that my work was used, or how it was used. While we read about billions of dollars being invested in companies that create AI tools, somehow they don&#39;t see the need to compensate those whose works are used to &quot;train&quot; their tools.<br/><br/>One argument in favor of the free fair use camp states &quot;So in a sense, what is being done is like, no human being<br/>is seeing these texts. They&#39;re being tokenized, broken apart, and studied by this computer program...&quot; This is problematic for academic writings, which aim to present a logical sequence in the discussion of problem, reference to prior studies of the problem, methods used to study it, and discussion of results. Generally, this kind of writing for scholarly journals is labor intensive but unpaid. The &quot;reward&quot; the researcher gets is in presenting this work in full to others who can learn from it. The only thing the writer has is the integrity of this work. Breaking this kind of writing into bits destroys its integrity. Writers of copyright protected work, even if it is available in an open-access journal, should have the right to refuse usage by AI, and should be compensated when it is used by AI. <br/><br/>Fair use, primarily in place to allow schools and universities to use materials in the classroom, seems laughable when applied to AI. Companies using my work, and any other writers&#39; and artists&#39; work, are not being FAIR when they do not solicit consent, allow the right to refuse, and take the work with no compensation. Not fair in any sense of the word!<br/><br/>I hope that the U.S. Copyright Office will take a stand that is truly fair to creators!
