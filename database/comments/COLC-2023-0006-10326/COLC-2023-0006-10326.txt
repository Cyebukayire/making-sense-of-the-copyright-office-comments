Hello USCO,<br/><br/>In response to the questions, &quot;What kinds of copyright-protected training materials are used to train AI models, and how are those materials collected and curated?&quot; and &quot;How or where do developers of AI models acquire the materials or datasets that their models are trained on?&quot;<br/><br/>I&#39;ve authored the website https://whatsinlaion.com . Details about the site were included in my initial submission.<br/><br/>My comment today is simply a follow-up. Please view a brief video walkthrough at either of the video links below.<br/><br/>https://youtu.be/Y071Ml8uP2I?si=PZXgfILODKTpa-Co<br/>https://x.com/mfrankDude/status/1732525509131854200?s=20<br/><br/>Thank you.
