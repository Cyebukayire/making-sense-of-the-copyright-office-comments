I believe that what the copyright office is doing with registering GenAI is good. But it still can be improved upon. Reinforcing copyright holders rights would be a good direction. For example, getting an explicit permission from the copyright holder should be a must. Even if its used for non-commercial purposes. <br/><br/>I wouldn&#39;t give GenAI the right to have their works being used for commercial purposes. Only if the dataset have identifiable markers that they don&#39;t have copyrighted material in their datasets. Only those with explicit permission or the data is copyright free.<br/><br/>The markers that Im talking about is that the dataset can be seen by the public. The sources or the prompt is tagged in the metadata of the work. The prompt used must reveal what data it used for creating the work.<br/><br/>In terms of GenAI having copyright is out of the question. It would be difficult to ascertain if the work is made by a human. Even when the prompt is consistent with its output. It is still subjected to what other changes the developers are going to make on the GenAI. Which will inevitably change the output of the GenAI even when using the same prompt. <br/><br/>In art programs like Photoshop, when the program is being updated. The output would still be the same. The user is not bound by the GenAI when the developers have made changes in how it operates.<br/><br/>The concern that I have with GenAI is it can be used to replace human workers in the entertainment and art industry. The technology is only getting better and it could take over the industry. Without regulations for GenAI. Not only people who are working in big companies can be replaced. But independent artists or companies, will have their work stolen and used in datasets if regulation isn&#39;t made or maintained.<br/><br/>The other concern is that GenAI will be used in scams or crimes. This technology is already convincing for other people and it is getting harder to distinguish from what is made with GenAI or not. Which could lead to Scam Calls being more prevelent. Fake news being made fast, easy and en masse and many more crimes involving GenAI. So its best that GenAI should be regulated and copyright holders and their works should be protected.
