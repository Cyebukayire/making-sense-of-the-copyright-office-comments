Copywright should belong to people who great works of their own and from their own labor. AI generated work should not be considered copwrighted or have the ability to be copywrighted, especially when it has been trained using work stolen from other creators. Anyone that uses AI to steal and manipulate that stolen work should be prosecuted for theft or plagiarism where applicable.
