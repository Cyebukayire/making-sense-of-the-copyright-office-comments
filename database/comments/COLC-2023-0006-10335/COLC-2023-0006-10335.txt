I am a screenwriter and write this comment in attempt to urge the Copyright Office to stop the blatant theft of creative&#39; work by AI companies. While these companies argue that their AI systems are merely &quot;creating&quot; after being &quot;inspired by&quot; datasets comprised of human creators&#39; works in the same way that a human is inspired by their human predecessors, this is far from accurate. A human creator&#39;s intent isn&#39;t to be a photocopy of someone else&#39;s work. You may note elements that you like, but the goal is always to make it something new and your own. You want to make something that adds yourself, and your life experiences to something you&#39;ve seen in the past, but you don&#39;t want to be an exact replica. AI is not capable of anything but theft and plagiarism because it has no life experience or human self to add to the creative equation. It&#39;s only way of &quot;creating&quot; something &quot;new&quot; is to steal two other human-creatives&#39; styles, paste them together, and regurgitate that. You can tell AI to write a David Sedaris version of Lincoln In The Bardo, but it&#39;s not creating something new. It&#39;s stealing two artist&rsquo;s distinct works (without consent or compensation) and regurgitating a product that only benefits the companies that told it to do this.&nbsp;This method of &ldquo;creating&rdquo; not only robs a human creator of their style, but also punishes them for having a style (the thing we&rsquo;ve always been encouraged to develop as a creator, and which often takes YEARS to find) in the first place. There is no fair method for humans to compete if the second you develop a unique product (your style) you are mined by AI companies for regurgitated duplicates that, again, only make money for heads of tech. Please do not let this theft, plagiarism, and the destruction of the creator market be destroyed by AI and it&rsquo;s developers. Thank you. Protect human creators. Thank you.
