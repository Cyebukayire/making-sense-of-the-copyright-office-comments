I&rsquo;m a film and TV worker and the prevalence of AI in the entertainment industry as it&rsquo;s being essentially forced upon by studios and major streamers is a threat to my livelihood. Regardless of industry, I wholeheartedly believe that AI should not be trained using the hard work of actual laborers who have spent countless hours and resources honing their craft - there absolutely needs to be militant regulation on how AI is trained so that actual human beings won&rsquo;t be replaced and be callously put in a position where they&rsquo;re out of work and replaced by machinery. We need humans to tackle creative and scientific pursuits and more crucially we need incredibly strict AI regulation immediately so that employers don&rsquo;t exploit the existing work of all laborers.
