Meta:<br/>Whatever. You&rsquo;re here to make sequels. &ldquo;A reasonable continuation&rdquo; if you will. You&rsquo;ve got to pay Carrie-Anne Moss twice the going rate to come back and you don&rsquo;t want to pay the writers on top of that. <br/>Intelligence is measured by negative reinforcement. When bad things happen, intelligent beings adapt. <br/>That&rsquo;s not how AI conducts itself. AI is doomed to repeat any mistake of the past as long as that mistake is sufficiently popular. It isn&rsquo;t learning, it&rsquo;s reinforcing bad behavior. <br/>it is interesting that in a Hollywood that is becoming blacker and more female, studios are insisting that we reasonably continue the past.<br/><br/>Stability: <br/>If we step back far enough, the differences between us become immaterial. That&rsquo;s what artists do. That&#39;s where Gestalt comes from. If we step back far enough, we travel not only in distance but also in time. <br/>Students are thus encouraged to work in order from general to specific in their art. Ai is doomed to the uncanny valley because it skips steps in that process, because it doesn&#39;t make studies, because it is not capable of stepping back from a painting. AI can&#39;t see the forest for the trees. <br/>Convenience is the enemy of the good. Incest is convenient. Incest is a bad idea because your kids might end up looking like they were drawn by AI.<br/><br/>Technet:<br/>Photos and recordings are important because they allow light and music to travel great distances.<br/>AI art doesn&rsquo;t travel at all. It is art made by people who live in basements for people who live in basements. It is backlit, disoriented, and it has no idea what a woman looks like.<br/>This isn&#39;t democracy. This is fascism, every artist subject to one overpromoted fraud. AI silences new art and artists.  There are no AI art critics. <br/>AI is not a democracy; it&#39;s an emperor with no clothes. He thinks he&#39;s Michelangelo and we&#39;re all supposed to play along.<br/><br/>Microsoft:<br/>AI allows every man to be a legend in his own mind. In too many ways AI is like a conspiracy theory: it explains everything but it requires absolute silence from everyone else. <br/>A good artist can talk about their inspirations and their process. Nirvana can talk about Lead Belly. Can an AI artist talk about their process or their inspiration? Would anyone want to listen?<br/>Whether it&#39;s a movie theater or politics, life is about concessions. Learning how to lose is a life skill. With AI there are no happy accidents, no things that we aren&#39;t here for, no things that we didn&#39;t know we needed. It&rsquo;s Michelangelo or bust.<br/>A Final Note:<br/>Every piece of art starts with the question &ldquo;How was your day?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the one question AI can&rsquo;t answer.<br/>
