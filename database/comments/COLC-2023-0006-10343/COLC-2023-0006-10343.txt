I am an American actor. I have no celebrity to my name, but after being on strike when our contract with the AMPTP expired, one of the reasons for the work stoppage has been the advancement of AI in the industry. We cannot deny that AI is here; no one functions without it these days. It has become a seamless part of our lives, a tool we cannot live without. But when the tool is moving into the position of replacing human beings in an industry, such as that of entertainment which is dependent on the work of human beings, discussion of this sort causes concern. This industry was founded on the public falling in love with human beings and their performances - Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Meryl Streep, Denzel Washington, Viola Davis - to name a few. Anything other than human beings will lessen the quality of the entertainment business. Parlance of AI in the entertainment industry threatens to supplant human beings and it is moving at lightening speed. To open the door to conversation of using digital replicas - aka clones - and synthetic fakes will pave the road to making it acceptable to be replaced by non-human entities. We go to the movies and watch TV to see stories reflective of the human experience. You cannot program/code human emotion. To relinquish what is uniquely human to artificial intelligence is a slippery slope. As AI makes inroads into an industry that tailors and provides stories of the human experience to the world, it will be the beginning of a takeover of ALL industries. It&#39;s not even the beginning; we are well into this movement that is advancing at exponential speed. Copyright regulations and guardrails need to be put in place to harness how and to what degree we use AI.
