AI companies have, of course, almost unanimously argued that their use of any and all kinds of art on the internet to train their models should be allowed practically unimpeded, and they have offered a variety of reasons for this. I oppose this. I&#39;ll list some of their arguments and offer my own perspective on them:<br/><br/>- &quot;Since AI models only produce derivative works of existing artworks, the training of AI models with any art that we can gain access to is protected under &quot;fair use.&quot; I have two thoughts on this. First, copyright laws were created when generative AI models, as we know them today, had yet to arrive onto the scene, so I don&#39;t think they should be able to claim a law applies to a technology that hadn&#39;t even existed yet. Had generative AI been around when the copyright laws were written, they would probably look different than they do today. Second, the Supreme Court&#39;s interpretation of fair use in the recent court case Andy Warhol Foundation, Inc v. Goldsmith, which ruled that derivative artworks that compete with the original artworks are not protected under fair use, actually weakens AI companies&#39; fair use claim, since it&#39;s conceivable that a market flooded by AI-generated artwork could compete with the artworks that the models were trained on.<br/><br/>- &quot;There is fundamentally no difference in the way AI models are trained and in the way humans learn.&quot; It has been argued that since AI models, like humans, learn to create art by taking existing artworks and then drawing inspiration from them, then they should be afforded the same protections has human artists. To me, there are several glaringly obvious and important differences between AI models and humans that render this comparison severely flawed. There is no human on Earth, individually or collectively, that can view countless artworks, remember all of them perfectly, and then be able to instantly produce an endless number of new, original of them when prompted. But AI can.<br/><br/>- &quot;Artists only oppose the use of their artwork in training AI models because they fear losing their jobs to AI, but the fear of job loss alone is not grounds to regulate the training of AI models. Automation and the loss of jobs that result from it are natural consequences of technological innovation.&quot; It&#39;s true that technological innovation has and will continue to displace jobs and that this will cause people whose jobs are at risk, artists included, to resist technological progress and automation. I also acknowledge that this reason alone shouldn&#39;t be used to determine whether to limit technological innovation, but the situation between artists and AI, in this case, is especially different from past examples in that the works that the workers (artists) have produced are being used -- without any consent or forewarning whatsoever and on a massive scale -- to displace the very workers themselves. Had the AI companies purchased these workers&#39; artworks or hired in-house artists to create artworks specifically to train their AI models, then they would, of course, have complete freedom in automating and displacing the jobs of artists. However, they have resorted to, for a lack of better word, thievery to do this. <br/><br/>- &quot;AI is just a tool, so anything generated by AI should be copyrightable.&quot; The Copyright Office has already declared that AI artwork cannot be copyrighted, and since most AI models today are trained on copyrighted material without the copyrighted owners&#39; consent, I agree with their decision. If AI-generated artwork is to be copyrightable, then I think it should be required that the tool (i.e. the AI models) that is used to generate those artworks be given consent by everyone who contributed to creating that tool, including the artists themselves. Doing this would also sidestep the thorny issue of trying to prove what part of an artwork was generated by an AI vs. created by a human and to what extent a human should have a hand in creating an artwork to qualify for copyright.<br/><br/>To be clear, the sole concern of these AI companies is, and will always be, not the improvement of society or to promote the advancement of art, but to maximize profit. Paying the pesky artists, whose works are crucial to the success of their models, would be contrary to this pursuit. One need only look at their use of a pirated database of books to train their model to see this (and isn&#39;t using pirated media of any kind plain ol&#39; illegal anyway?), but that would cut into their bottom line. If copyright laws are unable to protect art from being used to train AI models without their owners&#39; consent, then anyone could take whatever and whosever artwork they find and create endless derivatives of it using AI. In that scenario, what would be the point of copyright laws at all? Artists can spend a lifetime learning and honing their craft, and they should be the ultimate decider in how and where their work is used.
