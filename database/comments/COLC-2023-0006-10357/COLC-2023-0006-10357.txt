Before I go on about the larger ramifications of allowing AI art to be allowed copyright, I initially want to state that any AI art made from programs that trained artists&#39; work without permission absolutely should not be [in-line] for copyright. While these LLMs may train in a way similar to how the human brain does, it is, first and foremost, a proprietary software&mdash;NOT a human, therefore it should not be subject to the same freedoms, laws, or rights afforded to humans.<br/><br/>I think being able to copyright AI art becomes highly problematic when it includes elements of someone&#39;s identity, for example, images of real people and their voices. AI images and vocal recreations have become so convincing as to be almost indistinguishable from the genuine article. This is already being abused by putting actors into pornographic or other highly compromising scenarios. AI voice programs like ElevenLabs has been criticized for its software being used to mimic peoples&#39; to say racist or homophobic things that could potentially get them fired or ruin future job prospects. Companies are already using hired voice actors voices&#39; to recreate their voices using AI and then selling it to other companies. The idea that these uses of AI could become copyrighted material is terrifying.
