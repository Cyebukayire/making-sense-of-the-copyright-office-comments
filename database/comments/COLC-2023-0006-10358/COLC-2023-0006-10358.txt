Copyrightability:<br/>18. Yes, there are models out there that offer significant amounts of control to the end-user in what the model produces. You can, using stable diffusion and the WebUI, &quot;generate&quot; an image that is merely a modification of an image that you, as an artist, made yourself. Feeding your own copyrighted work through a software that merely modifies it should not mean that you suddenly lose copyright over the end result.<br/>19. Yes. The lines are so blurry with what is &quot;de-minimis&quot; with AI assisted work, we need better standards. There are signficant choices in which a human author can make that deliver artistic intent to the finished work with modern AI tools.<br/>20. Yes, yes, maybe.<br/>21. Yes, because it&#39;s a human using a software tool to author material. These AI tools are non-volitional, it requires a human author to output anything.<br/>Infringement:<br/>22. It&#39;s possible to come close to reproducing copyrighted or trademarked work if the human author is doing so on purpose.<br/>23. It is enough.<br/>24.It is impossible if records are not kept.<br/>25. The end user who made the output. Just as it has been for photoshop, or photography, or written pen and paper.<br/>27. It should be considered that without a human author, the output of an AI system does not exist. It needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis what the AI tool system is, and what the output is, in order to determine copyrightability. If someone sits down and generates a million generic images from a prompt, perhaps copyright should not be given to the set on the basis of it being generated algorithmically. But if a human author sits down and contributes significant artistic intent to every piece of work that they make, they should absolutely be granted copyright over their output, just as a digital artist is granted copyright over their work via photoshop, or a photographer is granted output over what their camera generates from their intentions.<br/>28. No. Just as the law does not require us to note that something was made or edited in photoshop. This is dramatically overbearing.<br/>28.1. There&#39;s no trustable source to do so.<br/>28.2. Metadata can easily be stripped from or modified images and text, there&#39;s no feasible way to mark such things with any real confidence.<br/>28.3. Fines, at most.<br/>29. They exist, but they do not work. There are ultimately no &quot;smoking gun&quot; determinations to consider if a given work was made or edited via AI.<br/>Additional:<br/>32. No, style should not be copyrightable in any way. This would suffocate human creativity in a legal quagmire. AI systems can come close to quantify a human&#39;s style, but humans still cannot quantify a human&#39;s style. There&#39;s no way to do so in a satisfactory way.<br/>34. Please consider the fact that modern AI tools are not simply generative, but additive and subtractive. They can modify an human author&#39;s existing work in simple and complex ways. AI tools are being merged with traditional digital creation tools into one homogenous entity for creators. With modern tools, it&#39;s possible to have more control over the output of an AI-assisted workflow than photographers have over the output of their camera. AI tools are non-volitional, they do not do anything without a human author. The human author can easily be the creative force behind a given output, and should be given copyright over their work, especially when they were the ones who singificant artistic direction via providing original sketches or work for AI tools to modify.<br/>
