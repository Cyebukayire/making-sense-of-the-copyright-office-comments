Having reviewed the responses supporting or opposing the March 2023 Guidance requiring identification and disclaimer of more than de minimis AI contribution to a work offered for registration:<br/>I generally concur with the concerns of content creators, e.g., COLC-2023-0006-2199, COLC-2023-0006-4984, COLC-2023-0006-7478, COLC-2023-0006-8710 (Entertainment Software Association), COLC-2023-0006-8806 (National Music Publishers association), COLC-2023-0006-8935 (Copyright Alliance), COLC-2023-0006-8989 (Motion Picture Association, Inc.), and COLC-2023-0006-8989 (Peermusic and Boomy) that:<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Artificial intelligence (even &ldquo;generative&rdquo;) is broad and changing and may not be susceptible to the kind of judgment made in the Guidance<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The standard of &ldquo;de minimis&rdquo; is difficult to apply, an unreasonable burden, particularly for the unrepresented and may work a surprise to creators<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The standard is inconsistent with the &ldquo;appreciable&rdquo; standard in the Compendium for identifying public domain contributions (which do not require disclaimer because they are already ineligible); in my opening comment, I conflated the &ldquo;appreciable&rdquo; and de minimis standards<br/>Although I sympathize with the competitive concerns of COLC-2023-0006-8813,its example of &ldquo;human-washing&rdquo; and proposal of presumption non-copyrightabilty of works for hire created using AI software, I believe these concerns are better addressed by the market (who respects the registration by licensing or disrespects it by &ldquo;efficient infringement&rdquo;) or in relatively rare cases by the courts &ndash; rather than by the USCO a priori.<br/>As in my opening comments, I have presented the examples of use of automated tools such as photography (compare COLC-2023-0006-8720 at 20-21) as well as computer programs, the latter of which I find some inconsistency in COLC-2023-0006-8552 (AI generation being &ldquo;operative&rdquo; as the commentor&rsquo;s interpretation of Lotus) and the portion of COLC-2023-0006-8740 (at 18) proposing per se non-copyrightability in AI-assisted works based on &ldquo;prompt engineering,&rdquo; a term extending over a wide range of uses most popular since the mass introduction of ChatGPT a year ago.<br/>While I see some merit in Table 2 (page 11) of COLC-2023-0006-8567, in proposing &ldquo;thin&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; copyright for different contributions to different types of works (no for factual works or for simple prompts), again, I see the application of the &ldquo;thinness&rdquo; (or &ldquo;none-ness&rdquo;) of copyright in works not clearly involving human expression as best left to the market, and if necessary, to the courts.<br/>This has worked for photography for 150 years and for computer programs for nearly 50.  Creativity in both fields has not suffered for not requiring disclaimers to their scope.<br/>
