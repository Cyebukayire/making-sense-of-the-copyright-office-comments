AI should not be able to be copyrighted. It uses other people&rsquo;s hard work to create an amalgamation that is not the prompter&rsquo;s creative thought or expression. AI can easily generate misinformation through claiming that someone said something they didn&rsquo;t say or create something that they didn&rsquo;t create. It can be very easily abused by bad actors and even by those that may not think they&rsquo;re doing harm. AI such as ChatGPT can very easily spread misinformation because it&rsquo;s only taking words and information from multiple sources but is not give cohesive and factual information. The world is being filled with misinformation already and it needs to stop. Not allowing copyright for AI generated works will help in at least placing some kind of stopgap to some of the misinformation that is circulating currently and in the future.
