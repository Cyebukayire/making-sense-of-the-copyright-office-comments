If ai generation programs didn&#39;t scrape, steal, &amp; reconfigure infinite man hours of real world artists work *without compensation* to the living breathing humans that may not even know they have had their work stolen from them...it could be great.<br/>However, the programs do steal.<br/><br/>These programs FIND &amp; SCRAPE material from origin point creators or legacy conservators, then recombines the data to spit out a slick amalgam of imagery or words. It is beyond totally absurd to entertain the thought those sources can not be found again to be COMPENSATED monetarily for the work that was used.<br/><br/>Until that happens- where origin point creators *or* the caretakers of their legacies such as estate &amp; copyright holders, or museums that caretake the welfare of unique works- see financial compensation from the owners of generative ai programs and entities that monetize the fruits of ai generated content- what is being done to artists and origin point copyright holders is a crime. It&#39;s theft.<br/><br/>Theft is theft is theft.<br/>That crime will contaminate all the slick fake pretty it generates. <br/>That crime will contaminate the validity of any earnings or benefit ai generation produces.<br/><br/>As the scraper programs owners seem to see them as economically viable for *themselves* to pursue to the tune of investing multiple hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars spent on research- it seems absurd to dismiss the idea of monetary compensation to the origin work creators who are being stolen from.<br/><br/>Do not be complicit in withholding from creators or caretakers compensation for work they&#39;ve either created or protected. <br/>Artists who work need to be compensated. <br/>Museums that own and protect dead artists works- need to be compensated.<br/>Families who own dead artists work- need to be compensated.<br/><br/>There are ugly words for taking another humans work &amp; not paying for it for gain, the most appropriate one to use other than wage theft is *Slavery*.<br/><br/>The hours of other peoples lives spent laboring at commercially viable work MATTER.<br/><br/>Compensating them monetarily for the work they have used their life hours for MATTERS as much as your own compensation means TO YOU.<br/>To paying your bills. To living your lives.<br/><br/>Allowing companies which own the rights to monetize artificial intelligence programs which generate content by stealing work that belongs to others without compensation&nbsp; is hypocritically absurd.<br/><br/>It also undermines taxible incomes of the people being stolen from globally.<br/>If working artists, and creators, copyright and IP holders can no longer generate an income from their work because it is being stolen- there is no money available to them to pay their taxes. <br/>If governments are not interested in protecting artists &amp; creators &amp; copyright holders, perhaps they can express some selfish interest in protecting their own salaries.<br/><br/>
