Hello, I am writing specifically as a concerned citizen, worried about the current state of artificial intelligence. To me, the entirety of the mechanism of generative AI is copyright infringement. The companies scrape copyrighted works from the internet to use as training data, ostensibly as &#39;research&#39;, but the product of this stolen content is often put up for sale. As well, the mechanism of AI, in my opinion, does not constitute transformation, as transformation requires some sort of input by a human, like with every other part of copyright. Since the human input is essentially negligible (inputting a prompt is as &#39;human driven&#39; as asking God for a miracle - you did not put the work in.), and it was not created by a human, or with any sort of way to even tune the output, unlike in every other medium of the production of the arts, the entire process is copyright infringement. This is my opinion on generative AI, and my opinion on the regulatory action is to prevent these AIs from being used commercially, to prevent them from scraping copyrighted works, and to reaffirm that any sort of output from these AIs (such as for research purposes) does not have any sort of copyright protection, the same as it already is in common law. If regulatory action is not taken to prevent the use of AIs to infringe on copyright, then the notion of copyright is apparently null and void if you do enough math while you infringe upon copyright. I plead with you, as someone who deeply cares about art, about the nature of the arts and the process of creation, to prevent these AIs from infringing on the good, honest, copyrighted work made passionately by millions of artists.
