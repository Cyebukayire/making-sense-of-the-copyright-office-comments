I am a person who&#39;s been uploading her creative work for seven years now and I feel that generative AI means a death of human creativity. I see at least one AI art piece on social media a day and it gets so much more engagement then actual artwork. Then, there&#39;s an actual strike for the writers and how can you not pay attention to that? As generative AI gets better, more and more creatives are put out of jobs. I&#39;ve seen it happen to people at Rayark(Deemo developers). I want to follow a creative path, whether that be music, artwork, or writing. My skills are becoming useless in this capitalistic hellscape and there isn&#39;t much I know I could do about it.
