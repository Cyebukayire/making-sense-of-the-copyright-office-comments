I think the use of artificial intelligence is unethical with where it is right now. Ai artists leeching off the art of others to fuel their databases, it feels disrespectful to use other artists&#39; work without their consent. Such as is when ai artists claim that it requires work when all it is, is like a person commissioning another artist. They are not the artist; the ai is. Even though it can be very useful for artists to use I feel like the way it is now is just way too unethical.
