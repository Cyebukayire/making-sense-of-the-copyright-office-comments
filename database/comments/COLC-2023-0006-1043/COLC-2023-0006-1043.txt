I believe that AI generated content should be trained on a database of images, videos, text, or other data licensed by the creator(s) with paid royalties for each time it&rsquo;s used in a generated artwork, for AI training. This license should be revocable by the artist at any time. AI generated content in general should be regulated to be used as a tool rather than the content itself &mdash; an example being that while an AI-generated prompt may be used to begin writing a story, the story itself may not be sold as written by a human if it has been generated without human intervention.
