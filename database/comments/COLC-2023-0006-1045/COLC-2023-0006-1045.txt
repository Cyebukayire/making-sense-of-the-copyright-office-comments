AI should absolutely be regulated. Not only is the application more often used to copy others, but the approach it takes is using content and/or voices without the consent of the owner to create copies any way the AI user wants. And despite being clear it is not legitimate and instead AI, the user of the AI will pass it off as their own work without even considering that they had to use other content and refuse to stop even when approached by the people they took it from, making it impossible to punish them or stop them from stealing the work of others.
