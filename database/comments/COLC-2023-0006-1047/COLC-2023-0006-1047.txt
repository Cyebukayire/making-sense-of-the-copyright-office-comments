I do not like AI and I do not want it to be able to be copyrighted. AI is only good in theory because it&rsquo;s being used by greedy people. People have used it to steal the work of others (for example, Jane Friedman, an author who found AI made work on Amazon under her name that she hadn&rsquo;t written). It&rsquo;s hard enough to make a living as an artist and now people have to compete with AI too. Additionally, film companies shouldn&rsquo;t own the right to make an actor do whatever they want in AI after only paying the actor for one day of work. If AI is going to be allowed, laws need to be extremely strict so that artists don&rsquo;t suffer while CEOs get richer.
