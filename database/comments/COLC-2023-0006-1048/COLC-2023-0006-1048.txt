AI represents great possibilities for creation, but also great possibilities for essentially theft. Theoretical scenarios where AI is trained to copy a specific artist&#39;s style, or used to cut corners on the costs of hiring real works could easily create a world where real humans could be priced out of creating art. I sincerely hope we remember that we need real humans creating art to imbue true emotion, intent, and beauty in the works, and our lives.
