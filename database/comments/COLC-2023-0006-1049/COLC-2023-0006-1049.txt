<br/>I draw as a hobby. <br/><br/>1)Pros: Things are easier. Easier to visualize. It can be difficult to translate whats in my brain to paper.<br/>Cons: People see what I have drawn, say &quot;i want to draw exactly that.&quot; and then do it by putting it in a generating ai, and then they say they made it. I want to be clear: no artist learns how to do things on their own. every one of us has copied others, traced, used references, used how-to guides, etc., to learn how to draw. But NEVER have we said &quot;I want to draw exactly that,&quot; and drew exactly that and then said that we made that. Because what comes out is never an exact copy. We say &quot;we made that,&quot; because we put our labor and experience into it. Do you know the famous motorcycle slide from Akira? It shows up often enough in other anime&#39;s that there&#39;s 2 minute videos that have just that scene from different anime&#39;s and it&#39;s very clear where the team drew inspiration from. One might argue that that&#39;s what those who use AI does, is take a scene and make it&#39;s own, but I disagree.<br/>When you commission someone, you&#39;re not paying for just the materials, you&#39;re paying for the labor and the experience. The years of study, of developing, of learning. People who use AI are only &quot;paying&quot; for the materials. They see a &quot;material&quot; (an art piece), say &quot;I want that,&quot; and then take the &quot;material.&quot; <br/>WAIT, I have a better analogy and also explains why artists are so pissed. Imagine you are at an art gallery, selling your art. You have worked very hard over the years to develop your craft (or maybe not, maybe you just started, because this analogy works anyway). Someone comes up to you and says, &quot;I like your art! I would like to buy it.&quot; You say, &quot;Of course!&quot; and you think nothing more of it. Until the next art gallery, where you see the fellow you sold your piece to, swith a painting that looks awfully familiar saying he painted it. There&#39;s new lines and colors and as you look longer at it you realize that that is the painting you made! <br/>Here is why the artist is so mad: first, the buyer painted over the painter painting. That is a huge taboo. You don&#39;t DO that. I remember there was this universally hated art professor at college that went &quot;do this instead,&quot; and painted over the students painting. Every artist who heard that story was scandalized. And you ESPECIALLY don&#39;t do that and say that &quot;you made it.&quot; <br/>Which brings me to my second point on why the artist was so mad: That was still their painting. The buyer hadn&#39;t set up a new canvas and painted from that, or traced it with tracing paper then painted. If the buyer had done that, the artist would have probably been less pissed. Even if the person had added new lines and colors and shapes, the inspiration of their painting would still be there (maybe very clearly a copy or trace, which is irritating for sure), but they, the buyer, did in fact, make it. No, instead the buyer used what was already done, built off that, and said they made it. Even in science, math, and literature, when they build off each other they never say they did it all on their own! The bibliographies can be so long. <br/>Speaking of, if someone took a paper, changed things enough but not enough to be a new paper, credited the original author in the bibliography, that&#39;s still plagiarism. In fact, that&#39;s how I think AI and art should be approached. Is the art changed enough to be a new piece? There&#39;s one person I know, I believe they&#39;re called ink-the-artist who will use AI in this way. They even change the AI after it&#39;s been generated; it&#39;s derivative enough that it&#39;s a new piece.<br/>Also, you can apply the Art Galley Analogy elsewhere too. <br/><br/>Authors: Sure, you can have this book. Oh, I see you wrote your own book--Wait, that&#39;s my writing! The story is the same, the style and tone are the same, all you&#39;ve done is change setting and characters!<br/><br/>Actors: Sure, you can film me! Oh, I see you&#39;ve made a new movie--wait that&#39;s me! That&#39;s my face, you&#39;ve added glasses and a mustache!<br/><br/>9)Opt in, easy. Know why? Because when it&#39;s &quot;opt out,&quot; companies, platforms, websites, whatever, will pull &quot;you have 30 days to opt out,&quot; (see etsy and their &#39;arbitration opt-out&#39; but barely tell anyone about it), make it so unnecessarily difficult to opt out (see &#39;trying to opt out of data sharing cookies on like, a thousand websites, usually cooking ones or magazines), or pull both (see etsy again). Frankly, I do not trust companies, platforms, etc. to have their users best interest in mind when it&#39;s easier for them and they get more money selling the &#39;training materials.&#39;<br/><br/>15)Yes. Helps accountability.<br/><br/>16)Same as when you see someone repost your art. <br/><br/>28)I&#39;d prefer it, but like in the way people say &#39;I use X tool for Y purpose.&quot;<br/><br/>31)Yes, get on the ball now. This isn&#39;t going away.
