As an artist and lover of traditional media, AI is an insult to my efforts. Wr already as artists of every stripe struggle against capitalist interest that value speed over vision, profit over humanity. To have such hollow images take from us what we have spent years, decades of our lives earning is just absolutely inconceivable. The credit and monetary gain was already minescule and my artists never even make the attempt because of how much income is linked to our survival. To allow corporations crush our aspirations further in the name of profit is cruelty I never thought I&#39;d ever see exist. <br/><br/>I find it heart breaking. AI images are an insult to humanity as a whole and devastating to those of us who dream of sharing our art and making a living off our efforts. Please do what&#39;s right for our dignity, what&#39;s right for humanity. Inact laws that prevent AI from being more than what it is, hollow effortless spam that people are using like snake pil to make quick profit at the expense of the gullible. Do the right thing in spite of corporate interest, for the sake of our well being as a species. I am begging you please.
