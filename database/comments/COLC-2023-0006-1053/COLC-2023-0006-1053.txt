AI &ldquo;Art&rdquo; or any derivative of it should not be allowed to be copyrighted. AI generated images are amalgamations of content that is not original, and as such the content itself should not be able to be copyrighted as it infringes on the original creators content. Similar to how content created by nonhuman entities (such as the famous photo of a monkey who took a picture of itself) Ai should be interpreted in the same fashion. Ai generated content is not original, nor transformative enough ti qualify for copyright
