I believe that work generated by AI cannot have a copywrite belonging to any one individual or organization that generated it. This is analagous to say that I own the headlines resulting from a google search because I told the engine what to generate. Furthermore I believe that since the countless individuals whose work went into &quot;feeding&quot; the ai cannot be properly credited, the work should be public domain. Any individual or organization who is found extracting monetary gain from an ai that they did not create should be fined.
