The end products of generative AI processes should not be copyrightable as they are not produced by humans. Even with prompts, we&#39;re essentially dealing with very sophisticated MadLibs - while human input may be used to include specific variables or parameters, both the content and the structure of generative AI products are created by algorithmic processes, not human ones.<br/><br/>All generative AI products, and their derivatives, should be mandated to include some metadata that includes, at a minimum: a statement that it was in full or in part created by AI processes and the name of the model or program that generated it. This metadata should be replicated in plain text on any host (in the case of a digital file) or in print (in the case of a physical object, like an AI generated image printed in a book). While this isn&#39;t a complete solution, if coupled with legislation that holds non-compliant hosts and publishers accountable for any claims or disputes, it&#39;s setting a foundational baseline for handling this kind of product.<br/><br/>Owners of generative AI models and processes should be required to only train on public domain content, copyright free content, and content where the human authors have explicitly opted in to offer specific works for use in the models. Owners should have a publicly visible list of all such works that is linked to, at a minimum, from the user-facing tools and/or interfaces. Owners should be held liable for any infringement, including using copyrighted human produced works without express permissions.
