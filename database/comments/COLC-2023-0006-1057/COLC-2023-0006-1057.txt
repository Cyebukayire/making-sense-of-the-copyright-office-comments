AI is not a creation of a human person, it is a creation of a machine with variable outcomes based on other peoples hard work. AI is not ORIGINAL work, it is work that has been patched together by studying Thousands of works, works that Other People have created and have the right to copyright. AI has no place in any sector when it concerns creating a copyright. It&#39;s ridiculous. It completely disregards human rights as writers, artists, programmers. I can see where it would be useful to have a jumping off point, but you SHOULD NOT be able to copyright and profit off of a computer-generated work. It would saturate the market with an outstanding amount of mediocre work. The people who create art&ndash;or other mediums such as programming or even textbook writing&ndash;and the tedious process that they work their Lives for, AI would disenfranchise these people. It would truly be a loss for human creation and independence, individuality and uniqueness. Please don&#39;t let passion for individual creation die a gentrified death.
