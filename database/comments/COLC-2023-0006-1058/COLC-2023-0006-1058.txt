Hello, my name is October and I am writing because it is my strong belief that AI is actively harmful to all visual media creators who put their art online (now essentially the only way for an artist to be successful). Please protect visual artists and creators, AI is not a replacement for human creativity and should not be allowed to even attempt to do so.
