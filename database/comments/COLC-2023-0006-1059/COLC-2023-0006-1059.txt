AI content is created from the (usually stolen) input of other images and text related to the ideal end product. It is an amalgamation of random other works that are recognized as similar to whatever input is received, and should be viewed as IP theft. Any services that contribute images or text to AI should be strictly opt-in, and any pool of resources being tapped by said AI should be limited to whatever has been marked as OK to use. If AI content is able to be copyrighted, the copyright should be attributed to the AI engine itself. People inputting prompts into bots should be seen as commissioners, if anything, and any work produced has not been created by them.
