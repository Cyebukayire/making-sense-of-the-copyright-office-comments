I have strong concerns about AI and copyright. I&#39;ve yet to encounter a generative AI that had not trained off of the stolen work of writers/artists. As a writer, this is unsettling and disheartening and I believe that in the long run it will be a great detriment on the production of art and literature, eroding creativity and greatly diminishing the diversity of thought and opinion. Any work created by an AI that was trained on copyrighted works should be considered plagiarism and no works created by AI should be copyrightable.
