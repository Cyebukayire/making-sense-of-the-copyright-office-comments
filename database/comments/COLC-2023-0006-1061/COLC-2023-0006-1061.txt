In my professional opinion as an artist and animator, AI programs and AI produced content should not be allowed to be used for monetary gain, if the AI was trained on copyrighted works. If it was trained only on public domain work, then people should be allowed to profit from it. But if they are using copyrighted works without gaining permission from the owner of the copyright prior to it&#39;s use, then it should only be used for non-profit means.
