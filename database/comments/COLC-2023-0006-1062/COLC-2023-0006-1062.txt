While regulating new tools is important, caution is to be exercised not to hinder the progress or science and technology. There are many A.I. algorithms (GANs, Diffusion, etc.) and each should be taken with a different approach as each differ in the ways of processing copyrighted data. Consider a GAN for example. A GAN(Generative Adversial Network) consists of two separate entities of A.I. each trying to fool the other; The Generator generates what it thinks is images (often referred to the &quot;bill forger&quot; or &quot;student&quot;) and the Discriminator tries to discriminate between human art and images generated by the Generator. (often referred to as the &quot;cop&quot; or &quot;teacher&quot;) The goal of the Generator is fooling the Discriminator; generating images that the Discriminator cannot discriminate with human art. The GAN is a notable example because only one of the entities, the Discriminator, has access to copyrighted content; the Generator does not have access to the copyrighted content at all; just the Discriminator&#39;s responses telling it that it either passed - or didn&#39;t pass - the discrimination test. The entiry that is shipped for service, for customers to generate images off of, is the Generator; the entity that is not under influence of the copyrighted content. As I have demonstrated in the example; each A.I. algorithm must be regulated differently concerning copyright because each algorithm processes copyrighted works differently. This is the standard in many other laws; regulations differ for a truck, a passenger vehicle and a motorcycle despite them all stemming from automobile technology; it should be for different algorithms of A.I. as well.
