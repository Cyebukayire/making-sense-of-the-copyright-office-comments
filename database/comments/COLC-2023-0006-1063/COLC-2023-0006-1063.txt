While the future of AI is in many ways exciting, in its current iteration, AI tends to take massive amounts of data where ever it may be found. While social media and cloud-based storage (such as Google Drive) may have terms and conditions that technically allow the company owners use of content producers works, these are often written in a predatory manner, where even lawyers may have trouble untangling legalese, let alone an average citizen. As a result, many AI generated pieces are an amalgamation of works that are subject to copyright, but the generators are certainly not asking owners for permission to use. AI is generative in a certain sense, but not a meaningful one. It is merely an algorithm applied to a dataset.
