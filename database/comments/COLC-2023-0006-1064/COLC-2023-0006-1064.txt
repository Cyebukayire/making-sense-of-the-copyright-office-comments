Hello, My name is Kelly and I&#39;m a Set Designer/Production Designer and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. Ethics has not caught up to the point where technology can be properly regulated and controlled. This means that people who have less then savory intentions would literally do ANYTHING for money. This extends but is not limited to using dead people&#39;s likenesses and voices, using stolen artwork and claiming it as their own using unregulated and non-consented art as a basis for the code&#39;s data library. It is STEALING work. and the peoples who&#39;s hands its in DO NOT CARE. I implore you to regulate and look at this closely before it completely gets out of hand. thank you.
