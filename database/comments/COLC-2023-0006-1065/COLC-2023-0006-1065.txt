AI generated works are the culmination of unwilling and disrespectful use of others&rsquo; creative work and labor, made into an end product by an algorithm that actively ignores existing copyright, consent, or any attempt at original thought. By nature, AI is not generating new content or work through its own merit or the merit of those using it, but by the theft of existing work, which those who use AI know and willfully participate in a system of theft. Granting legitimacy to AI actively damages the merit of copyright and artistic regulations themselves, as they render them moot and malleable under the thin guise of &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; and &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo;. AI is not true intelligence, as it lacks the ability to create a new idea without theft, the autonomy to utilize that idea to enrich others, or the wisdom to respect those whose work it derives its entire existence from. AI work being legitimized in any form opens the doors to rampant abuses of not only copyright, but labor, personal identity, honest work, and the rightful employment and respect of human intelligence and creativity.
