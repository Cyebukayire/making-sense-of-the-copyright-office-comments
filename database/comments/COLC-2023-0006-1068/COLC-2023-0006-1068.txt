I am Japanese.<br/>In Japan, there is still no concrete proposal for regulation of generative AI, and at the same time, people who want to promote it have been gathering together for more than half a year to discuss in vain, with no intention of promoting regulation.<br/>Generative AI is not even artificial intelligence.<br/>It is a technology that unilaterally exploits copyrights, intellectual property, and culture.<br/>I believe that the technology of generative AI has no development potential and what comes after is destruction and looting.<br/>Copyright is an issue that concerns culture, art, and entertainment in all countries, and I am greatly concerned that different policies in different countries will lead to cultural decline and increased discrimination.<br/>We want to promote innovative companies. I understand that sentiment. But what is waiting for us beyond that innovation? No company can give us concrete examples.<br/>What can we call innovation in free-riding on the rights of others, extorting the rights of others, and trying to profit from the property of others?<br/>In response to the U.S. government&#39;s request for public comments, I, as a Japanese, ask you to<br/>Please regulate generative AI. And please take a strong stand so that other countries will have to follow suit.<br/>Please protect our culture and art.<br/><br/>I strongly urge the generative AI companies to normalize their datasets and strongly regulate their use.<br/>I. Reconstruction of datasets with only out-of-copyright works and licensed data.<br/>II Establishment of a method to return the data to the authors.<br/>III Obligation to clearly state that the data set is made by generated AI<br/>ⅣAssume responsibility for recovery related to data dissemination<br/>V Prohibition of providing unauthorized reproduction of data from the local environment<br/>Ⅵ Establishment of a strict examination body for copyright infringement
