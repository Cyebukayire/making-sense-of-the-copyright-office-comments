AI/machine learning models should be comprehensively prevented from making use of public access or otherwise copyrighted material. Anything that was created by someone else, even if posted publicly, that is used for learning is outright theft. Additionally, no content created by any model that made use of outside sources (that is, sources of content outside of the copyright/IP of the person using the model) should under no circumstances be allowed to be copyrighted. It is definitionally an amalgam of unique experiences from individuals and groups and for it to belong to any one person or organization is, at its most basic, theft of life, if not of experience.
