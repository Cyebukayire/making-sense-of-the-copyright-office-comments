I am a writing teacher at a university in the Boston area, and I have always impressed upon my students that when they use information from another source, it should be attributed, because it is a sign of respect to the original author whose words or ideas they are using. For my students, this is a simple matter; they find useful information from another source, and they tell everyone who reads their essay where it came from. We do this because the work they are using is not theirs. Now fortunately, since they are using it for non-profit and educational purposes, there is no need to purchase the rights to this information, but the point still stands, they must credit the work because it is not theirs. Instead, we value the work that they create themselves, through their work and development of skill. The work that they create belongs to them, and may not be used by someone else. Even in a simple situation of me, the teacher, wanting to use their anonymous work as a sample for other students, I must ask for permission, because the work belongs to them. This is all to say, that we are teaching our students that the work they create is theirs, and the work belonging to someone else is not and must be accredited. With AI, we are seeing algorithms that use other people&#39;s work without permission, and create new works without attribution. These machines are not creating anything, and the humans putting in the prompt for the algorithm to generate information are not creating anything either. There doesn&#39;t seem to be any reason why something created by AI could be copyrighted since none of it is credited work.
