The copyright should be held by the original source content makers when the source is not chosen by the AI end user and any existing content is used to produce the resulting content. Such as asking for a type of image and being given modified images they made no part of.  Or using text to make new text.  Copyright should be extended in parallel to an original source when a computer extrapolates and makes new content off of the AI end used original source.  Such as a painter using their own image under AI or someone asking for modifications to writing.  Copyright should be extended to the AI end user where a model learns what something looks like mathematically and generates something new without using any pre-existing content.
