The core of copyright is to allow creators to do their jobs without fear of someone stealing their work. A great deal of AI art has already been derived from works copied without permission; effectively, stolen artwork. This technology cannot be ethically used to generate art in its current iteration. Theoretically, the only way to use AI art would be to limit its models to art specifically intended for that purpose. Even then, the highly replicable nature of AI makes it a technology that is especially prone to misuse in that manner. So practically speaking, AI is not a technology that can reliably respect the spirit of copyright protections, and therefore should never be subject to such protections.
