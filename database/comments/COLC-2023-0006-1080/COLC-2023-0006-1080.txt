&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; programs (really, they&#39;re just machine learning programs) should not be considered protected by copyright. They take samples of others&#39; work without permission to train on them, and they exacerbate already-present biases such as racism, sexism, and ableism. Without permission from original creators to use their work in the training process, it is indistinguishable from theft. It would be like cutting off pieces of famous artists&#39; work as a reference, then pasting them together to make something &quot;original.&quot; <br/><br/>In essence, machine learning is not creation of original content. It has already been shown to be fallible, inconsistent, and potentially dangerous (see the examples of lawyers&#39; audits due to referencing nonexistent cases, as produced by a machine learning program). Artists have had to develop programs of their own to protect their own work from being scraped by these programs and sampled without their permission (Glaze in particular comes to mind). Still more artists (of all types of digital media) are afraid of sharing any of their art online due to the risk of machine learning programs using it and reproducing it without their permission.<br/><br/>In a word, it is plagiarism. Anything protected by copyright - original work from creators of different media - should have the right to their work being protected from theft and plagiarism, and these machine learning programs are no exception.
