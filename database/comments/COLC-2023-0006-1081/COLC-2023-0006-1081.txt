I believe it should be unlawful to train AI on material you may not have copyright for. If my writing or artwork is read by the AI, and the AI then produces a product, then I have had a hand in creating that product, however small - but I will receive no compensation for my work. In fact, given the sheer mass amounts of data required to train AI, it would be nearly impossible to compensate everyone who contributed to its training, and to any products made with it. AI works MUST NOT be allowed to be made or sold for any kind of profit whatsoever. It is unethical, and it violates my freedoms and protections as an American. Furthermore, the use of this technology to replace human journalists, artists, writers, graphic designers, etc - takes jobs away from hardworking Americans with degrees and puts them in the hands of sweatshops overseas. It allows bad faith actors to use the work of those Americans to make a profit without compensating anyone except sweatshops overseas. It is bad for the economy and it erodes trust in the government because we can never be sure anything we see has been made by real human hands. Do not allow AI to produce CGI, movie posters, DVD box art, album covers, news articles, novels, comics, illustrations, graphic designs, etc - that may be used to help make a profit. AI should not be allowed to design so much as a the back of a cereal box if the people who contributed to that AI&#39;s training cannot be fairly compensated for their work. It is disrespectful to Americans, to God, and to humanity for the law to allow outright thievery to go unpunished.
