Material produced by a model should only be copyrightable if it can be demonstrated that the model was only trained on materials in the public domain, released with a permissive license (e.g. Creative Commons), or acquired explicitly for training from the copyright holder (e.g. by purchasing a license). It follows that material generated from training data that adheres to these restrictions could then be used to train future models that output copyrightable materials. &quot;I found it on the Internet&quot; is not sufficient; such materials can be scraped after being illegally uploaded or without verifying that permission has been or would be granted for such use.<br/><br/>Individuals or companies that cannot demonstrate that their training data is properly sourced should not be given a free pass simply because the scale is too daunting, tracking provenance is expensive, or the original copyright holder of a particular material cannot be identified. &quot;Show your work&quot; is a standard that humans have to adhere to and it should be no different once that work is being done by one or more machines.
