A.I. is meant to be a tool to assist people not to replace jobs. Any company or individual solely putting the work on A.I. has no claim to the output. Just because a nailgun does not replace the job of a hammer. Both require a user to do the work. A.I. as being used now by individuals and companies are ignoring the grit of humankind. <br/>Tools should be used not abused. <br/>Even if people want to play semantics of an A.I. being sentient to be on par with humans, thus gaining the right to copyright. In the far off future if that A.I. is that sentient. It would own the rights, not the person who programmed it. At that point the programmer would be a parent or teacher. The individual or company cannot take their work and sell it off. <br/>Bringing this back down to the current time and reality. A.I. is a tool not valid work. You can make a recipe, you can claim top be the original creator, but you cannot own the components. You cannot copyright the idea of dicing tomatoes it&#39;s not a unique idea, but is part of the process. Just as using A.I. is not unique or original, but can assist any process. The end result should be more than just the some of its parts, and A.I. is just a part.
