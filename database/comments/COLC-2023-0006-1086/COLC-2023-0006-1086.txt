All AI-Generated works should have MANDATORY watermarks or similar signatures that inform viewers that what they are viewing is computer-generated material. <br/><br/>Social media should be required to create labels to apply to posts that contain computer-generated material, and a report function for computer-generated material that is not properly marked as such. <br/><br/>&quot;AI&quot; generated works should automatically be public domain. They are literally being trained on the unwilling, unknowing public, therefore it should be the public that owns the creations scraped from its works as a whole. <br/><br/>All published works should be automatically, legally protected from AI data scraping. <br/><br/>Anyone found scaping the protected data should be fined heavily and their works made public domain or revert to the creators whose works they scraped.<br/><br/>Those who specifically wish to allow AI training should have an opt-in option to allow data scraping-- protection from AI scraping should be the DEFAULT. <br/><br/>Accounts and persons distributing deepfake imagery, especially revenge porn or political misinformation should face jail time and heavy financial fines, at minimum. <br/><br/>As I said before, all AI-generated material should have a required watermark. Accounts who remove watermarks to pass AI generated content off as &quot; the real deal&quot; / true events should face various penalizations depending on the severity of what they are posting. <br/><br/>I have already encountered scams online of people generating images of nonexistant plants to sell junk seeds for astronomical prices, usually targeting the elderly.
