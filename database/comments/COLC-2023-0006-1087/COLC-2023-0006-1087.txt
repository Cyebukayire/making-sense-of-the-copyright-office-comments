AI, like most things humans create, is not inherently evil or bad. However, it IS inherently flawed, biased, and undiscerning. As it exists today, all it&rsquo;s doing is ripping people off, and stealing jobs. Machine learning is meant to take over menial tasks, not steal art from artists. I strongly think that at this juncture, AI produced content should NOT be copywritable. It should not be considered a source of fact, as we have seen the steep decline in reliability from Chat GPT. And I think we should start teaching new kinds of media and internet literacy in schools, so kids can start to be aware of the false info that surrounds them, and how to parse it out. Thank you.
