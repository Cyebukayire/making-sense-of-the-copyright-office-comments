Hello, and thank you for taking public comment at this time. I am a public librarian, and a life long lover of story, both of which contribute to my reverence for and respect of authors and their work. The more I think about AI, the more it feels like art galleries contracting directly with paint a paint recycler, and selling canvases uniformly covered in that brownish greyish mess that you dared your friend to make his hot lunch one time in elementary school. Is there paint on the canvas? Sure, but even the smallest amounts of human agency and choice that went into making the work were made by others. Paint companies who design colors, landlords and homeowners and renters who choose what to paint, and the further subset of same who are conscientious enough to remember to recycle. They&#39;re contributions are neglible, in aggregate, but they are the ones doing the creating, not the giant mixer at the recycling center, not the art gallery who wants you to pay for...slop.<br/><br/>To answer your questions:<br/>1.The risks of this technology are already becoming apparent. AI is unable to fact check itself, and AI companies have demonstrated no interest in fixing this horrifying gap, and are already gleefully wriggling out of any responsibility for errors this causes. It harms creators because of the ways AI is operated as a black box. You aren&#39;t allowed to know if your own copyrighted work has been fed into the algorithm and are therefore unclear how much of what it has produced is a derivative work. Probably more than it should be, but how are you to know how much you&#39;ve been ripped off?<br/><br/>2. i am especially horrified by the ways in which AI muddies media literacy for my library patrons, as the digital divide has already made navigating the modern world a terrifyingly daunting place as it is. There was a post on social media recently where a chat AI declared categorically that there were no countries in Africa that start with K. In the same sentence, it used the example of Kenya to illustrate the....lack of K countries. I am loathe to experience my first reference interview with a member of the public who has been convinced that AI is a good source of information or advice. How do I explain how it works, why it&#39;s a bad idea, to somebody I taught rudimentary email navigation to last month?<br/><br/>I have learned enough from copyright librarians to know that I don&#39;t know enough to meaningfully contribute to the questions 3-8.<br/><br/>As for question 9, I believe that opt in is vital to make AI companies respect the copyright of others, but I wonder how you could test or prove what has and hasn&#39;t been used. There has been a lot of discussion in fan fiction spaces about ChatGPT&#39;s familiarity with the terminology from more obscure sub sub genres of fanfiction indicating that fan archives were scraped, but how are you to know beyond that? <br/><br/>From the questions you have come up with, I get the sense that you are all thinking very carefully about this, for which I am grateful. I am of the opinion that most all programming should be a licensed profession, akin to engineering, so while I am in favor of vastly more regulation and failsafing, I understand what a monumental undertaking that would be. Marcel Duchamp was a surrealist artist and total prick who is famous for defining art as &quot;an artist chooses, and signs.&quot; I encountered one of his pieces, a hardware store bought snow shovel at the Yale Art Museum, and it infuriated me. Not for the fact that it counted as art, but because Duchamp metaphorically peeing on that particular shovel is what made it ART. Not the person who designed it, the person who approved that design, not the fabricator who assembled it, but the Great Man. I understand all of the dadaist implications and choices, the Yoko Ono esque concept of directions to create performance art, but I still see a person who wants to make fun of the art world pretension while also punching down at the person and the company who makes urinals. Who sees craft and mass production as an excuse to appropriate and self aggrandize. Is that damned shovel or that stupid urinal art? Yes, but not because of Duchamp, but because of the Sears Company, because of Mr. R. Mutt, and because of those unnameable and uncountable workers who Duchamp stole from. But their authorship was in each case, such a tiny negligible snippet that they don&#39;t and won&#39;t get the credit. If you&#39;d like, I&#39;d point to the comic an artist made about how he feels about Lichtenstein lifting his comic art whole cloth and making millions off it. https://comicsalliance.com/russ-heaths-comic-about-being-ripped-off-by-roy-lichtenstein-will-give-you-a-new-appreciation-for-the-hero-initiative/<br/><br/>AI does even less conscious choosing and point of view creation than Duchamp and Lichtenstein, while stealing more, and from more people. It&#39;s reprehensible to think that it could be copyrighted.
