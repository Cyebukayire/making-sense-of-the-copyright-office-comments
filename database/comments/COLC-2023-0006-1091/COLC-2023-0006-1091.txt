AI can only be trained upon the work of others. <br/>As it stands, most training has come from either direct theft of others creative work, low-paying purchase of content.<br/><br/>Just like actors likenesses have worth and value, so does an artist&#39;s work, even if the art they have created is &quot;fan art&quot; or for fun. AI/Text-to-Speech can steal and actors entire livelihood, and bigger business are taking advantage of the lack of protections in regards to AI to get as much underhanded things done as quickly as they can. Please refer to the &quot;Central Casting&quot; drama ongoing on Twitter, in which Central Casting is requiring users to give them full access to sell ANYTHING they do, submit, or create. <br/><br/>On TikTok, one can find many &quot;AI VOICE COVERs&quot; of people who did not give consent to have their voice cloned and stolen, often by a company called &quot;ElevenLabs&quot;. Users can submit voice samples for this website to create a voiceprint that can then be used without the original actor&#39;s knowledge or permission. This is theft, and can be used to damage one&#39;s livelihood. If for example, a company saw a voice cover of a rap song with explicit lyrics, they could easily choose to fire or not use that actor for something completely out of their control. Some people are even STEALING THE VOICES OF DEAD ACTORS, for fun. How crude and immoral this is.<br/><br/>A FACE, VOICE, ART PIECE and WRITING are all a type of LIKENESS. <br/>The voice must become legally listed as a form of likeness to protect the livelihood of actors. Consecutively, ElevenLabs and other AI/TTS companies must be made to stop accepting voice files of people without permission. <br/><br/>We as actors request that an option of legal recourse be given for the damage to our livelihoods by this theft.
