AI has been used far more than is necessary in recent time. Impersonation, theft of intellectual property, plagiarism, and even robbing artists of their work. As it is now, AI is too free and if left to its devices, will become too big to stop. It&#39;s already done far too much damage, and as the programs get better, it will only get worse. Using AI to impersonate previous presidents is hopefully enough to incentivize action to be taken. These AI are letting people say vicious things with people&#39;s voices, in uncanny ways not previously feasible. The robbing of artists falls in line with the IP theft, by training these AI on artists&#39; work, it harms their livelihood by taking away customers, and on larger scales has forced some artists to retire. And on top of that, AI are being used by students to write essays and assignments for them, not only stealing words from other sources, but also being blatantly wrong. There are too many issues with AI as it stands, and it can not be left free as it WILL escalate.
