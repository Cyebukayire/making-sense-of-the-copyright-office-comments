Good day, I firmly believe artificial intelligence or AI systems and companies should operate on a strict opt-in only system, with exception for works in the public domain. This would allow anyone interested in exploring the technology to do so without infringing upon or offending those who do not. Such a system ought to make it very clear what the intention of the system and its designers is and should allow easily accessible options for revocation of the work which would be used to train such a system. AI systems which freely scrape data from the open internet for training are dangerous and irresponsible because it is unethical to incorporate data which has not been granted the consent to be used for a myriad of reasons such as autonomy and financial compensation if the AI is used for profit. It is also dangerous because AI systems are not built with morality, responsibility, or truthfulness and can generate false information that an uninformed user may take for truth. This can lead to dangerous behavior. If opt-in is not adhered to, it must fall on the company which owns and maintains the system to be responsible for what the AI generated because there is no way to punish a computer. We must take this moment very seriously and ensure that traceability and responsibility are built into these systems so that there is a clear line of fault if some malicious action is taken as a result of AI generation. Otherwise it poses a risk to security and the rule of law in many parts of life, given how much the internet is a part of daily life in the 21st century.
