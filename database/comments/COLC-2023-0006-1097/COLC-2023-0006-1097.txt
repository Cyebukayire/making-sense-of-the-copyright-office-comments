As someone who is a freelance artist, I detest the idea of my artwork being used to train an AI model without first being asked and provided recompense or perhaps even royalties as any other artist might. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m a music producer and someone uses my work in their movie, obviously they would have to seek clearance to use my music as a part of their creation. I work for patrons who commission my work for their personal use, the transaction is between me and them, at no point is the AI part of the monetary transaction in this. Additionally, I make art for explicitly non-commercial purposes as well as commercial purposes. If a non-commercial piece of mine is being used for commercial activity against my will, I should be able to do something about that.<br/><br/>I should make it clear that I&#39;m not opposed to AI art, I think it has genuine applications for stuff where you both want an art piece but don&#39;t have the money. I think corporations should be allowed to do it, provided they pay for the rights to use all of the images they train their AI on. <br/><br/>Of course there&#39;s the question of whether AI should be able to hold copyright. I don&#39;t think so, the AI can only create what it already knows. Which, while true to some extent with humans, we can draw on external stimuli to alter this. I think if the AI could draw on external stimuli beyond just images, then there might be more for me to give thought to, but as it stands it&#39;s just collage work without rhyme or reason. Collage work is, in some ways, similar to what these AI do, but it&#39;s usually made plain that it&#39;s a collage. Collage works have soul to them, they make commentary from their parts and transform them into something new and different. AI just... doesn&#39;t have that power to do so on its own.
