Any further limitations on Fair Use would be bad. Copyrighting artstyles would be awful. Artists need a thriving public domain, and copyright law is not the hammer which should be used to strike here. Any expansions to copyright law only benifit major corperations, and would hurt independant artists terribly.<br/><br/>Non-consentual inclusion of private infomation in datasets should be handled by expanding online privacy laws, rather than copyright law. It always should have been a privacy issue, and never a copyright issue.<br/><br/>AI generated works being public domain should be explicitly codified into the law. Standards should also be created for what constitutes &quot;human input&quot;, so corporations don&#39;t find loopholes. It is good for artists and good for AI art to be public domain, and is a major tool to prevent worker exploitation.
