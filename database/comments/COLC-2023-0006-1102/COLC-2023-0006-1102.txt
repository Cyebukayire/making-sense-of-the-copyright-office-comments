AI artwork is, inherently, theft. By training the artificial intelligence off of materials that these companies have not been granted proper permission to use (and are, additionally, not in public domain,) every single creation is produced off of stolen material. AI training networks absolutely must be regulated and restricted for proper adherence to copyright and intellectual property law, in order to protect all artists, writers and actors from having their artwork, writing and voices stolen.
