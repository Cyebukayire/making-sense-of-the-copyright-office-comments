It&#39;s not fair or ethical to allow machine learning to scrape data from works of art whose maker has stated they don&#39;t want to participate as a data point for these software models. Posting on the internet does not entitle people to use the art for their own purposes, especially if it&#39;s to make a profit. It&#39;s imperative that copyright is upheld for freelance artists, not just companies, and if we disregard copyright and allow machinr learning to take data from unwilling artists, this sets a dangerous precident to what we own. Where would we stop it? It&#39;s a downhill slope to identity theft and libel as machine learning improves and gets better at replicating voices, mannerisms, behavior. The potential for harm is massive and cannot be overlooked.
