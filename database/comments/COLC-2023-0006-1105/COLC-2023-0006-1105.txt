Hello,<br/><br/>I firmly believe that AI infringes on the copyrights of certain creative professions and poses risks that could be detrimental to creators everywhere. A few anecdotes on the internet about people having their names attached to work that they clearly did not write or support that was created by AI is actually terrifying as well. I believe that this technology does have its place; however, the creative sphere is not that place. Not to mention that people can maliciously use AI to create false narratives or claim that somebody said something that they never did. It goes beyond basic copyright and almost violates personal privacy in my belief. <br/>In my opinion, AI work cannot be copyrighted as it was not borne from an actual human. It was stolen from the work of somebody else. Their thoughts and creativity and effort is merely boiled down to a cheap imitation done in about 30 seconds. The lack of humanity in AI derived works is an insult to content creation everywhere. We have copyright protections from others to keep our works safe, so why would AI be any different? Unlike taking inspiration from works, AI does not transform it in any way that could be seen as fair use. Please do not allow AI to run rampant in a creative sphere. It runs the risk of destroying so much of humanity.<br/><br/>Thank you.
