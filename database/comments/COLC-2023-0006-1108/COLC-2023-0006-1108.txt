As a writer, editor, and librarian, I am deeply concerned about the push to embrace Artificial Intelligence in publishing and academic circles. Putting aside the ethincs of using such programs in the first place (all of which are build on stealing the work of others to build their databases) they also produced substandard work. The articles written are inaccurate. The artwork generated is inhuman. There is no benefit to utilizing these programs apart from profiting a hand full of companies that are going out of their way to pay their workers a living wage.
