I am a resident of New York state and working creative and I am deeply concerned about the threat to so many livelihoods posed by unregulated AI. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little or no recourse. I would urge the federal government to enact reasonable regulations to protect copyright holders and working creatives from the threat of plagiarism and theft of their work by AI without hindering the innovation of new technology. It is only common sense.
