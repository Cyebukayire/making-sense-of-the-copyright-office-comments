Works that are created by Artificial Intelligence or feature content where Artificial Intelligence played a substantial in the creation of a work should in no way, shape, or form be eligible for copyright as at their very nature they are built on violating copyrights, commit plagiarism in mass, and will be utilized to cull human creativity in favor of corporations reaping profits. It will buy and large kill millions of jobs for Americans in the creative arts/content production professions. Why hire a book cover artist when one could just use Dall-E , type in &quot;Fantasy Romance Book Cover with Sword&quot; and have the AI study and rip off the painstakingly human-created covers of existing books within the genre and churn out something that with a little tweaking by some underpaid contract worker, could make them hundreds of thousands for a nominal cost? Further more, current AI models that are running collect their data from human creators without their consent, and even in the few cases where consent has be given there is no policy in place to insure that those creators are compensated and attributed accordingly for the products AI will churn out from their hard labor. Please, do not allow AI works to be copyrighted.  As you say yourself, the Copyright Office is committed to helping fulfill copyright&rsquo;s Constitutional purpose and to promote creativity and free expression for the benefit of all. Allowing AI in these creative spaces will only benefit one.
