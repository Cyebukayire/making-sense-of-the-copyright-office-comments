Generative artificial intelligence in the current form is entirely dependent on extremely large datasets.  Due to the sheer size of the database needed to train these programs it is typical for their creators to incorporate into their dataset works that they do not have the right to use.  This reason alone is more than enough to condemn the practice, it is unethical to allow the rightfully owned work of a human being to be stolen in this way.  For decades media companies have been railing against online piracy for exactly this reason.  Using AI as an excuse to steal the work of writers, artists and others is no different than that piracy. <br/><br/>Furthermore, outside of the issue of rights, there is the issue of artistic progress as a whole.  Generative AI cannot actually &quot;create&quot; anything, the reason it requires such large datasets is because it can only combine those pieces in different ways.  In other words, generative AI can never come up with anything truly new, it can only rehash that which has been created by humans.  To work in a creative field is already a difficult financial proposition as it is.  If generative AI is allowed to be used without restriction it will further drive down wages in creative industries and correspondingly drive down the progress of all creative pursuits.  In short: it will make art worse.
