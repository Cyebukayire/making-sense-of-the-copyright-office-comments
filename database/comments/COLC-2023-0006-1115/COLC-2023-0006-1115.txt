I don&#39;t believe ANYTHING created with the use of &quot;AI&quot; should be considered copyrightable. There are virtually no rules regulating the training of AI models, which means that most, if not all, of the AIs in existence have used copyrighted materials to train their models, and otherwise use the work of people who have not given their consent for their work/art/writing to be included. These models, which are less actual Artificial Intelligence and more just very advanced Predictive Text, are essentially plagiarism machines. They cannot create original ideas--they can only absorb actual human beings&#39; works and return an amalgamation of these works as an output. Copyright law is meant to protect intellectual property and original works, and there is nothing original nor intellectual about this property, because these models only produce works based on the hard work of other and do not require any intellect or effort to create, other than typing in a few key words into a generator. And even ignoring the ethical issues, opening AI-produced media to copyright would be a nightmare, because AI works are incredibly easy to produce en masse and would result in a flood of potentially millions of copyright requests.<br/><br/>In the US Copyright Office&#39;s own words, copyright is &quot;intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression.&quot; AI works are not original, have no authors (I&#39;d argue vehemently against the idea that the person who inputs a prompt into an AI is an &#39;author,&#39; in the same way that someone who writes a one-sentence youtube comment is not a &#39;writer&#39;), aren&#39;t actually that much more &#39;intellectual&#39; than the predictive text found on cell phone messaging apps, and are incapable of actual, genuine expression. They should NOT be considered eligible for copyright. The copyright office has a time-honored tradition of protecting the amazing things that the human mind is capable of coming up with, and I sincerely hope it continues that tradition and protects the actual human creators that these AI models are leeching off of.
