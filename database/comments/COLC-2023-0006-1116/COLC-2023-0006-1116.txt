AI-generated content is made by stealing the uncompensated creations and likenesses of people who did not consent to their use. Its current state is unethical and should not be allowed copyright or legal protection, as no true human effort was put into what the program generates. Additionally, large studios seek to appropriate the likenesses and performances of actors (both visual and audio) to create content using those actors indefinitely and without paying them, and small artists too have seen their already-dwindling professional opportunities be taken over with false versions of themselves scraped from their existing artwork.<br/><br/>Not only that, unregulated AI creates dangerous opportunities for misinformation (already all over social media, particularly in political circles) and pornography using the likenesses of real people, including children. This is unacceptable and violates the limits of free speech through the harm it causes to real human beings.<br/><br/>This is not a world that anyone should have to live in. I urge you to not only deny copyright to all AI-generated works for the sake of the artists, writers, actors, models, and photographers whose livelihoods depend on the ownership of the things they create, but ban their use in creating misinformation and explicit imagery that target individuals.
