The risks of such technology are vast. The current state of scamming is bad enough, but if AI are able to replicate art, it will be sold as an &ldquo;original,&rdquo; thus falsely advertising a product.<br/>It also essentially steals wages away from creators for copying their work and profiting off of it in some way.<br/>The only way AI generated art should be copyrighted is if all functions were programmed by the original creator.<br/>The original artist should be contacted if there is a desire to use their style or recreate a piece (every time for each piece) and a request should be made. If approved, a detailed record of the transaction/discussion with signature of the original creator should be kept.
