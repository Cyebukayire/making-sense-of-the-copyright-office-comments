To put it simply, AI that builds its dataset using sources it does not have permission to use is stealing. As such, the sources used for any AI should be listed publicly, and the data scraping itself should be heavily regulated. Many human beings, including artists and writers, are already suffering by losing work to AI that has stolen original works. This is not only immoral but could have grievous effects on entire industries from the individual to the megacorporation.
