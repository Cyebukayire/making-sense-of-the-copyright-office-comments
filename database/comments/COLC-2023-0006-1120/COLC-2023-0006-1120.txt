I support regulatory action against AI.<br/><br/>While it can be a useful tool that can help alleviate workflows for many different fields, unchecked it will be exploited to steal from others and cheat people out of work. Already, many of the mainstream AI bots like ChatGPT and Midjourney comb through various art and writing sites, stealing the work of real people. AI is not a person, and therefore cannot create original artwork or writing. It merely learns from the work of others, whether ethically or unethically. It simply does not deserve copyright.
