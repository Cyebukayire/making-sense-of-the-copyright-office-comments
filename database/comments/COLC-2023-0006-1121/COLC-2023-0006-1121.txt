With regards to the usage of copyrighted works in the corpus of an AI program, the process should be considered inherently transformative - if an artist is allowed to sell a collage made out of copyrighted material because we recognize that the final product is a fundamentally unique work compared to what went in to it, then we should recognize that the same applies to an AI work. The output is noticably and demonstrably different than the training data, and thus not an infringement.
