I think AI violates copyright as these programs have to be trained by programmer&#39;s feeding other people&#39;s intellectual property directly into the computer program. What we get as a result is people trying to make money off of programs being told to &quot;create art in the style of x artist&quot; or &quot;write a screenplay in the style of x writer&quot;, something that real human beings could be sued for if they tried to do the same.
