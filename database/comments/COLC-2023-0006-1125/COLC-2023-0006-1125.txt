AI copyright is incredibly important. For an AI system to learn, it has to be fed information from various sources. Often, these sources are copyrighted/personal works created by artists of all kinds, and are typically uncredited or stolen to feed AI learning. AI copyright should absolutely be put in place, with strict regulations. Intellectual property theft is still theft, and often if not always, is what people&#39;s livelihoods depend on. Please, do the right thing and protect intellectual property.
