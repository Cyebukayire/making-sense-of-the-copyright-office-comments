A.I. is trained off of the likeness of others, which is why it has been used to generate life-like imagery of people in sexual situations against their will. A.I. art is, similarly, created by using other people&#39;s art against their will. It cannot be claimed as &quot;an original piece&quot; because it is inherently not original, it is stolen. The &quot;creator&quot; of A.I. art is not a person as it is created by a program, which cannot be treated as a citizen or sentient person would be.  Does the A.I. have paid time off? Does it get holidays and weekends? Does the A.I. make minimum wage? Does the A.I. recieve any enjoyment or pleasure from it&#39;s &quot;creations&quot; at all? Of course not. Because it is not a person, it is not a company, it is not an association, it cannot hold any rights. A stove doesn&#39;t own the a cake recipe. It did not &quot;create&quot; art, it slapped pieces of art together, which is why it often generates signatures and watermarks. A.I. is not a person, company, corporation, non-profit, organization, or any other rights-holding body. It is a machine and cannot, therefore, have rights. The person creating the A.I. itself is a thief, using the work of others without care or transformation. It is not original or parody. It is a mockery of art and should be illegal. If there was any good basis for A.I. to be given rights, it would already have them. Giving it any legitimacy would be devaluing all other copyright laws, by simply handwaving the process of making the A.I., which is teaching it to steal, rip apart, and regurgitate already copyrighted works. An artist painting a woman transforms her image with labor, talent, and time. A.I. requires none of these because it has already stolen them from others.
