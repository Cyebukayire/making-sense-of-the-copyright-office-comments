As a copywriter and actor, AI has the potential to completely hamstring my ability to find work. People using content made by AIs trained on the work of myself and others are already killing my ability to find work that pays. However, this is not where the Copyright Office&#39;s interests lie. <br/><br/>Instead, let&#39;s focus on residuals and royalties. I and many of my colleagues rely on these forms of ongoing payments to make ends meet. In the past several decades, the Copyright Office has extended copyright multiple times after lobbying from Disney and other major corporations to protect their early 20th century properties. If AI is permitted to continue without regulation, these are the only types of organizations who will be able to benefit from extended copyrights, because they will have the resources to fight back. If AI can continue to be used after being trained on copyrighted material, it is the small artists and writers and makers who will suffer most. A human being needs to pay rent and buy food - a computer just needs electricity. Our work is being used against our will to create the very works that will put us out of house and home.<br/><br/>However, it is important to note that simply producing something in the style of another creator cannot be considered a violation of copyright. Artists are inspired by others, and that will continue forever. Think of the likelihood that Disney would start to sue anyone who made kind princesses a focus of their commercially successful work, or that Marvel would start to pursue people who write unique superheroes. It is the AI programs themselves that must be regulated, not creators. <br/><br/>In my opinion, I believe the best way to accomplish this is by requiring AI programs to add a digital stamp to works they create. Additionally, if a work would otherwise be considered copyright infringement under current laws if it had been produced by a human, ownership of the product should be granted to the original creator. Finally, AI works should not be permitted to be copyrighted or sold unless they meet the previous standard of copyright violation.
