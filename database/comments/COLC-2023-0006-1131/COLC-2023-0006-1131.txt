I&rsquo;m not a big fan of AI basically stealing others art and using it to create &ldquo;original AI&rdquo; works. There is nothing original about it, all of the aspects of it have been stolen from others. <br/><br/>In my opinion, AI art should only be created from creators who volunteer up their art for the AI to learn from.
