In relation to AI trying to encroach on any of the arts I don&rsquo;t believe it deserves any copyright. Nothing from AI is original or possesses any soul, not to mention that the way the technology exploits peoples already existing ideas and talents to create its content makes it a never ending lawsuit time after time that it is involved in any release. It robs people of original ideas and basically churns out everything it has already been programmed to know, in other words what true artists with actual talent actually possess. The lack luster, cheap product that AI would produce across the arts is quite frankly not worth the harm it will do to citizens careers, to our economy and to the artists. It is not worthy of any copyright protection in any sense of the word and quite frankly not worthy of being involved in the arts, or any branch of government and so forth it could reach, in general.
