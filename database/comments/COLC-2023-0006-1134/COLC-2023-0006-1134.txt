To whom it may concern,<br/><br/>There has been a recent uproar in the creative communities (art, music, writing, acting, etc) over the unethicality of AI. AI functions by feeding off of creatives&#39; work without any sort of permission, and in the case of writing and drawing &quot;AI&quot;, completely copies these artists&#39; work. In the cases of real people, some people, especially actors, are having multitudes of people using their voices without permission, and sometimes explicit disallowance, to say or sing things they would otherwise not have said. It brings into question if people will ever properly be in charge of what is arguabley the most human thing we&#39;re aware of: the arts.<br/>I think there should be strict copyright guidelines when it comes to AI to protect the rights of artists, writers, musicians, and actors everywhere. No one&#39;s likeness nor creation should be used to &quot;train&quot; these AI without explicit permission from the original creator(s).
