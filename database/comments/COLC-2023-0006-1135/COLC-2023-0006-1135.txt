When it comes down to making creative content via artificial intelligence, we must consider the unauthorized use of copyrighted material and how an AI using the data of copyrighted work differs from a person taking inspiration from said copyrighted work. A person may use copyrighted material as a reference point, creating a unique piece of work via their own labor. Artificial intelligence can similarly create a piece of work based on the copyrighted material, but in order to do so, it needs to add the files of its references to the data set. Afterwards, it creates a piece of work using other people&#39;s labor and the copyright holder&#39;s copyrighted material, taking advantage of their efforts without obtaining the proper rights to the material.<br/><br/>There is also discussion regarding the use of artificial intelligence when all the necessary rights are obtained. In such a situation, the content the AI generates would not infringe on anyone&#39;s rights, but due to the nature of the work, the work itself would not be protected by copyright. Without a person behind the work, the work should not qualify as an original work of authorship or a tangible form of expression.<br/><br/>One more quick note about artificial intelligence being used as a tool to help people create material. As long as a majority of base material is created by a human, the use of artificial intelligence should be seen as acceptable. (An example of this can be an AI filling in-between frames of an animation without the need of a human to create each individual frame, allowing them to focus on the base frames).<br/><br/>In summary, artificial intelligence should follow the guidelines of other media websites (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, etc.). If the creators want to use data sourced from copyrighted material, they should obtain the proper rights to said material. Furthermore, due to the nature of the work, it cannot be considered its own unique form of artistic expression, meaning that any work created by artificial intelligence cannot be copyrighted. If artificial intelligence is used as a support tool for people to create their works, then it should be considered acceptable, since people are doing the majority of the work while the AI helps to simplify the process for the creators.
