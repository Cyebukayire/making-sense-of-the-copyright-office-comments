I fully disagree with the use of Artificial intelligence in any aspect. It&rsquo;s an extreme invasion of a real person&rsquo;s identity. It should not be used in any capacity. These are real human beings who&rsquo;s likenesses are being taken advantage of. The government should 100% step in and outlaw this ASAP. the ramifications of this becoming a normal thing in our world is dangerous.
