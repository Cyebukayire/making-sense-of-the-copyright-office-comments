I am someone who makes traditional art in multiple mediums, physical and digital, as well as someone who has extensively used AI programs to create images. I think you have a unique problem on your hands. If I look at this black-and-white, yes a style isn&rsquo;t copyrighted or protected (and I think it should remain this way) but we get to an interesting place when a style is used as a training method for a technology that will be sold and/or licensed out. We might need to begin to treat individual pieces of artwork like &ldquo;molds&rdquo; rather than how they&rsquo;ve traditionally been viewed. For example- I can&rsquo;t just make a mold of a dice I bought and sell it. But I can make a mold of that dice alter it and then it&rsquo;s fair use. But what about when a machine is involved? What about mechanizing the process of using someone else&rsquo;s work as a base? I think this is a really tough issue and I hope that whoever is making decisions about this considers both the artists and the AI users and it&rsquo;s potential uses. One last interesting parallel I can think of is the mechanization of pottery and glass blowing. It had to be hand made until a certain point - maybe looking into reactions to that could shed some light on this issue I don&rsquo;t know. Good luck, this issue is crazy and divisive and I don&rsquo;t envy you.
