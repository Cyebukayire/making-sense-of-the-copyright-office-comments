As an artist, I have watched the work of my peers taken by people and fed into machines. Those people want to profit off the copyrighted work of other people. Violating copyright is ENDEMIC to the use of AI as it stands right now. Unless every AI generated work also ships with a verified model that can prove none of the work a model was trained on is infringing upon copyright, it can be reasonably assumed that the work is actually using copyrighted material and is thus infringing.<br/><br/>I cannot take Star Wars, remix it, and claim copyright on it, nor could I then use that copyrighted work to lay claim AGAINST Disney, and yet we have examples of this. An artist streamed themselves drawing a work of art. Someone screencapped the work, fed it into an AI machine, generated a work, and then tried to put a copyright claim on the original artist.<br/><br/>AI must not ever be copyrightable.<br/><br/>Copyright exists to protect people, not software. It exists to ensure artists can make a living off their work. AI, by including copyrighted material without permission in its corpus (some of the most commonly used tags are photographs of celebrities, most images of which are copyrighted! some of the other most commonly used tags are the names of artists, meaning their copyrighted work been stolen for training purposes!).<br/><br/>Software that remixes existing copyrighted material should not be able to output material that is itself copyrighted. AI work should NEVER be allowed copyright; if a human being wants copyright protections, they should have to create something themselves, not just write &quot;pretty woman 8k hdr greg rutowski&quot; and get a machine to do the work for them.<br/><br/>When I commission art, the ARTIST retains copyright, not me as the commissioner, unless I buy the copyright from them as well, right?<br/><br/>Well, someone who uses an AI generator is really no different than a client. They tell the machine what they want, and it outputs what they say, just like a client asking an artist. Except this time, they&#39;re asking an artist whose only skill is tracing copyrighted work from other people.<br/><br/>If an artist trains an AI model on THEIR OWN art, then maybe THAT ARTIST could have copyright protections.<br/><br/>But unless someone can prove the entire training corpus of the AI model the art--&quot;here&#39;s the model, here&#39;s the seed, here&#39;s my prompts, here&#39;s everything I used to make this art and I can prove none of it is under copyright&quot;--I don&#39;t think copyright should ever be granted to AI art.
