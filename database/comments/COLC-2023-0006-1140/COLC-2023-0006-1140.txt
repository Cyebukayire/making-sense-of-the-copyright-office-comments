Allowing AI created works to be copyrightable by whatever individual told the AI to make it opens up numerous problems.  Firstly, the work is essentially &quot;commissioned&quot; by the one giving the AI the command, though of course current AI lacks any awareness of what it&#39;s doing whatsoever and doesn&#39;t understand a bit of it, so it&#39;s not like copyright can be granted to the AI.  However, granting the copyright to the &quot;commissioner&quot; in this case is much like granting photo rights to the owner of a camera when an ape takes a photo with it.  It doesn&#39;t serve the public good.  All it does is allow artless corporate owners to cut out artists entirely, leading to (as current AI tech goes) stale works recycled from real efforts.  Increasingly, current AI is also feeding off itself and other&#39;s works as well.<br/><br/>There is an argument to be had over how much human input in an art piece is needed to make it copyrightable, but the right answer is definitely not &quot;inputting a few prompts&quot;.  I&#39;d say as a starting point, over half the work by some subjective judgment.<br/><br/>I work at a school, which is currently going through numerous worries concerning the roll AI should have in student education.  For my part, I feel as though teaching kids how to prompt AI to create things is tantamount to teaching kids how to order someone else to do their work for them.  Don&#39;t allow this thing to happen.  I believe the recent judgement against copyrighting AI works was correct.
