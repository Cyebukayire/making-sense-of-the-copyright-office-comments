I&rsquo;m an artist terrified that everything I create can currently get legally scraped by big corporations or just people who would want to steal my art. I&rsquo;m also a woman terrified by the rise of &ldquo;1 click undressing AI&rdquo; or deepfake porn generators that can easily and legally take my instagram pictures and use them.
