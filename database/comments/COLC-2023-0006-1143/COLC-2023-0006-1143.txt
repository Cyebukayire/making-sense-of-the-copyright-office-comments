As the basis for AI art is using the intellectual property of hundreds of thousands of other artists, it cannot be said that it falls under fair use. While an artist may train by studying from nature, AI cannot be used without first regurgitating the work of others. At the very least, it should be illegal to use the works of others in AI programs that have not consented to their property being used. Preferably, AI should be banned from all art competitions and portfolios for non-AI work. <br/>If I can speak to the heart of the matter, if AI isn&#39;t limited at all, artists will lose their jobs and their reasons for creating. Their art will be wiped from the internet, and in the near future AI will run out of new things to consume. Shows will look the same, music will sound the same, every single book cover will have the same three pictures.<br/>And if we can get more direct, music artists have IMMENSE power in their copyright. If technology can be taught to recognize the specific brush strokes of an artist, it should be used to identify those artists in the work of AI and ban it from being profited off of.
