I feel that AI uses unethical methods of stealing art from all manner of people to train their models. These models are then used to plagiarize work and actively harm individuals who don&#39;t have the time and resources it would take to fight the theft of their work in the first place and feel immediate impact of loss of income due to the plagiarism used to create work that take jobs from people. Creativity is the providence of people not some shitty algorithm that can&#39;t maintain itself without more theft. Protect the people. AI work should not be copywrite-able. Protection cannot extend to a machine that harms the people it steals from. Machines should strive to improve the lives of people not create art while the people work increasingly worthless jobs. What is the point of life without creation?
