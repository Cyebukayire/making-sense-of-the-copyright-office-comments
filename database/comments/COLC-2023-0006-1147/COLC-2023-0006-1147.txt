Hello. I am a small personal artist, disabled and living off of welfare. I do not like AI generation of art for three reasons.<br/><br/>#1 -- It uses up too much energy and water during a time where we are in climate crisis. We need to be paring down unnecessary things like AI generation, advertising, and email spam because it&#39;s horrifically wasteful without providing any real benefit to society at this point in time.<br/><br/>#2 -- As a very poor disabled artist if my work was stolen and used for AI projects, I would have almost no recourse due to lack of funds to hire a lawyer and fight for my rights. The most vulnerable are likely to be hit hardest and have their ideas and labor scraped for AI generation and the least likely to be able to defend themselves and their creations in court; lawsuits are scary, messy, expensive, and hard. If you can only pay maybe $1000 for defense and a corporation can pay $100,000, your rights don&#39;t mean much. So don&#39;t give corporations that avenue at all!<br/><br/>#3 -- AI can be used to generate hate speech and obscene works against original creator&#39;s will and intent, IE a voice actor&#39;s voice being fed into an AI generator and then used to create pornography or recite Nazi speeches. This could very obviously have severe repercussions on not just people&#39;s livelihoods but their sense of self; finding pornography of yourself made against your will being used by strangers online is a violation. Combined with poor moderation practices, poor legal protections could leave even just one dedicated malicious harasser capable of causing great harm.
