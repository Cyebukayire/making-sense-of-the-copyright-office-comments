Knowing what I do as a software developer - the thousands of creations that are ingested and regurgitated by &#39;AI&#39; programs without a single care of those artists is just miserably bleak to think about. Beyond that though, my concerns are two fold - is an artists original intention being respected? (Which, seeing as how thousands of creators are using programs to obscure and make their art unreadable by image recognition software the answer is most likely no.) And secondly, what functional value does AI seek to have? (If you ask any individual making a program like ChatGPT or otherwise, they are seeking to flood the market, without a care for the veracity of the information it produces or the livelihood of the artistic stylings they blatantly rip off.) <br/><br/>Ultimately, if the artist is not being asked and the program is seeking to mimc an individuals style to the point where the original artist&#39;s own &#39;market share&#39; can be overridden, it is a copyright concern and one I am very greatful the agency is taking a look at. I&#39;d strongly recommend limiting the scope of content AI is allowed to scrape, the functional use of AIs (i.e internal company usage only vs public facing), and give creators who have already had their work fed against their will into these programs clear and easy ways to send cease and desists or pursue legal action to reclaim their individuality. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
