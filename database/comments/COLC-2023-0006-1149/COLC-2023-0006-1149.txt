I am an artist.  I do a little of everything: photography, dye work, embroidery, photography...  I make my living by selling my art.  My hobby is writing, I hope to make a living at it someday too. <br/><br/>AI has many bad uses: replacing people&#39;s jobs, replacing art with mass productions, and spreading false information.  Many of the current AI use my art and my writing, to make algorithms without asking me if it was okay or purchasing the rights to my work.  It is theft and makes it harder for me to make my living with my art.  It creates the risk of people impersonating me because it has stolen copies of my works to use in its template.  <br/><br/>AI has many good uses: looking for lost submarines and counting fish, predicting the weather and many other things.  We can not and should not discard AI.  But it needs to be carefully controlled and regulated so that it is used for the things that help the most people rather than enriching a greedy few.
