Hello. Thank you for reading this comment. I am not a lawyer. I think I have an above average understanding of AI and an average to above-average understanding of copyright law.<br/><br/>1) I do not believe that work generated by AI models should be allowed to be copyrighted (work such as written word, images, melodies), unless the copyright-seeker held the copyright of every piece of work the model was trained with. My understanding is that AI models can need tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of inputs during training. This would mean that requiring the model-developer to use only copyrighted materials could be severely limiting to projects with low amounts of funding. I don&#39;t care.<br/><br/>2) I do not believe companies should be allowed to use copyrighted works without permission for the training of AI models if they expect to be able to copyright the work themselves, or if they release the AI model to the public, as both circumvent the rights of the original copyright holder to control the spread of their work and its derivatives.<br/><br/>3) I believe there are ample free-use/open source options for training in &quot;small business&quot;-type scenarios, and I believe large businesses/corporations must not be allowed to use copyrighted work without paying the appropriate price.<br/><br/>4) I do believe, with my limited understanding of the law, the design AI models themselves can and should qualify for copyright.<br/><br/>Thank you again.
