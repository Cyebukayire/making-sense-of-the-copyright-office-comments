Products of AI technology, whether it be art, writing, or other, cannot be copyrighted as it is not a human creation and solely relies on the theft of material produced by hundreds and thousands of real life human artists in order to produce an odd amalgamation of those pieces that feels soulless and unnerving. There have been countless instances of artists discovering their pieces being used to &ldquo;train&rdquo; these AI&rsquo;s without permission and countless jobs are now being lost due to marketing executives trying to skimp out on paying their employees what they are worth and impacting the overall quality of the things they are producing. AI technology has no role in producing art and the full force of the law should be used to protect the humans and their creations whose works are being stolen by the people who use these AI technologies.
