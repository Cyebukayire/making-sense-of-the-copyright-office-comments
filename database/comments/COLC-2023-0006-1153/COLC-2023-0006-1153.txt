Hello, I am a writer and I am concerned with unregulated A/I because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. Unregulated A/I is a threat.  Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever.
