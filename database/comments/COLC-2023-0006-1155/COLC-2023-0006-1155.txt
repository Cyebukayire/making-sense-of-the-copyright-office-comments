I am a software engineer, and have a decent understanding of generative artificial intelligence. I can say with confidence, then, that AI works should not be granted copyright eligibility. These systems are trained on human-made, often copyrighted works. Because the neural network is not human readable, it is practically impossible to tell if an AI model has been trained on stolen material. As such, the assumption must be made that any given AI generated work involves the use of copyrighted material.<br/>AI models do not understand what they are doing. They do not think, nor are they truly intelligent. All popular AIs use probabilistic modeling to fit pieces of their training data together. The product of an AI can be likened to a collage, though it must be stressed that there is no artful intention behind this. In this manner, I do not believe that AI generation constitutes fair use.<br/>Another point of concern is the sheer amount of content that AIs can generate. An AI can generate finished works of considerable size in a mater of minutes. It is unlikely that the U.S. Copyright Office would be able to handle the exponential increase in copyright disputes when one can programmatically generate every possible configuration of words, pixels, or sounds.
