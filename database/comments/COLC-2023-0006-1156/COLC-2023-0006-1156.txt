I believe that AI produced content should not be able to be copyrighted, and that a very heavy eye should be cast upon what it is using to learn on. Too many creators have had their works stolen without express permission by AI training programs. It is wholly unethical and entirely unamerican. American creatives should not have to worry about their jobs being stolen by a program that has already stolen their drawings, books, and music as well. Our country is built upon the belief of freedom - but the ability to copyright things made by AI will greatly incentivize businesses to use it, instead of paying skilled citizens for the jobs they chose.<br/><br/>It is a sad day when creation, humanity&#39;s finest act, becomes automated - and it shall be a wholly tragic one, if it is to replace our finest artists in the sake of saving a dollar.
