So called artificial intelligence is not actual artificial intelligence. Instead it is trained on the work of other artists and creators to produce derivative work that is extrapolated from existing ideas. <br/><br/>In many cases the use of a singular artist with a distinctive style is referred to by name in that style, so any work generated based on their work has their name attached. Any copyright or profit generated from that work is using their name without compensation or often permission and that is extremely damaging to their personal brand and body of work. People may get confused between original works and artificially generated works and believe that they are buying something original and supporting the artist but they could easily end up with a knockoff and the proceeds going to someone typing a few words into a generator. <br/><br/>At the moment we are seeing AI generated books being sold on Amazon under an existing author&#39;s name without permission. In the case of Jane Friedman she was able to get the works removed through copyright, but by granting copyright to AI works this would complicate matters for artists trying to protect themselves.<br/><br/>Granting copyright to works derived from illegally scraped sources goes against the very spirit of copywrighting.
