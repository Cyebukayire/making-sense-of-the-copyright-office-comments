Artificial intelligence takes the work of real people, who have real ideas, and who have done real work to refine their art, and steals it. And it devalues everything that rules that protect intellectual property seek to uphold. Ideas are never original, but what an individual brings to an idea is. The ways we twist and turn and discover, and more than discover- create, is what you protect by protecting artists against AI theft. Right now authors are forcibly having books published under their names and they can do nothing about it. Where will meaningful books go when every writer is too afraid to publish their works for having it drowned in a sea of meaningless word vomit? <br/><br/>The beauty of a painting is not only its ending, but every stroke and thought that went into it. We admire the way an artist thinks about light and shadow, and translates that to us. <br/><br/>When a computer takes that, learns it, and spits out an approximation devoid of thought, depth, or beauty, and more than that, has legal rights to the work of another&#39;s hands, we witness the death of shared creativity. <br/><br/>We witness the death of artists ability to survive making art. And without the ability to sustain those important crafts that make a culture, we resign ourselves to consuming fodder, desperately wishing for something real and tangible and human. Because what makes art significant is not solely the end &quot;product&quot; but every ounce of humanity poured into it. <br/><br/>We must protect artist&#39;s rights. We must protect it like our future depends on it. We must value it because art; music; acting; writing; the act of creation are part of what makes life worth living. Worth sharing. More people need to be encouraged to find the beauty in the world and to transcribe it through their hands, no matter how poorly. Because art is not about the end product. It is about the translation of the world. And those translations get more accurate with practice as all things do. For the majority of people, art is a skill that requires work and hours of practice to grow in. <br/><br/>And that requires encouragement- not the discouragement of an environment where, if you share the work of your hands, it will get shoved into a machine, chewed up, and spit out in a Frankenstein of other&#39;s mangled projects. <br/><br/>We must protect artist&#39;s rights. We must protect creativity. We must protect it or we will lose it.<br/><br/>We must respect the work of each other&#39;s hands. Consider it before thinking of all the ways that statement shouldn&#39;t be true. <br/><br/>We must respect the work of other&#39;s hands, as you would have your own work respected. <br/><br/>That is all. Thank you.
