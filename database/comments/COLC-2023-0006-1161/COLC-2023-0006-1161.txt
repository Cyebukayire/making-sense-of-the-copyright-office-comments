I am an artist, and have been working and struggling to turn my passion into my career. It is a hard and gruelling task, which is only made more stressful and seemingly impossible due to the climate in todays art community. I am of course talking about AI. <br/>AI takes advantage of and steals all sorts of content - copywrited or not, in order to cheaply mass produce a look alike (or sound alike in the case of music, voice acting, or enviromental sound effects) which directly destroys the livelihoods of the very creators it [the AI owner and algorithm] has stolen from.<br/>I believe,  among many others, that AI is unethical. It can have some uses, such as an artist creating their own dataset using their own work (therefore not stealing from others) or purchasing such a dataset from another consenting party, or having the images or content given with intent to be used. If the data is obtained in this way and the results are clearly labeled as AI generated with the source material clear (and actually sourced and mentioned in a way that shows consent), then it could be considered ethical.<br/><br/>However, you are not interested in the ethics of AI. Rather, you need to know whether this sort of content can be copywrited. My answer? No. I do not think that an amalgamation, or a jigsaw of real human creations can ever be considered copywrite protected. Even at its most ethical, in the ways I explained earlier in my comment, the result is simply not a human creation.<br/><br/>I hope that my words and the words of thousands, - even millions, of people just like me, are able to concince you of our right. Our human right, to create. Thank you for your time.
