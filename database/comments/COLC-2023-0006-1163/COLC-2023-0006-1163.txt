AI Generated content, both images and text, show not be able to be copyrighted. The very nature of these technologies requires the in depth copying of hundreds of thousands upon millions to be able to build a model. Even when given prompts as &quot;original&quot; as possible, even when certain works that were commissioned and/or were permitted for use in such generators, the technology ultimately can only preform copy and pasting of text in whatever form it is taught is correct for the task it is directed to perform. One commentator has described it as &quot;the Mandarin turning test&quot;; If a someone who did not speak Mandarin Chinese was locked in a room and given sample texts of  Mandarin conversations and basic guides, after a long time, they could be given a prompt question in Mandarin and be able to feasibly write a acceptable response, but they could not be said to actually know mandarin, as they don&#39;t speak or truly read mandarin, and all their responses are merely puzzle pieces cut together from context clues gathered from looking over their existing data. It is actually impossible for the tech to be trained solely on data it has explicit permission to use, since the sheer amount of data required to get any meaningful responses is so high it surpasses the number of unique individuals who would willing do so. Experiments have been run and the technology, even in its most recent incarnations, has been found to plagiarize constantly, is easily goaded into revealing so, and gives blatantly incorrect information.
