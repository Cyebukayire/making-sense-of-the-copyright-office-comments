AI is theft plain and simple. It scrapes &ldquo;data&rdquo; which in most if not all cases is other people&rsquo;s writing, artwork, photography, music, voices, etc. The companies that do this do not pay the people they are taking this &ldquo;data&rdquo; from. Most of the time, they don&rsquo;t even credit the people they take this &ldquo;data&rdquo; from. In music, there&rsquo;s something similar called sampling. However, any musician that uses sampling has to not only credit the artist they are sampling from, they must also obtain permission and pay the copyright owners. Anything short of this type of arrangement for AI would be a travesty. AI has already stolen from untold people and I highly doubt any of them will see a dime. It would be great to see something done about this.
