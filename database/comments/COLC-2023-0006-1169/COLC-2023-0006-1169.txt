I&rsquo;m ok with AI using copyrighted material for research or informative purposes (to answer questions, make comparisons). However, AI should never be able to create new content using someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property, face/image, voice, style, etc. That is violating the rights of creators. I also do not think AI should be used to write creative content like novels, scripts, songs, etc.
