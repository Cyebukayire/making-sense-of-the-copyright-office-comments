As an artist, I think AI can be a useful tool in some situations. But it is just that: a tool. In the same way that a monkey taking a photo cannot be copyrighted by the monkey, so too should works generated with AI that don&#39;t involve other work by the human not be eligible for copyright. There are larger concerns, of course, such as the legality of training AI models on data scraped unethically, but for the purposes of this question... No. Solely AI-generated works should not be eligible for copyright. If an artist takes an AI generated work and iterates upon it, then I think that can be an area for future discussion but raw images generated by an AI should fall into the public domain.
