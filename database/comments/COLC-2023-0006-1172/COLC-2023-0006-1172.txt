I am a computer scientist by education and profession, these so called AI works are nothing but thinly veiled plagiarism, computers as they are now, and will be for decades, are incapable of producing original works and instead just pick and choose pieces of images or text they were trained on and mash them together and smooth out the result so it appears cohesive, they work on such large sets of data that more often than not it is impossible to track down exactly what it is plagiarizing, but they always are. This software can not think any more than a spreadsheet can think and any improvements to them are just improvements at hiding the theft they are committing.
