I would say I highly oppose AI to be given the same status and leniency with copyright as a human individual mainly because, it can be used to steal work. As an indie artist the fine line between an artists copyright and what an AI can access is very blurred. In my experience I am often getting messages from  fans of my work letting me know that my online art has been stolen and used for financial and commercial gain without my knowledge. This is very damaging to my business and brand financially. An AI art model can literally look up any image on the internet and &quot;recreate&quot; it within seconds. Whereas I a human artist, will have to spend hours talking to my clients and manually drawing the commissioned art. This not only forces me to charge more for art commissions but it also relies on having to be good at marketing. An AI can do all of this for free. I have no way to prevent the AI from stealing my work or identifying who is behind the reselling. I am quite literally being stolen from everyday. This AI is forcing me to lower my prices in order to compete with my own stolen work. That&#39;s not fair nor is it right. Theft is theft no matter who does it even when it is an AI. Artists in the past have used licensing and copyright to help protect them from this theft but I could very well see a future where the art business and many other business&#39;s will no longer be able to sustain their families and livelihoods. I do not support AI being given free range of copyright. It must be regulated and AI has no free range to do whatever it or it&#39;s creator wants. Thank you for your time.
