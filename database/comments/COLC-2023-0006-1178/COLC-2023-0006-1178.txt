AI is not a person, it&#39;s also not a tool. A person using AI to &quot;create&quot; hasn&#39;t made anything, they&#39;ve used the works of actual creators and made a poor amalgamation. <br/><br/>If someone were to use an AI to fully animate, score, and voice a clip. I would say that should not be something that can be copywiten, because the person who trained the AI didn&#39;t make the art or the music or voices that went into the piece. <br/><br/>AI steals from real artists, and now production companies are trying to steal people&#39;s likenesses, their voices, their work, all so they can use them for free forever.<br/><br/>Imagine a studio scanning an actor without a proper contract, and then using that actors face again and again while the actor sees no credit for their likeness. <br/><br/>The things AI &quot;creates&quot; are stolen, we can not allow it to be used unchecked.
