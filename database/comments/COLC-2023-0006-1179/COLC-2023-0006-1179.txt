I am a professional writer, and I feel strongly that the work of any writer, professional or amateur, should never be used by a corporation to train their Artificial Intelligence without the writer&#39;s express permission and compensation. This applies especially to copyrighted work. Yes, the AIs may find patterns in writing and replicate them as opposed to directly plagiarizing. But every AI belongs to a corporation. It is consuming someone else&#39;s work for the express and sole purpose of making money for that corporation. An AI is not a human being, it is, in essence, the tool of a company, existing only to make money for that company. It should not have the same rights as humans to consume and learn from others&#39; material. Its owners should have to pay for what it uses to learn.
