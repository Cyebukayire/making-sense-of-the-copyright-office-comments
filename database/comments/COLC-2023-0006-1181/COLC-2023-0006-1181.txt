I would encourage the following steps to be taken with regard to AI creations: first, that the use of copyrighted works in AI databases be prohibited, and second, that AI output not be viable for copyright protection. In the case of the latter point, there really is no individual who could justifiably hold the copyright to the image. The programmer provided the tools, but a paint-maker has no claim to a painting. The prompt-giver&#39;s only role in the creative process was to request a product. The only people who can claim to have &#39;made&#39; the final product are the people whose work provided the basis for the AI&#39;s neural networking, and their contributions are so utterly ripped apart and confused that they cannot be distinguished. This is the reasoning for my first point -- these AI-generated paintings expressly use others&#39; intellectual property to create their products, and there is no way, to my knowledge, that individuals can even be credited, let alone compensated for having their works used in such a manner. AI art programs should be required to obtain permission from the copyright holders of any piece they wish to include in their database, and preferably provide some form of credit or remuneration in exchange.
