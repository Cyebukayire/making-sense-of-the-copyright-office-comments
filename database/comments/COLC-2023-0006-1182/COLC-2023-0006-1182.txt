AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; is just a collection of others peoples art that has been scrapped off the internet and shoved together without permission from any of the original artists, the same goes for AI writing and chat bots, they&rsquo;re scraping the internet for text. Especially Ao3, how else would it know what an Omega heat is? Why should you be able to copyright something that&rsquo;s essentially just a Frankenstein of other peoples work that you try to pass off as your own?
