If photocopying a book is theft, A.I scraping is theft too. If plagiarizing an existing work is theft, A.I scraping is theft too (and plagiarizing is EXACTLY how A.I works, it shoplifts WHOLESALE pieces).  If projecting a show you&#39;re watching on Netflix on the side of a building for all neighbors to watch is theft (unauthorized use of media), then so is scraping our works to train A.I -without our consent-. Stolen works CANNOT be copyrighted, let alone plagiarized works that are not even made by a human being.<br/><br/>I won&#39;t fool myself appealing to your &quot;human decency,&quot; but to your self preservation instinct: FACT: 59.8% of your country&#39;s population works white collar jobs (yourselves included). FACT: It&#39;s way easier and cheaper to replace a white-collar worker than to replace a blue collar one (replacing handywork takes actual robots, which are stupidly expensive, whereas human life has never been cheaper in history than now). FACT: Billionaires are as stupid as they&#39;re evil, and won&#39;t hesitate in making 60% of your population unemployed overnight, destroying your country&#39;s economy. FACT: The USA is allergic to socialism, and will NEVER institute BUI, the moment said sixty percent of your population becomes unemployed, you&#39;re all gonna starve to death, because blue collar workers will defend their jobs with tooth and nail and they&#39;re considerably fitter than you guys so good luck beating them in a riot.<br/><br/>Self destruction or rule of law. The choice is yours.
