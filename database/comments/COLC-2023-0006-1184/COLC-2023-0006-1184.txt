AI generators of any kind scrape content from people that do not consent, and allow people to tear pieces of other artists&#39; work to shreds to make hollow facsimiles of &quot;art&quot; that don&#39;t have the same passion as a traditional or digital artist. The point of art is meant to be, first and foremost, passion, and AI spits in the fact of that by allowing people to type in whatever words suit their fancy and have a program spit something out that it says is art, or a story, or anything of the sort. AI could also potentially invade other facets of life in potentially harmful ways, such as profiting off of information or articles with patently false information that had been spit out from a generator and cobbled together with other, more meaningful and truthful content. It could also potentially cause even worse harm to the economy later down the line, as many companies are already looking to replace entire teams of people with AI generators for scripts, movie effects, actors, etc., and if allowed to continue will put potentially millions of people out of jobs, which will destroy the entertainment industry, perhaps one of the most lucrative industries in the United States, and render an entire facet of being a human being completely and utterly pointless. You absolutely cannot allow people to copyright AI generated content, or you risk damaging entire fields of work and crippling the economy potentially beyond repair this time. Please, for the sake of creatives everywhere, *do not allow AI generated content to become protected material.*
