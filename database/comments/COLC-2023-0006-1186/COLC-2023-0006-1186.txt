AI should not qualify for copyright. This would go against the basis of copyright, which, &ldquo;protects original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works&ldquo; AI should not be considered an original work because it is created using other copyrighted works. This is especially important because of image-image generation in AI (when someone inputs a single image to generate a very similar  image using AI). This is simply stealing another persons work and should NOT be considered for copyright. Most importantly, from a moral perspective, copyrighting AI will leave many people without jobs, companies wont need artists, writers, graphic designers, etc.
