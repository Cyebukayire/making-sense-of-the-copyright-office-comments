I do not believe that any AI-generated content should be patentable or possibly copywrited.  It was not the product of human ingenuity; the source for AI-gen content is almost always stolen material from actual humans.  When it isn&#39;t stolen, it still isn&#39;t original work.  Computers are not capable of original thought, and allowing people to make money off the works of others is parasitic and destructive to all forms of art and ideas.
