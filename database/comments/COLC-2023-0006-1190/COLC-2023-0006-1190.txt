Obvious thievery, and shouldn&rsquo;t be employed without any and all heavy regulations, restrictions, and explicit written consent. No one consents to having their work stolen, so why should AI programs run without punishment to their creators? The fact there has been some intelligent enough to lie to people about being &ldquo;visually impaired,&rdquo; is horrendous and utterly terrifying. Think about the implications this unleashed. The fact now we can have such intelligent thieving programs lie convincingly just to steal whatever the programer/s want? No thank you. I wish it would be banned altogether, but if we can prevent works being stolen I&rsquo;d be happy with that. AI is nothing but a con-mans play thing.
