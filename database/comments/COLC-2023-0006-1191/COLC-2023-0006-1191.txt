Hello, I&rsquo;m a writer and illustrator and I believe regulation of algorithmically created material is important for protecting intellectual property and ensuring the security of creators like myself and many of my peers. The databases the AI pull from frequently contain works taken from creators without permission and have components lifted directly through algorithmic generation. Creator&rsquo;s works are stripped for parts and conglomerated together without attribution, and sold as a simulacra at a bargain to companies in place of the works being profited from. An ai market prevents the spread of new ideas, instead capitalizing on the talents of artists without compensation. It promotes flagrant plagiarism and will likely be detrimental for culture at large.
