Machine Learning, commonly known as Artificial Intelligence, is not a creative machine like the human brain. All it can do is &quot;look at&quot; data and art created by humans and then copy it to the best of its ability. This is distinct from human creativity, where a person&#39;s unique thoughts, experiences, philosophies, and ways of understanding the world will affect a human&#39;s creative output in unique ways. AI cannot have any thoughts, experiences, or philosophies, it can only imitate the creative output of a human or group of humans, from a dataset created by a different human. This would be perfectly fine and not objectionable at all, of that dataset was entirely comprised of texts and images and other such materials that fall under the public domain. This, however is not the case. Many current examples of Artificial Intelligence, such as ChatGPT, have been given data that is still protected by copyright without the explicit consent of the copyright holders. This is concerning to me, as it could cause a creative landscape where people using AI can essentially profit off of other peoples&#39; work. I believe that, in order for AI art to be copyrightable, there needs to be some sort of safeguard to ensure that all of its training data comes from works that are in the Public Domain, and from people who have explicitly consented to having their creative output be copied by AI.
