Anything produced by AI, regardless of medium, should not be allowed to be copyrighted. Copyright implies an original idea, something that a person or creature with rational thought came up with and created. AI takes data from multiple sources - often without the original creator&#39;s consent! - and produces an amalgamation or approximation of the original(s). It undermines all the hard work that people put into creating, and in addition to needing more oversight and regulation, AI-produced work should never be considered for copyright.
