I believe that the products of artificial intelligence should not be able to be copyrighted on their own. It is akin to comissioning an artist or writer, both of whom, traditionally, would have to give copyright over to the comissioner. AI cannot create wholly original works. It has no ideas of it&#39;s own. Everything it creates comes from what humans have created. Everything it creates should be public domain. If ao collaborative work is done with effort from a human party, it should be treated the same as if they altered a public domain work in the same way. AI should not be trained on human works unless they are in public domain or every creator has agreed to let their works be part of the training by opting in rather than opting out. If an AI has a work in its training and the creator did not consent to it being used, the creator should be compensated monetarily for each day the AI kept their work in the dataset and the company should take the work out of the data set immediately or else risk a fine. I do not think &#39;art styles&#39; should be copyrighted, as this would lead to many human artists who learn to draw from looking at the works of artists before them having unreasonable lawsuits filed against them (the newer artists), discouraging many from entering a career in art (which already suffers much discouragement).
