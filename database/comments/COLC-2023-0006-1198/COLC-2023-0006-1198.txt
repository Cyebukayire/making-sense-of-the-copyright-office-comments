To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in response to the Copyright Office&#39;s notice of inquiry on copyright and artificial intelligence to argue that generative AI systems like Stable Diffusion should remain open source and freely usable by the public.<br/><br/>There are several compelling legal and ethical reasons why closing off access to models like Stable Diffusion would be problematic:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>⁠AI models are not creative works in themselves - they are tools. Just as restricting access to pens and paintbrushes would impede free expression, limiting generative models impedes the public&#39;s ability to utilize new technology for creative pursuits. The outputs created by users should be evaluated for originality, not the tools.<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>⁠AI models rely heavily on public domain and openly licensed data for training. Stable Diffusion was trained largely on LAION&#39;s open dataset of 5 billion Creative Commons images scraped from the internet. Cutting off public access to models built on public data raises serious legal and ethical concerns.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>⁠Research and development thrives in open environments. Legal uncertainty around generative models may drive AI development underground, limiting the public&#39;s ability to monitor biases and harms. Keeping models open enables broader oversight.<br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>⁠Current copyright law already provides enforcement mechanisms against unlawful use of AI-generated content, reducing the need for further restrictions on the technology itself. Existing legal protections are sufficient.<br/>5.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>⁠Limiting public access to AI models could disproportionately impact researchers, students, artists and creators who do not have the resources of large tech companies. Keeping models open levels the playing field.<br/><br/>In short, maintaining open access to generative AI models supports this transformative technology&#39;s creativity, innovation, and ethical development. I urge the Copyright Office to continue enabling public progress in AI by rejecting proposals to close off access to systems like Stable Diffusion. Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to talk about this more.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
