At its most basic level, copyright exists as an agreement between society and the artist. Having art is good for society. Make us art, says society, and we will let you profit solely off this art for some span of time. This is the only possible way art can survive in a capitalist society.<br/><br/>Presumably, you want to preserve a capitalist society. Therefore, you must enforce copyright. Companies must prove that they have contracts with every artist, writer, or other creative they scraped to train their bots, from the most prominent named artists to comparative unknowns who posted a single tweet. If they cannot do so in any instance, their entire imitation bot must be erased and made illegal. Only imitation bots trained on properly sourced and contracted material can operate. Furthermore, no product of imitation bots must ever be allowed to be copyrighted.<br/><br/>This may seem harsh compared to what you are currently pursuing, but the only alternatives would be to destroy all incentives to make art or dismantle capitalism. Those are the only three possible options in our society. One of those options will happen, whether consciously chosen or not. I urge you to choose consciously and wisely. The Copyright Office is our best defense against the total collapse of the artistic sector of our society.
