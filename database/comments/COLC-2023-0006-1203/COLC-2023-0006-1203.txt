Hello. <br/><br/>I am only a hobby artist, but I often see fellow artists often get targeted for art theft from many of the AI databases and it worries me. <br/><br/>Many artists who have spent decades honing in on their skills, with up to days/months/years dedicated to singular pieces, have their work uploaded without consent to these new AI databases, which spits out a soulless forgery with little to no repercussion. While this theft is disgusting, then comes the added insult of the people who monetize these amalgamation of another artist&#39;s work. <br/><br/>I can certainly respect the coding that went into designing these AI computations, but this is only a portion of what goes into &#39;AI&#39; art work. The coder still cannot create work without the input of the art that goes into these computations. If the AI art is created out of a partnership between the coder and the artist, then I could understand copy-writing and monetizing this material. However as the systems in place currently stand, this is never a true partnership and the people who put in most of the work are derived of the rightful compensation and credit they deserve.<br/><br/>I think the best system involving copy-writing and monetization should come from the explicit consent of the artist, who is able to pick and chose and have creative input in the creation of work based upon the database of their previous work. I think it should be considered theft and copy-write infringement if stolen art is uploaded and used in anyway in the creation of AI artwork. I also would like to say any form of &#39;passive consent&#39;, i.e. in regards to social media sites haphazardly updating rules to say anything uploaded to their site is free use, should be considered null and void and not allowed to be copyright or monetized.<br/><br/>I believe it would set a dangerous precedent to allow the current informal AI art creation to become standard. I could only see the field of copyright devolving into a fight between who has the most money and resources dedicated to fighting lengthy legal battles to claim ownership, leaving any non-corporate creator without protections from exploitation.<br/><br/>Thank you.
