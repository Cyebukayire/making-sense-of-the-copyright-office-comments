The use of generative artificial intelligence is much more of a detriment than anything else. The technology itself is inherently unethical, seeing as how it&#39;s entirely built around stealing and scraping from the works of real artists, writers, and other creators, largely without any permission or consent from said creators. Generative AI can also be used to create images and texts that are dangerously misleading, and combating misinformation is more important now than ever before. There need to regulations surrounding these AI tools, and the sooner the better. Ideally, there would be restrictions around who can even use the technology, but disallowing AI-created works to be copyrighted is a good start.
