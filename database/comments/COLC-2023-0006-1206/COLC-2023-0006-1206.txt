You can train AI to reproduce 1 specific image, each new image is technically distinct because the AI was trained to make it on its own<br/>But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s actually new<br/>Using an algorithm to produce something &quot;different&quot; based on huge swaths of data is really just that. It&#39;s not technically new, even if the method to develop it is<br/><br/>Using AI to generate something new is like putting an instagram filter over copyrighted material. It doesn&#39;t matter if the new stuff isn&#39;t copyrighted, you still used someone&#39;s material to make it.<br/><br/>I know you, person who disagrees, wants to make an argument that proves AI stuff is novel--but the AI you are referring to is literally just a slightly more complicated version of the replication AI machine/filter I mentioned.<br/><br/>I am anti-AI when people use this as an excuse to undercut the people whose works are being used to create these images. <br/><br/>If you want to sell something AI based, it makes sense to also include the people whose works you&#39;re using... At the price point THEY set.
