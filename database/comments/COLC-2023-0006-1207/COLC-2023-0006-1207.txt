Because the goals of the creators of generative AI (such as large language models) are ultimately commercial in nature, I do not believe that the purpose of training a large language model qualifies as fair use of others&#39; intellectual property. Hence, when the intellectual property of others is used for this purpose, the rights of the owners of that intellectual property have been violated. For these developers to profit financially, when they have not given fair financial compensation to those whose intellectual property rights they have violated, is offensive to ethics. And even this presumes the consent of those whose intellectual property has been exploited, which should not be taken for granted. (That the use of this AI will surely put human beings out of their jobs, including, conceivably, some of the very humans whose intellectual property has been exploited, adds insult to injury. Or perhaps we should say, injury to injury.)
