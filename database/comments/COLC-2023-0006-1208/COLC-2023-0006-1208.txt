The use of original work from creators that have not given consent is incredibly alarming and should be considered a drawback to the use of AI. Even with consent, the fact that AI creations can be passed off as original work and used in media is also an issue. It undermines the work of real creators as it literally relies on their work to even exist. This is wholly different from the concept of inspiration as it does not require the person using AI to provide any effort. If AI relies entirely on the work of other creators, than any product could not be truly unique and deserving of copyright protections. AI also poses a great risk in the spreading of false information. As quickly as AI products had been released, many fake images started to circulate at alarming speeds. AI that can create video, photos, and audio pose as a threat and liability to anyone, particularly public figures such as politicians. This goes beyond simply ruining someone&rsquo;s reputation, but can cause doubt or fear for the public. Perhaps all these forms of media could be created by a person using different applications, but it takes time, training/knowledge, and effort to create. AI makes it quick and efficient to create fake images and work. The danger is who uses it and for what means.
