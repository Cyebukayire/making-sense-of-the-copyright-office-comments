I don&rsquo;t feel like &ldquo;art&rdquo; created by AI should be eligible for copyright. There are no protections for the artist(s) who actually did the work most AI models are trained on and few of any AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; generators credit or even acknowledge the artists their models are trained on. Furthermore few, if any give practical options for removing someone&rsquo;s labor from the platforms. Until AI platforms can 110% prove their models are trained on art and literary works (including blogs, public comments, or articles published on third-party sites) that are voluntarily donated to AI generation, any &ldquo;art&rdquo; created by these sites is little more than a derivative work at best and a collage of plagiarized works at least. There is nothing &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; about AI. It is grenerative algorithms based on worked the querents have no right to use. Manipulating search queries is not an act of creation, it&rsquo;s glorified google searching.
