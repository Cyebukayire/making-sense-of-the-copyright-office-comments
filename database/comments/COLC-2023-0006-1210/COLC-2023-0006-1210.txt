Hello, I am concerned about unregulated AI because of it&#39;s threat to the livelihoods of artists. This technology has already done much damage due to the lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little to no recourse. I want regulations so that we can start to work towards this new technology being used responsibly, rather than erratically.
