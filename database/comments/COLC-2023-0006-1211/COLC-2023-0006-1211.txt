As a member of the Writers Guild of America, I think it&#39;s imperative to mandate that AI generated works document what copyrighted material they used in generating new work. In addition, AI companies must provide compensation to the original copyright holders whose work was used. I also think that we need to put reasonable limits on the use of AI so that artists are not completely displaced.
