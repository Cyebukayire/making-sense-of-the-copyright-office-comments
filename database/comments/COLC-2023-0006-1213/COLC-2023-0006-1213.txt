As currently implemented, the &quot;AI&quot; systems put in place are fully automated theft on a scale never before seen. Each company involved has shown over and over that they will lie and mislead to try and squeeze further profit. The entire world is burning, the poor are getting poorer, but hey they made a machine that steals every image and expression humanity has ever had, so it can make you look like an astronaut!<br/><br/>I only pray that those wiser than I can find some way to slow down the endless consumption that eats us. Or we get hit by a big space rock. 50/50.
