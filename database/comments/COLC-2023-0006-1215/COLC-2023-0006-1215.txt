I believe use of AI must be regulated as there is a significant tangible and monetary impact across all areas of art. Already, writers, illustrators, and other artists are being replaced with AI-generated works. For example: The current Writers Guild of America and Studio Actors Guild strikes are occurring in part because the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers do not want to regulate the use of AI in the industry. As of the date of this comment, the AMPTP&#39;s refusal to negotiate in good faith is a signal to the industry that the AMPTP wants to replace writers and actors with AI. This will place MILLIONS out of work. <br/><br/>Use of AI should be encouraged as tools to assist people (human beings) in simplifying their workload and workflow. For example, animators use AI to generate hundreds of trees for a background. This is completely reasonable and has a net benefit for workers and producers. However, use of AI wholesale without use of ethically obtained datasets, without protection of workers, without common sense regulation does not benefit society. It will only benefit a select few who stand to profit greatly off of it. <br/><br/>Therefore, common sense regulation is necessary for use of AI.<br/>1.) AI-generated content should not have copyright and be protected by law. It is not a transformative work. It was not created by a human. It is simply regurgitation by a computer.<br/>2.) Any profit generated by these organizations such as ChatGPT and Midjourney should be redistributed to the writers and illustrators. Because AI generators such as ChatGPT and Midjourney have been trained on datasets including artists and writers who did not consent for their intellectual property to be included and were not paid. This violates their copyright and writers and illustrators ought to be compensated for misuse of their intellectual property. <br/>3.) AI are to be used as tools not to replace workers. Industries who use these tools with the express purpose to replace workers should be fined or taxed appropriately and these fines should be redistributed to support workers in these industries. <br/><br/>This is an extremely important issue to me as I myself am a writer. The thought of my work being comparable to what is generated instantly by ChatGPT, potentially because it was trained on works like mine, makes me sick. It makes me question the purpose of art. It makes me question the purpose of copyright. These organizations have made no effort to hide that copyrighted work was used in the datasets. If the copyright of millions of artists, writers, and illustrators are not upheld at this critical juncture of time, then what is the point of copyright and the copyright office? <br/><br/>Thank you for allowing me to provide input. <br/><br/>
