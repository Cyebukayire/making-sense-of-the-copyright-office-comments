As both a fiction writer and an amateur voice over actor, I am concerned by the growing instances of AI being used to fabricate, and in some cases steal, writing and audio that can and should be created by a human being. These points have also been brought up in the recent WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, as having our ideas, labor, voices, and images being used without compensation is a real danger and is already taking place.<br/><br/>When I was a child, I loved the idea of AI. I imagined true sentience would mean that human beings aren&#39;t alone, and we can learn from others different from ourselves. AI is not true sentience, or sentience of any kind. It is an algorithm created by human beings in order to steal ideas and labor from other human beings. It&#39;s a product of rampant capitalism, and it does nothing to advance human beings as a society or on an individual level. People trying to make a quick profit at the expense of others should not be allowed to happen on such a rampant scale, especially when there are very real instances of it resulting in copyright theft and identity fraud.<br/><br/>Thank you for listening, and I hope you take this issue as seriously as I do.
