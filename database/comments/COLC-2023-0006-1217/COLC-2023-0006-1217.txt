I do not think generative AI is copyrightable, nor do I think it should be able to copyright itself when it scrapes content off the internet, usually content that is either already protected or content created by third party individuals who are fans of an already copyrighted intellectual property. A fan made piece of content cannot be copyrighted, thus a generated piece trained on that copyrighted material should also not be allowed to being copyrighted. It is not making original work, it is taking content from the internet to generate what it &quot;thinks&quot; should be in that particular section. There is no way to garuntee the pieces are unique, nor is there a way to garuntee the generative AI is not trained on content that is watermarked or otherwise already copyrighted. Those who are used in these generative AI pieces have no way to give consent and no way to have any say over what can and cannot be done with their medium. Generative AI voices can make anyone say anything, which can be incrddibly harmful to voice actors and those in the vocal profession. Artists cannot have credit for their art pieces and can have copies sold illegally of their work but generated by an AI, articles for scientific articles and education papers have already had problems with generating false information because the AI was trained on flawed information. If these generative AIs can protect their plagurisms under copyright, there is no garuntee they wont strike out against those original works they studied from and cause them to be removed, which will destroy the system as more AI generation is added to the model, the more the generations fall apart as flawed generated images and writing create even more flawed and false generations. These generatove works should not be protected because are fundementally built in a way where the content they create cannot in any way generate new original media, and require existing media that is already protected to be fed into the system to make the generative AI work at all.
