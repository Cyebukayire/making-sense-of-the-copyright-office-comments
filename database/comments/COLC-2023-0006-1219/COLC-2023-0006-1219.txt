Ai is an existential threat to many industries and countless jobs. The US government needs to implement strong and ethical regulations to ensure that no hardworking Americans are replaced by Ai. The striking members of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA are quite literally on the frontlines of this battle right now. It is the government&rsquo;s job to stand with ALL workers in this fight. On top of all of that, Ai is categorically unethical and potentially illegal. Currently, &ldquo;Ai generators are using artworks and texts and all kinds of intellectual property to generate new versions of it &ndash; without the consent of the human creators.&rdquo; We are at a real precipice here and the US government needs to stand with workers and creators.  Otherwise, the economic ramifications will be catastrophic.
