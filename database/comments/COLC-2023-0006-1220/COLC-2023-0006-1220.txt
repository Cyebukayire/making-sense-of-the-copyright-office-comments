Regarding AI and it&#39;s connection to copywrite.<br/><br/>AI is a tool that can be very dangerous depending on the user coding or commanding the robot, simple examples of this is the mimicking of voices AI can make, the mimicking of art, coding, video, and most media. These mimics have thus been popularized on the internet-- see videos of President Biden&#39;s voice singing or making outrageous claims-- and while they are incredible tools of automation, these machines can make such indistinguishable mimics that it poses a serious question of where a line must be drawn. Is now the time to start copyrighting voices? All in hope that we won&#39;t find such videos of false claims that presume to be very real? And not often are these medias labeled with clear distinguishment between real v. AI, which leads to a perpetuation of false claims in media. AI will be just another step that makes it harder and harder to find the truth amongst the false media.
