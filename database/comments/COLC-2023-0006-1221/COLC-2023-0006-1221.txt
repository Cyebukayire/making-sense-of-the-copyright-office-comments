It is absolutely critical to bear in mind that the purpose of copyright is to protect artists--particularly, to protect individual artists from being undercut by businesspeople, who may use their outsized supply of money to beat a creator to market with their own creation. While a large and profitable industry has sprung up around the creation and trade of intellectual property, the point of intellectual property has always been to ensure that a person who creates for a living cannot have their living stolen from them.<br/><br/>The question of whether AI can &quot;learn&quot; from an artist, the same way another artist can, has been raised repeatedly. Likewise, the question of whether restricting use of other works in training datasets would be like restricting artists from studying other artists. The answer to this is simple: The point of the law is not to treat an AI exactly like a regular artist. The point of the law is to prevent harm, more specifically, to prevent the harm of plagarism. If AI must be treated like a special case, then so be it--the law is full of special cases. It has to be; the real world is not as simple as we wish it could be. Besides--if we were to treat AI as an artist, how would we even settle an infringement case? Can one bring the software to court? Can it pay damages? Of course not. We cannot even tell the AI not to infringe again, because current-generation AI does not &#39;think&#39; the way a human does.<br/><br/>There is also the perennial questions of obscenity and misinformation. Content generation software can be used to create some frankly disturbing things, and some have argued that the kinds of content that can be created with AI should be regulated. To this, I say: We&#39;ve done this song and dance before. Obscenity laws have never succeeded in their supposed purpose of protecting Americans from the horrors of the world; they have only done additional harm. For every one alarming work of smut and depravity that gets silenced, another creation is silenced--a creation which sought to speak frankly about a horrible topic. And--whether or not strange and surreal forms of erotica should exist--an incredible amount of harm has been done by silencing those who try to address the horrific truths of the world. How many people, subjected to those horrors in the real world, will never realize that their experience is not the norm--because anybody who tries to speak out is told that polite society has no room for such works of fiction?<br/><br/>In summary: The primary threat that the current state of AI brings is a threat to artists and their ability to make a living off of art. Restricting content is a fool&#39;s errand, and treating the machine as if it is an artist does not work.
