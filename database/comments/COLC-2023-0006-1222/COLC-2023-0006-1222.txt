There is nothing redeemable about Artificial Intelligence, and nothing good ever comes from such a thing.<br/>Nothing at all.<br/>I used to view Artificial Intelligence as being only good for novelty purposes, but after learning how much it destroys our art, music, and animation industries, I no longer wish for it to exist.<br/>I yearn for a world where there is a complete ban on Artificial Intelligence, where human beings are valued more than the machines attempting to replace them, and where we as a species can finally give a hearty &ldquo;hasta la vista, baby&rdquo; to this accursed plague we call Artificial Intelligence.<br/>
