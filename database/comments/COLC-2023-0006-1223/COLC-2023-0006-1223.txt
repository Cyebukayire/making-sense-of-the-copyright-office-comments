AI generates content using stolen material mined from private web users without permission. It is without nuance or soul and often rife with errors and harmful information. No AI generated art or material should be copywrite-able, as it was not created by a person and cannot be &quot;owned&quot; by the program which generated it. However, as we&#39;ve already seen these AI-generated materials can and have been sold or used to create copyrighted material (as cover art for a novel, for example). These images were created using the private property of individuals, as these works are not properly protected online from parasitic datamining. Users understand that by uploading an original art piece or text, there is the possibility it will be downloaded and spread without their consent. However they must be protected from their work being absorbed into an AI such as ChatGPT and used to generate harmful and unoriginal content. The world has changed a lot since the standardization of copyright, but there must be some way to protect man from the machine and from those who would use these programs to profit from the work and ideas of others.
