Creative works generated by an AI cannot be copyrightable at all.  There&#39;s no way for an AI to reliably generate creative works without first being trained on countless works by many, many others.  Unlike a person learning to write or paint, an AI is simply directly absorbing information and then regurgitating it, either as a direct copy of an individual, or as an amalgamation of something made by others.  It&#39;s a crime worse than piracy; at least, with piracy, the merit of the creator&#39;s work is being acknowledged and enjoyed directly, even if they&#39;re being denied financial compensation.  With AI, it&#39;s being perverted and twisted into something else.  That can be handy as a plaything or a brainstorming tool, but those works produced should not be copyrightable.  This should even extend into creative nonfiction such as articles for websites.<br/><br/>There is probably a case to be made for personal use of generative AI, but when it comes to profit, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way for it to count without it essentially being theft.  Honestly, I&#39;m not even comfortable with works being taken by an AI to be used to vomit works for millions without input of the original creator.<br/><br/>In short, I think that:<br/><br/>1.  There needs to be some sort of legally-required opt-in for authors, artists, and other creatives in order for their works to be used to train AI, preferably with individual companies having to work directly with creators in order to gain permission.<br/>2.  Works produced by AI cannot be copyrightable.
