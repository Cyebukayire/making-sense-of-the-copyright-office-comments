As a creative and a developer, the knowledge that AI generators are trained off of my work is incredibly disturbing and disgusting to me. In terms of copyright it is detrimental to protecting my work, and outright theft in the most blatant of cases - where AI can be commanded to &quot;create an artwork in the style of X,&quot; to create an image of my likeness, to recreate something I have done. It also has had a direct impact on many of my creative colleagues, who have seen their positions lost in favor of AI generation; and if left unchecked it will devastate an entire market and cause growth to completely stagnate. In no uncertain terms, I DO NOT support copyright protections for AI generative work. Copyright at its core ideally protects the works of creatives and allows them to be credited and compensated for their efforts. AI generations are the works of machines that can only ever EMULATE, NEVER CREATE.
