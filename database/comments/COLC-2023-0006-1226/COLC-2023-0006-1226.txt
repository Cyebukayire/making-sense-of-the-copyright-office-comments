As a writer and editor, and someone who is friends with other writers and artists, I&#39;m appalled by the way AI is being used without any consideration for the rights of artists. I know that, in the current climate, there is no legal or practical way to prevent my words from being scraped by bots and used as raw materials for AI, and I hate it. I did not consent to this, and I know that the horse is already out of the barn. I&#39;m afraid that employers will no longer want to employ writers or editors because they can use AI instead, and I will be out of a career.
