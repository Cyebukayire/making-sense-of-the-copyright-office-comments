If you weren&#39;t already planning to, a law should be made that makes using AI generated text to respond to notices like these illegal.<br/><br/>I would wager an absurd amount of AI generated comments have already been submitted in an attempt to drown out the people of this country with millions of false voices.<br/><br/>More directly on topic, this is the practical danger you need to consider: are you willing to waste limited resources protecting the explosion of copyrights produced by granting copyrights to AI generated content? are you willing to dig through the rising mud that such protections would create? do you have a plan for when a &quot;change the homework a little&quot; algorithm is developed allowing for the laundering of plagiarized text so that authors may be undercut by mass-produced counterfeits? <br/><br/>On the other side of things, the more emotional side of the argument, the act of creation should not be subject to mass production.<br/>I will not accept a future in which art is made a slave to be bought and sold.<br/><br/>in conclusion, do you want to replace artistic jobs with jobs filling out paperwork? because that&#39;s the future offered by AI if creativity is not the protected domain of people.
