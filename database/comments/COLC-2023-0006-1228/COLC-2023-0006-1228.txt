AI as we have it right now is not &quot;intelligence&quot;, so to say. It&rsquo;s an intelligent programme, if anything. It learns from others, starting with whatever humans fed them. but now we already see AI learning from AI, leading to faulty results. <br/>As a content creator, writer and artist, I see friends and colleagues calling out art theft committed by AI left and right. If it doesnt steal art, it steals intellectual property, say ideas, faces or voices (though I&lsquo;m unsure faces or voices would necessarily be considered intellectual property or something similar). The dangers of AI heavily outweigh the benefits, putting artists and creative content providers at incredible risk. AI bots flood the internet, scanning fanfictions, fanart, original fiction, I have even seen cases of it scanning autobiographies, using the ideas and phrases word by word. <br/>ChatGPT for examples scans fanfiction, without informing or asking the creator for permission, therefore stealing those ideas. The authors often only find out due to someone from their community recognising that work and reporting it. <br/>The website providers most of the time do nothing about it. <br/>(Voice) Actors have their voices stolen, used for a short Tiktok clip. When those videos go viral, they dont see a penny of the royalties, instead it all goes to the person behind that account. <br/>Tiktok most of the time does nothing about it. <br/>Claim what you want about &quot;the evil chinese website&quot; but it&lsquo;s not like American based websites do any different. <br/><br/>AI hurts already underpaid artists, it hurts creators, authors, musicians, everyone who&rsquo;s ever created something.
