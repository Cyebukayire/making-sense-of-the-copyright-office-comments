My name is Helen Shang, and I&rsquo;m a professional writer. I write TV, movies, stories, and way too many tweets and comments like these than I would like to admit. I&rsquo;m writing to you now to urge you to please regulate the use of AI, so that creators like myself can stop having our works stolen and plagiarized by companies in the name of artificial intelligence. Left unchecked, AI will hurt this country&rsquo;s artists, and hurt this country&rsquo;s culture of artistic creativity.<br/><br/>I have always felt that copyright laws in the US have been fairly strong. Because of the Copyright Act, I know that any scripts or stories I write are automatically copyrighted by me, even if they haven&rsquo;t been officially published. I know that if I post, say, a short story online, it&rsquo;s a copyright violation for someone to plagiarize it, and I have legal recourse to protect myself. Because of these laws, I and others feel empowered to do things like take creative risks and share our work with the world. All that is changing with the rise of AI. I feel that AI programs are greatly harming artists like myself by taking publicly accessible copyrighted works, plagiarizing them without our permission, and making derivative products without compensating us. <br/><br/>Right now, there are several episodes of TV that I have written that are legally available online, along with decades&rsquo; worth of my pictures, art and written material. Firstly, I feel in the dark because I do not know if AI programs have scrubbed the things I&rsquo;ve made, and if so, which AI programs have done so, and what it&rsquo;s being used for. Under the current copyright law, creators have the right to authorize who gets to take their material to make derivative works. I strongly urge the Government to enact transparency laws for AI companies to be open about what sources they are taking for their databases.<br/><br/>Secondly, I believe that the use of AI exploits artists financially. We have already seen this happen with for-profit photo AI apps, which take existing artists&rsquo; artwork without their permission to make AI pictures, without giving any compensation to the artists whose artwork they are using. As a writer, I don&rsquo;t want this stealing to also happen to the written word. As a WGA member, my union is currently on strike against the AMPTP, and one of the things we&rsquo;re fighting for is fair AI use. I feel that if we continue unregulated down this road, companies can use AI programs to write scripts (off databases compiled without our permission with material that we wrote), and then hire human writers to revise these faulty scripts &ndash; only instead of paying us at the first draft rate, they would pay us at the much lower revision rate. Writers like me will make a lot less money, and ironically, and the work we have done in the past would be actively harming the money we make in the present!<br/><br/>For me, it&rsquo;s not a matter of whether or not people like AI-generated material or not. I don&rsquo;t want companies using things I&rsquo;ve made without my permission, and making money off of it to boot. AI is not true artificial intelligence that can think for itself &ndash; it needs to be fed new human-made stories and art so that the quality of its generated output doesn&rsquo;t degrade when AI content learns from AI content. The feedback loop is called model collapse and it&rsquo;s already happening. What this tells me is that AI needs fresh new human content in order to survive, that we artists are necessary for it to function. So isn&rsquo;t that reason enough to for us human artists to have a say in what our material is used for?<br/><br/>I urge the Government to enact updated copyright laws around the ethical use of AI, and to strongly advocate for the work of human artists. The United States is currently a world leader in culture, entertainment and creativity: creative minds from this country have made movies and songs and art that people from all corners of the globe recognize and love. And I strongly believe this is in part due to the fact that we have these robust copyright laws that support a culture of creativity over copying. If these laws don&rsquo;t cover AI, I fear that the vibrant creative life in this country will be made to atrophy away to something derivative and dull. As a writer, the threat of having my livelihood being taken away by AI and knowing my work may be stolen with no consequence will disincentivize me to create and share my art with the public. Do we want to be a country that values unique expressions of the human soul, or a country that generates content? Please do the right thing and regulate.
