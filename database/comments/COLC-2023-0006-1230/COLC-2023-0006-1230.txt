The line between human created work and computer/software created work should be made clear. From there, copyrights should only apply to human created work. Saving copyright for human created work will keep tech/corporations from exploiting this new technology at the expense of artists and other creators. Most AI is trained on existing copyrighted works in some capacity and is unable to cite properly the works used. I feel it&rsquo;s fine to explore AI generated works and experiment with technology, but one should not be able to profit from the output of that technology. The steps taken now can ensure we don&rsquo;t hand over all our art and entertainment to corporations looking for cheap solutions
