AI software trained on copyrighted material should have no copyright protections of its own. Using copyrighted work without agreement from both parties is already an infringement. Mass data scalping has resulted in generative programs that are now being sold to clients, both private and corporate. Thus, the creative works stolen and used without permission are already being used for profit. A program is not a person, and the person &quot;creating&quot; generations using the program relies on the program&#39;s robust library of stolen material to piece together an image matching the prompts. <br/><br/>Please be advised to begin investigating the development and use of AI vocal data banks, which use vocal clips of individuals without their consent, and can be used in conjunction with &quot;deep-fakes&quot; to cause personal and corporate damages. Identity theft, impersonation, and piracy are already codified as crimes. The unauthorized use of a person&#39;s very being, their face, their voice, their signature, their social security number, is an infringement of an individual&#39;s autonomy. Is that not a violation of an individual&#39;s human rights? Do we not hold the right to self-determination? That right encompasses the right to learn a creative medium or talent, invest time and money honing it, and de facto legal jurisdiction over distribution, monetization, and representation, hereinto abiding by the United State of America&#39;s Code of Laws. <br/><br/>These generative programs cannot exist without the data created by human beings. I believe the only case where AI generative works could be copyrighted is if: the user can prove that they have not generated material using the data of stolen copyrighted material. If users wish to generate copyrightable material, then it should only apply to AI programs using data sets that have obtained the legal agreement of EACH AND EVERY copyright holder for use of their creations. If the AI programs cannot create generations without illegally obtained copyrighted material, then by their very nature are not creating anything original or of artistic merit that requires copyright protections.
