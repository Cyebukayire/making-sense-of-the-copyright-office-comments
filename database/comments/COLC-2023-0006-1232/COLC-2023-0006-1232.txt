Artificial Intelligence (as it&#39;s incorrectly named -- there&#39;s nothing intelligent about it) is a series of programing that scrapes from other&#39;s creative endeavors. The only way that it works is by breaking copyright on hundreds of thousands of novels, articles, illustrations, comics, and whatever visual and written art that is fed into it. It&#39;s is made up of theft of intellectual property and labor. If copyright is meant to protect artists,creatives, innovators and scientists, then it should not apply to content that&#39;s created by stealing the work of actual people. &quot;AI&quot; cannot create anything new. It can only regurgitate what it&#39;s been programmed with.  Without regulation, artists, writers, and other creatives will be replaced in their jobs by generative software that only works because of the work that they&#39;ve put in.<br/><br/>Defenders of the programmers like to say that it&#39;s democratizing art, which is untrue, because art as a hobby, a pastime, and labor is something that has always been democratized. And it&#39;s ironic that they say that it&#39;s a &quot;democracy&quot; when it only works because of theft. I didn&#39;t come from a wealthy family, but I&#39;ve always written and I&#39;ve always drawn. It didn&#39;t matter how cheap the supplies, I was able to hone my craft and teach myself how to create. I don&#39;t want to be replaced by a computer program. I don&#39;t want the work I do to fuel a computer program built to replace me.<br/><br/>Right now, the Writers Guild of America is striking and one of their negotiation points is that they want protections from AI. They want their jobs protected from being replaced. I&#39;m working to become a television writer, and I would love to join the WGA one day. I want my future career to be protected. As a consumer, I don&#39;t want my entertainment to be created by an algorithm and have writers and actors exploited to create that entertainment.<br/><br/>
