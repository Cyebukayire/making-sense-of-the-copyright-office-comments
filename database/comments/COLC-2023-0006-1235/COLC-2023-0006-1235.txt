Thank you for seeking public input on this important issue!<br/><br/>As a professional writer and editor with over a decade of experience handling IP rights/licensing and content management, it is my firm belief that AI-generated content should NOT be copyrightable.<br/><br/>There are many reasons for this, but the two most prominent are:<br/><br/>1. The content is not being generated by a &quot;person&quot; in any legally (or logically) recognizable sense of the word. The Copyright Office found in 2014 that works created by nonhuman animals aren&#39;t subject to copyright protection. Animals at least have some level of consciousness and willful intent; what is currently referred to as &quot;AI&quot; does not even possess that. It has no intent, no self-awareness, no concept of what it is doing, and it is neither a conscious being nor a legal entity capable of holding rights or property for itself or anyone else. If a &quot;creative&quot; work by an animal is not eligible for copyright protection, why would a work generated by an algorithm tied to a database? <br/><br/>2. The content *is* being derived from the (sometimes protected) work of others. LLMs such as ChatGPT work by collecting and analyzing a massive database of existing works, then extrapolating the elements of those works that are most likely to fulfill user-specified parameters. For example, if an image-generating AI is asked to render a bearded man in a blue suit sitting on a bench, it scours the database of works it has collected for ones that contain one or more of the specified elements, identifies the common elements/patterns, then generates a work based on those common elements. The resultant work is a an amalgam&mdash;a derivative of all of the relevant works in its database, most of which were collected without permission and without the proper authorization or attribution for reproduction or creation of derivative works.
