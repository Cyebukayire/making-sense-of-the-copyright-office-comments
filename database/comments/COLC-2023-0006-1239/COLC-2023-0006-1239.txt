AI is a tool to be used and AI content is derivative of the work it uses to generate it&#39;s content--not understanding exactly how AI works under the surface does not exclude it from the creator or the user generating the content from being accountable for its actions.<br/><br/>At the same time, AI work should not be copyrightable, as its use will inevitably decrease the artistic value and individualism of human work. I do not see any societal benefit for allowing AI content to be copyrightable at this time. It should not be copyrightable unless there is clear benefit for society to do so, in which case exceptions may be made.<br/>
