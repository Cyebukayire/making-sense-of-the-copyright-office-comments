Hello, I speak for all creative individuals and artists who are allowing copyright on AI work that directly violates current copywritten work because AI takes user information and data from existing media. The media it uses is stolen and takes work from individuals and companies WITHOUT consent. There are little to no regulations for AI, and it has stolen work from small individual creators and major corporations like the Walt Disney Company. Many giant corporations are using AI without realizing they are using other creators&#39; work, leaving a big loophole in copyright. It is not fair or legal to stay another person&#39;s work, so why should it be legal during AI? If I trace Mickey Mouse on paper and say he is my original character and sell merchandise of him, I can get sued, but the Walt Disney Company can use my art and work in AI and make a profit out of it. How is it fair to make copyright of AI when it is using other copywritten works? Artificial intelligence can replicate the voices of political figures perfectly, and if that work could get copywritten there could be some serious consequences. There have been multiple cases of people being fooled by the AI work of former President Donald Trump and current President Joseph Biden. Please stand with artists and creators and do not let AI be copywritten. Thank you for your time.
