Copyright &quot;protects original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture&quot; (copyright.gov). Anything a machine generates to mimic one of the above does not deserve copyright protection as it is simply a mimic. It is not an original work. A human being did not create it. No effort by a human being is put forth when AI creates something, you simply provide a prompt to a machine, which can be as short as one word. These AI works use information from human sources, almost always without their consent, to create a facsimile of their art style, writing style, musical style, voice, or anything else. By this, the creation of AI works is in violation of copyright protection for those authors, artists, performers, and creators.<br/>Unless the person or organization using the AI tool to generate works can GUARANTEE that all the works the AI tool was trained on are owned by that person or organization, AI works should never have ANY legal protections.
