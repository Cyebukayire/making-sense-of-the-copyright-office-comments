AI should not have copyright protection. Far too many AIs are made by stealing the creations of others (artists, writers, musicians) to &#39;learn from&#39;. Anything that is made from stolen content should not be in widespread use and profited off it, much less given copyright protection when so much of how AI for creative purposes (even if it&#39;s just writing/chatting from AI) is done by violating the copyright of real people and their creations. This article (https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/is-ai-art-stealing-from-artists) does a good job of looking into this problem with comments from artists who have been affected through AI being trained on their art without permission. <br/><br/>AI is not transformative work. It steals the original content, often without permission or notification, then copies it over and over while mixing in other stolen content. Art generating AIs especially are instructed to create piece that look similar to specific artists&#39; work; users force the AI to use the existing, copyrighted content to blend those pieces together in order to fulfill the command. Stolen work, and anything made from stolen work, should not have copyright protection. That copyright protection should be for the original artist first and foremost; these laws should be made to protect the real people who are creating art, not the machine that is fed stolen work.
