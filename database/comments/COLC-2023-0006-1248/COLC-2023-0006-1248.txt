Hello, I am an independent artist and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/><br/>This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse.<br/><br/>Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense. Leaving them unregulated and free to profit from the work of humans, without consent, will however be detrimental to the Arts. Creatives will hide the things that make society great out of fear that the things they have created will be mined by big corporations for profit.<br/><br/>This is for any creative endeavor. Anything not created by a human should not be open to be copyrighted as it takes ownership of something it did not create by stealing parts of it without the work being put into it.<br/><br/>Above all, art is Work. Art is human expression. To allow AI works to be copyrighted will allow the beauty of human expression to be lost in a flood of art created strictly as a cash-grab by businesses. That is not Art.<br/><br/>As an artist, I am against AI work being able to be copyrighted, and am for very strict regulations on what sources they are allowed to mine their data from and that they must always gain explicit consent. This should include making all databases reset as there are known lawsuits where they have mined without consent.
