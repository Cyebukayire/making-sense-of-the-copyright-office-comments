Simply put, copyrighted works should not be used for AI training without explicit consent from the copyright holder. To do so violates their intellectual property, taking their work to make similar work, requiring little to no human effort. To allow it to go on this way would be wrong, and threaten the livelihoods of many who rely on their work to survive. Those who disagree with me would argue that this is no different to a human brain taking inspiration from a work to create something new, but the reality is that there is no human brain involved, which is the crux of the issue. AI makes generating copycat work easy, and in many cases effortless. There is no &quot;inspiration&quot; occurring, for there is no mind to inspire, it is simply chopping up bits of a work to move them around a little and pass it off as their own, reducing people and their work to little more than a template that makes the original human being redundant, invalidating the jobs and other general niches of many. For this reason, this cannot be allowed to go on.
