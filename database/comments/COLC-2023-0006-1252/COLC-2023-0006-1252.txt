Copyright exists to protect the intellectual property and creative output of individuals. The current policy requiring people to be involved in the creative process to ascribe copyright to them for their work is a common-sense policy objective. Just as copyright holders have the right to restrict use of their work in commercial usage, they should have the right to restrict the use of their work in training AI or other programs that have commercial applications, and to see compensation for the output of such programs or algorithms that are derived from their input.
