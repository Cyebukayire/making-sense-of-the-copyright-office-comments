I work a lot with software documentation at a global software company based in the United States, and just a few weeks ago at least seven people were let go from their positions working on help documentation across the entire product family. I fear this is a result of the tech industry&rsquo;s increasing reliance on AI (built up by scraping the existing work of hundreds of thousands of people who shared and published content online) and contributing to a loss of jobs and consequently a loss of domain expertise and knowledge of the craft of writing. As a young adult early in their career, I fear I could be next. I can&rsquo;t afford that.
