A.I. should kept under a tight leash given how exploitable it is. It might already be too late when something critical happens due to a lack of regulation; maybe something that can&#39;t be backpedaled on. Self-employed artists can have their livelihoods compromised due to how (A.I. Art generation for example) uses copyrighted existing works that can generate an image for profit or nefarious ends. I&#39;m not saying A.I. generation of stuff is bad/morally wrong; but again, I believe it needs to kept on a tight leash
