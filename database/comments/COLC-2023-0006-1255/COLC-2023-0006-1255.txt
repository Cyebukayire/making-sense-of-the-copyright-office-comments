Companies and individuals utilizing artificial intelligence to generate new media from existing media will be the slow death of the arts. It&rsquo;s frustrating to see that actual people who are artists, actors, and voice actors are slowly losing their livelihood to software that utilizes others&rsquo; work to create something new. Hollywood&rsquo;s push to digitally clone background actors is disgusting and an individual&rsquo;s likeness should not be available to duplicate without explicit written permission. Along those lines, assets produced by artists and actors should not be used to train or otherwise stand as a model for technology that is intended to replace them. Regulations are the only thing protecting the arts from this slippery slope and the US government has the power to establish guidelines to protect creators.
