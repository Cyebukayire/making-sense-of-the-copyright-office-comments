I&rsquo;ve spent twenty years learning to write. When AI are trained on my work, it&rsquo;s not merely the content that&rsquo;s being stolen&mdash;it&rsquo;s my skill, my talent, my training. It&rsquo;s twenty plus years of practice and refinement and honing my craft. An AI trained on the stolen work of authors and artists isn&rsquo;t just theft&mdash;it devalues the effort I&rsquo;ve put in to create that work. There&rsquo;s no way to ethically have AI-produced content without it shamelessly appropriating others&rsquo; intellectual property; and the labor that went into making it.
