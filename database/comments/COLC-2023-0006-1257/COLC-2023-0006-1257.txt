Generative AI is almost always trained using the products of actual hard working artists without their knowledge or consent. Speaking as an artist myself, AI companies should be required to license any work they wish to use for training purposes at a fair rate at the bare minimum, with retroactive licensing agreements required for any model that has used such works in the past. Artists should have the right to protect their work from this blatant thievery. With regards to copyright, AI works should not be allowed to be copyrightable at all considering that they are based on stolen work and require little to no human interaction to create. Even considering these generations &quot;art&quot; is a disservice to the hard working artists that are being exploited by those with little to no interest in learning how to actually create something.
