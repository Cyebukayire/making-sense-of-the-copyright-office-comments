I think it&#39;s very hurtful for artists and writers alike, even actors faces and voices are used to train AI, allmost all of the times without permission.<br/>No piece could ever be truly &#39;yours&#39; in this regard because AI could pick up on certain mannerisms and copy that in it&#39;s &#39;own&#39; work.<br/>I think AI should be used for the medical field and to make Chat GPT better. Chat GPT has lots off possibilities, so I suggest put your funding and tweaking there, and make it not harmfull for people, and their incomes.
