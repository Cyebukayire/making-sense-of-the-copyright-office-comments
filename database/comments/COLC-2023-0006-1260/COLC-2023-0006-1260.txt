As an artist, I think work produced using AI engines that scrape art without the original artist&#39;s consent and incorporate it into something new should not be copyrightable. I don&#39;t think AI engines should be able to scrape art, literature, and so on without consent in the first place, especially not to then turn around and make a profit.
