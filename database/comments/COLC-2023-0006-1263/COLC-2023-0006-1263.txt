Let&rsquo;s be honest and call AI what it really is. It&rsquo;s not Artificial Intelligence. It&rsquo;s Plagiarism Software. It scours the internet or information that it&rsquo;s fed. Information that was generated by other users/writers/artists/photographers and steals it to &ldquo;create&rdquo; its own version. This should be treated no differently than if someone stole the footage from Star Wars and changed the title to Space Fights and slapped their name on it. When Vanilla Ice stole the underlying beat from Queen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Under Pressure&rdquo; we were smart enough then to know it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;created&rdquo;. It was stolen. It&rsquo;s the same for AI.
