Allowing AI to use copyrighted content without permission is an unfair use. It&#39;s not the same as a human reading and learning from other humans. It&#39;s more akin to copying designs with minimal changes and calling it your own work. Allowing AI to train on copyrighted work will have deleterious effects on human creativity, progress, and livelihoods.
