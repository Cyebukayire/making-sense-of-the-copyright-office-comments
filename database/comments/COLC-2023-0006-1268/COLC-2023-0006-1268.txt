As you mention, creative works generated by a machine learning algorithm trained on others&#39; works do not constitute human works and therefore should not be copyrightable. It is similar to remixes in that it transforms the work of another individual, but an algorithm does not consider fair use, harm, or consent. The technology is sound and can be useful for accessibility outside creative works. The problem is not so much whether generative works based on others&#39; works can be copyrightable, because that question is easily answered. The question becomes, are generative works based on others&#39; works without their consent infringing on existing copyright? These generative AI algorithms use images and texts under copyright in a way that reproduces them without attribution or legal agreement. By allowing these algorithms to use others&#39; works in this way, we are basically saying that copyright does not protect works. This harms creators. Imagine if a generative algorithm trained on Disney works created a film that is indistinguishable from any other Disney film. What if this was used to confuse fans into thinking they are buying a Disney film? Disney has the resources to fight such infringement, but smaller creators do not. If you think this is unlikely, Jane Friedman, former editor of Writer&#39;s Digest, had this very thing happen to her, as I am sure your office is aware of. When making your decisions, please consider who is being harmed and who is using that harm for personal gain.
