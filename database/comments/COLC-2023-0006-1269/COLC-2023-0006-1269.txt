Generative AI such as ChatGPT is a technology developed surreptitiously using illegally obtained and distributed intellectual property. I saw the Books3 cache cited in the Meta/Facebook research paper referred to in the Sarah Silverman lawsuit. Hosted at the time by AI developer Shawn Presser on his website the-eye.au, that cache held HUNDREDS of books that were being offered illicitly on the internet for years for one purpose: to develop ChatGPT. No matter what happens going forward, the technology itself was created by violating the copyright of numerous authors. The magnitude of copyright violation in the development of this technology alone is staggering. If it continues to be developed, it must be through not only consent from but also compensation to the authors in question. I urge the office to consider any use of copyrighted material to train generative AI as a violation with a minimum penalty of substantial value. I ask this because the technology WILL be used to earn extraordinary profits for the corporations and individuals who violated those rights. I also ask the office to consider that nothing generated fundamentally by a machine be copyrightable, nor by that same reasoning should anything generated fundamentally by a machine be considered transformative. Attached is a screenshot I took of a VERY SMALL sample of the books that were in Books3. Imagine at least 10x this many illegally distributed books were used to train ChatGPT. I believe you will have your answer.
