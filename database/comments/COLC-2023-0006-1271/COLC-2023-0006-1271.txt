As a current copywriter and author in the state of California, I am concerned with the unregulated use of AI due to threats to copyright and financial livelihoods. Copyright law aims to protect human creativity and human ideas, as well as promote the progress of science and useful arts, so AI should not be protected under copyright and also should not have access to copyrighted materials to train models. If AI is left unregulated, it will threaten working creatives and fail to provide sufficient incentive for copyright holders and innovators to pursue scientific progress and artful creation. Reasonable regulations will help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible, while still protecting copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever.
