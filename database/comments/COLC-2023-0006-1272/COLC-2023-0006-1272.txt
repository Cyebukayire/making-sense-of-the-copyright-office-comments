I am an artist based in Melbourne, Australia. It has been a difficult decade and I have barely managed to survive as an artist, thanks to the Australian government I am. I am writing to voice my concerns over the use of my art being used without permission to generate content for AI art generation companies and their users. AI needs to be regulated! This is not just a local issue this is a global issue! Artists create unique content to be enjoyed by millions which adds to the Happiness Index of each country. Instead of letting people steal their work and selling it off as their own we should be punishing and regulating these companies who at the moment have free rein, things are already getting out of hand and people are losing their lives over it. This is a matter not just for job security but global security, we need to do something now! Attached is some screenshots of my art which has been used to generate AI Art without my permission, I don&#39;t get any money for this, no compensation, not even acknowledgement, it is unfair and unjust. Please do something and show us that you care.
