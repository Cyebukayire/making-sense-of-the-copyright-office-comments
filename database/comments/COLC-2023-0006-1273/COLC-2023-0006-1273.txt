What we have now is not AI. What we have now is an algorithm gorging itself on freely, easily findable and stealable copyrighted material and spitting it out again in different amalgamations. It is not intelligent. It is no more of a creative process than asking a magic 8 ball to answer your questions. <br/><br/>What is now called &quot;AI art&quot; needs to be legislated into oblivion. It is only working to steal money from those whose works are already disrespected and unvalued - and god forbid if studios are given the ok to use this. I don&#39;t want to see more &quot;AI&quot; generated dead artists pranced across a movie screen. I don&#39;t want scripts or art or news articles created by a slime mold of a program oozing across the internet for content where no one was paid. <br/><br/>There need to be actions taken to aggressively protect creative works and thoroughly denounce &quot;AI&quot; work as what it is: just the latest in a series of tech pyramid schemes waiting to steal from anyone it can. This is not the next great thing. It is a scam. Do not allow it to grow, or we will watch the careers of every creative person in the world go up in smoke so some tech bro MLM bastards can buy another lambo.
