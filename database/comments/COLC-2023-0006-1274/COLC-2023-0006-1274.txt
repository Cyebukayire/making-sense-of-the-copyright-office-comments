Before considering whether the output of Artificial Intelligence is copyrightable, we must first acknowledge that &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is, at least in its current form, a misnomer. No AI system is capable of creating something new, only combining what it has been trained on (often without the consent of the creator of the trained material). The current systems are merely advanced examples of mimicry. Artificial Intelligence may be more capable in some regards, but it is substantially no different from a mockingbird at its core. It has long been established that animals may not hold copyright, nor may a human copyright the creation of an animal. We should treat the output of Artificial Intelligence no differently.
