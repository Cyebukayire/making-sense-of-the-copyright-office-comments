Anything made by AI should not be copyrightable as it is a machine creating not a person. And any AI that is trained using the images and property of other people should not be allowed, especially for commercial use or for anything that involves personal gain. This is because it directly steals the style, work, and thought that the creator of the works put into it own, and have spent many hours on.
