Given the black box nature of generative AI, it seems prudent to treat it as a breach of copyright for any AI that does not publicly release the contents of its training set. These sets often contain copyrighted material without the consent of the owner, allowing the AI to use and reproduce it. This is a horrible precedent to set, and needs to be heavily regulated.<br/><br/>However, if a generative AI does publicly share its training model as proof that it does not contain any materials that owner of the AI does not have permission to use, then the AI should not be considered a breach of copyright, and any materials generated should be able to be copyrighted as normal by its creator.
