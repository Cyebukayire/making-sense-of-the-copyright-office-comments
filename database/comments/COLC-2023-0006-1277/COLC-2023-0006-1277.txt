As a rule, I would consider allowing any creative works of mine, as they are mine, to be scraped by AI systems for iterative replication, pending my deciding to give consent for their doing so with my created works. If they co-opt my creative works without my consent, using it as a component to generating their creations is against my wishes and my consent for my created works, thus the theft of my creative works for their use in the creation of product that not only is done without my permission, but which has the insidious effect of displacing my participation within the shared creative space for employment with no compensation provided to me nor even inquired as to what compensation I would deem appropriate for the use of my creative works. I do not abide the theft of my works, especially when used without my consent to undermine the marketplace for my creative works in the process of using them. Nor will I allow the theft of any other properly of mine to be used without my consent, especially when undermining the viability of that which they&#39;ve stolen from me, such is taking parts of my house away from me and building their own structures, taking parts of my transportation vehicle away from me, and building their own mode of transportation, breaking into my garage to steal my tools for their use without my consent, etc. . Theft of what I create and what I and use of what I create and what I own without my explicitly being asked for along with my granting permission will not be accepted by me.<br/>
