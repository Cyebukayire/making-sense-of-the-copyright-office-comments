All AI is based on copyright violations. For quite a while now they based all the &ldquo;learning&rdquo; on feeding copyrighted materials to the machines, mostly without consent from copyright holders. The works AI programs offer as new, aren&rsquo;t really - they are based on what has been fed to them. There is no originality with AI, everything has to come from something. Therefore it&rsquo;s impossible to grant AI works a copyright.
