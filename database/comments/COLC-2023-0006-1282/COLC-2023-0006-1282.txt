Copying a writer&rsquo;s work and utilizing that content without their express permission is an abusive practice that must never be tolerated, much less adopted as a norm. Attempting to understate the criminality/unfairness of their actions by changing the phrasing from &quot;copied from&quot; to &quot;informed by&quot; is a complete perversion of the principles of owning the copyright to one&#39;s own work and economically catastrophic and detrimental to writers and other human creatives.<br/><br/>In the first place, there is no actual &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; involved here. Computer programs do not presently have the capability to think or discern right from wrong. Let us please not keep pretending that the technologies being touted at artificial &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; are more than glorified search engines that have the capability to scrape the internet stealing the product of our creative labors. <br/><br/>The sad fact is that the technology being called artificial intelligence could be inherently useful to humans but its potential usefulness has been perverted by bad actors attempting to give people the impression that this technology is capable of thinking and producing original content and ideas. It is certainly not. <br/><br/>In reality, all we have are Terrible Humans seeking to take unfair advantage of and profit unethically from the labors of other humans, i.e. writers and other creatives, while shifting all accountability for their ill deeds to non-human entities.<br/><br/>Under no circumstances do I, personally, wish to acquiesce to the selfish kind of sophistry and twisted logic that demands that my creative work is fair game for the use of individuals or corporations bent on profiting obscenely from the product of my labors without fairly compensating me. <br/><br/>Copying and utilizing my creative work, for any purpose, without my consent&mdash;not to mention without properly compensating me for it&ndash;is theft. It only stands to reason that such actions/behavior should be strictly prohibited.<br/>
