I don&#39;t have anything positive to say about Artificial Intelligence as a creative medium. I do have two negative things to say. The first is, my understanding of how data mining works is that AI builds directly from a library of existent works. If it is going to do this, the source that AI &quot;mines&quot; needs to be in the public domain- or rightfully compensated. The second issue I have is with the carbon emissions that come from the computer processing power required to run AI. Even if a legally agreeable library of data could be arranged, the ecological footprint needs to be taken into consideration and regulated. Thanks for your time and service!
