Greetings - I want to specifically address parts questions 6, 7 and 18 while also providing insight onto how training is done, the implications of differing copyright reforms around AI, and help the copyright office better understand this process in hopes of paving the way forward for better decision making.<br/><br/>Attached to this response are the answers to those questions.  While I have made a best effort to keep these answers as short as they can be, this is a complex space in technology and there is substantial context involved in the process of training and utilizing models.  <br/><br/>Feel free contact me if you have any follow-up questions!
