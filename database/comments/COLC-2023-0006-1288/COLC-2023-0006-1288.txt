I am severely disappointed in the lack of oversight over the new wave of AI. These AIs are stealing art, both the visual, auditory, and written kind, to create new &ldquo;artworks.&rdquo; But this should be unacceptable, they are stealing other people&rsquo;s livelihoods and their works. It is also creating issues with the legibility of the internet. AIs are now being used in a number of programs such as Google Search and grammar &amp; spelling checkers. Most of these programs have become noticeably worse after the introduction of AI. It has not added many benefits to the internet or to the world and what little it has added does not outweigh the harm it&rsquo;s doing.
