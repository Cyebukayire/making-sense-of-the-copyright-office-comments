Copyrights belong first to the person who creates a thing. We can then sell them, or such, to another, sure, but that initial right belongs to the creator.<br/><br/>A machine has no ownership rights, how can it choose to transfer them to anyone else? How can we allow people to gain copyrights for things they did not create without the consent of the creator?<br/><br/>I can&#39;t copyright a flower. I put in work for it to grow, maybe, butI didn&#39;t create it directly. What has the right to sell me the copyrights to the flower? Nothing, so I can&#39;t have that. That is not what copyright is for.<br/><br/>There are ways in which copyrights are already too easily abused. Allowing copyright on AI generated works makes those existing abuses worse.<br/><br/>I can see an argument that code can be copyrighted - butby that reasoning, all art created with software belongs to the owners of the codebase. We already know that the maker of a tool does not then own everything made with that tool.<br/><br/>So the question becomes, how do we draw lines between the use of a tool, and automation? To say nothing of the training data sources under copyright! What is influence, what is fair use, and what is plagiarism?<br/><br/>How is a person to prove they put in the work?<br/><br/>And most immediately, how are workers to be compensated fairly if their work can simply be stolen by an AI which cannot itself be held accountable? <br/><br/>
