Hello, I am a freelance artist and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. Because the current state of AI tools unethically trains their datasets on already existing copyrighted works, users of the tools claim that what they make is theirs even though they didn&#39;t create the original works that it&#39;s trained on. Considering that they can churn out hundreds of works per day, they are also threatening to take away the livelihoods of independent artists, freelance artists, voice over actors, and more for little to no pay and will cause many creative professionals to live an unsustainable life in an already unsustainable economy. Please consider regulating Artificial Intelligence to protect all human-made work.
