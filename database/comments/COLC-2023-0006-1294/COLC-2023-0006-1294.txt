Writers work hard to come up with stories, poems, screenplays, lyrics, articles, blogs, and even social media posts inspired by their lives, backgrounds, histories, psychology and imaginations. AI models scrape the work of these passionate and diverse creators, the vast majority who have not consented to have their work used this way, to teach large language models what writing is. The AI models take all this ill-gotten data, mix it up, and regurgitate it into a facsimile of human writing, creating nothing new or original, scraping the imaginations and lived human experience of real writers.
