AI is a danger to artists and privacy, and should be treated as such. While AI has recently been ruled as un-copyright-able, it needs to go further. It must be codified as soon as possible, so that another administration or Supreme Court can&rsquo;t easily legitimize it. AI can be beneficial as a tool, used in specific parameters, by a person, but not to replace a person. AI is also currently being used as a Trojan horse almost, in the sense that these companies are collecting user data and using it however they like. Tech companies need to face stricter consequences for these privacy violations.
