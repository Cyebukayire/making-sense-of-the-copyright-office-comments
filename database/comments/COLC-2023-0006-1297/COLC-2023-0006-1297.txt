I am gravely worried about the effect the widespread use of this technology will have on my career and others&#39;, as well as on the future of art, and the privacy of those who use their image in art. stealing someone&#39;s face or voice to use to promote of enact things the individual has no will or choice over is a hellish nightmare we never dreamed we would see in the future. that machines can be used to make cheap, biases, basic dictated images rather than to pay a skilled individual to create unique art that moves the soul, this is not what automation was supposed to be for. we&#39;re outsourcing our art so that we can do less art and work more? what a hellish backwards world this is. please, step in as the government and make some sense out of this.
