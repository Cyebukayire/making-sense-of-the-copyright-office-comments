AI-generated art and writing should NOT be protected by copyright! All AI does is piece together stolen bits of art and writing into its own soulless amalgmation. There&#39;s no emotion, no real meaning in AI art and writing. It&#39;s the zombie plague of the creative world. We have to quarantine it now, before things get too out of hand.
