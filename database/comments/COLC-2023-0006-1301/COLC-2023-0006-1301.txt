AI cannot be copyrighted, and AI that utilizes nonconsensual pre-existing labor from humans (such as illustration, writing, and music) is a copyright violation itself and needs to be treated as such. It is not transformative, and does not fall under the fair use clause--because it is contingent upon malicious exploitation, and doesn&#39;t involve creative thought or labor by the person using the AI machine.
