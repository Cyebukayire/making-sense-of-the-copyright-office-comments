Hello, United States Copyright Office<br/><br/>I speak as a proud but concerned citizen of this nation and for many other of my fellow citizens that we do not wish to see any form of media content such as artworks, writing, film, and music to fall under copyright protection.<br/>We believe allowing such an action to take place would go completely against the American spirit of free enterprise and the protection of personal liberties. In our view, allowing content generated by artificial intelligence to fall under copyright protection would instead lead to the abuse of copyright law by large organizations and companies by using it as an iron baton against small independent creators, businesses, and rising companies. It would also cause immense and perhaps irreparable damage to America&#39;s beautiful and powerful artistic influence by leading to a homogenization of American content and drowning out new innovations under mass production. We also feel such an action if taken would be an existential threat to the financial security and personal liberty and happiness of tens of thousands of American writers, artists, film makers, and more as they would be out of a job replaced by cheap artificial intelligence. This would a total catastrophy for their lives and for the cultural fabric and health of this nation. <br/>As such we humbly ask that in your good wisdom and in keeping with the great traditions of this republic, you do not allow any content generated by artificial intelligence to fall under copyright law, and in so doing protect the great American cultural and artistic heart and landscape that has developed for over a century on its own.<br/><br/>From, a concerned Citizen
