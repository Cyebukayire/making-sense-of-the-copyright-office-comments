AI generated &quot;art&quot; does not deserve a copyright. An AI is not a human, nor a non-human person, and as such the outputs it creates ahouls not be considered works of art, nor even original creations, since it is impossible for a generative AI to make anything without first being fed a body of previously created art for it to pull from. Furthermore, the acquisition of man made art by corporations, without the express consent of the artist and with the purpose of training an AI model to replicate ther style should ABSOLUTELY be considered theft. These companies have no intention of reimbursing the artists, and every intention of using their AIs to attempt to replace the original artist within the market.if an artist is willing to sell their art to an AI corporation, then that is their right, but noone should need to worry about some scraper bot pulling their portfolio off their website, ingesting it and then using it to copy their style and works.  The current lack of regulation is both unethical and unacceptable, and we must act to prevent further damage to the world&#39;s community of artists, those who actually create novel intellectual property.
