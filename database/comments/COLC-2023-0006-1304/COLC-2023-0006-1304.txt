Currently, all artificial intelligence programs work by sampling art made by real human creators and re-mixing it into something different based on the prompt given to it by a user. Therefore, in my opinion it&rsquo;s no different than plagiarism because those original artists and writers are not being given credit for their contribution to the new AI-generated work, and in many cases are not informed or asked for their consent for their works to be used. The person who &ldquo;created&rdquo; the new ai work cannot rightfully be considered a copyright holder because in the end their contribution to its creation is minimal at best, negligible at worst. It&rsquo;s like claiming you own a number because you typed a formula into a calculator. <br/>In the same way that monkeys who click the shutter of a camera do not own the copyright to the photo taken, a computer cannot hold copyright to an image or prose, and a human who asked that computer to gather the data necessary to create said image cannot either.
