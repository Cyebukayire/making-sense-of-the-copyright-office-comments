I feel that AI created work should not be protected under copyright. I also feel that AI using someone else&#39;s work in its work without permission should also be seen as a violation. While there are times when using others&#39; work is protected (satire and other examples), using other people&#39;s work without their permission and passing it off as part of your own work is wrong. That being said, AI are not people, so do not take the previous sentence to point to my belief that they are. Their works also shouldn&#39;t be able to be copyrighted because they weren&#39;t created by a human, even if the AI was created by humans.
