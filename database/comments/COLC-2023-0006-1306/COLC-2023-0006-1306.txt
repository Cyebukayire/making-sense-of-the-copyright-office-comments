As a holder of several registered copyrights and trademarks for my creative work, I am greatly concerned about the impact oh AI-generated content on my ability to make a living. Potential clients will flock to use machines that have been trained on my work and the work of our peers without our knowledge or consent&mdash;because it is infinitely cheap and infinitely fast. What it isn&rsquo;t is a human creative act. Nor can any piece be repeated in the way I could draw you two of the same character, as AI output lacks artistic intent. A principled NO AI stance by the copyright office is one of the few possible bulwarks against a decimation of the creative industry. Thank you for your time!
