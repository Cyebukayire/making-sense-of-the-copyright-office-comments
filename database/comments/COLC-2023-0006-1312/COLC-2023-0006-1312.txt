My name is Sara. I write content for a large nonprofit that is run by, and benefits, autistic people. I have no doubt that my publicly available writing is being used to train AI. With multiple severe disabilities and a terminal illness, I have no other chance to make a living outside of the work I do now. I&rsquo;m essentially being forced to train my replacement, despite the fact that my work is copywrited and protected by my employer. Please, I&rsquo;m begging you. This would be illegal in any other context, and it&rsquo;s shocking that it&rsquo;s not a crime in this context. I&rsquo;m not begging for progress to stop. I&rsquo;m simply asking for justice to be done. Sincerely, Mrs. S.W.
