Hi, I am commenting as a concerned individual that is active in various communities involved in writing and creating content. Presently, our communities have been under attack by AI scraping and using our writing and art as &ldquo;training&rdquo; to teach AI and we did not consent or agree to this when posting our content. This is quite simply copying and stealing someone&rsquo;s work to then profit off of. This is especially abhorrent because a lot of the work we write and create are non profit and so to have AI profit off of something we wished to freely give to people, that we put our time and effort into, is disgusting. Furthermore the creator of the content should have the final say on where their writing or art goes and how it is used as we are the ones making it. If in the case of someone downloading a movie then clipping it into a short film and selling it for profit is not allowed then I do not think it is in any way shape or form reasonable to allow this behavior when it comes to written pieces of work and art. It is infringing on the rights of the creators to their own work.
