Hello. I am a writer and an artist, though amateur, and I find the whole AI situation odious. Nobody I&#39;ve discussed this with who is involved in the arts wants this to happen. People&#39;s stuff is just being taken and used without any consent or agreement or anything. It&#39;s incredibly demoralizing. Copyright is supposed to be about protecting an artist&#39;s work so that they may benefit from their own creations, but copyright means nothing if somehow AI programs can essentially circumvent everyone&#39;s copyrights entirely for someone else&#39;s benefit. <br/><br/>AI models essentially take everything anyone has ever worked on and uses them as if it were theirs. This is brazen plagiarism writ large and an insane violation of copyright for literally everyone who has ever made anything that at some point ended up on the internet for any reason. This includes every single show or film online, short stories, novels, biographies, research papers, textbooks, paintings, drawings, plays, etc. and even stuff that&#39;s in grey areas of copyright like fanfiction and fan art. And, unlike grey area works (where a larger culture has developed around monetary stuff to avoid legal issues), the ones pushing these AI programs and models are doing it explicitly to make massive amounts of money. <br/><br/>It applies to everyone&#39;s works, too- big companies, individual creators, everyone. What AI models have done is mass scale theft on a level that&#39;s nigh-incomprehensible. Just because someone stole from everyone doesn&#39;t magically make that not theft, yet that seems to be a prevailing impression among proponents of these technologies, which is asinine. Let alone the idea of it even being considered copyrightable in its own right. An absurdity! Rewarding theft because someone did it a LOT compared to others is a terrible idea. <br/><br/>That&#39;s not even getting into the other ethical mires with this technology, either, such as deepfakes (which is a nightmare when considering the issues of disinformation, and the issues surrounding autonomy of one&#39;s own image and voice- important for actors and performers) or the deliberate mimicry of specific artists&#39; works with these models (and the implications surrounding impersonation and how one&#39;s reputation is affected by such mimicry).
