I am of the belief that, should Artificial Intelligence (AI) become protected by copyright, it would make anyone who is not a large organization struggle a lot more in spreading their content and protecting their copyright. Especially if the AI scrapes all or near all of the relevant data - say if an author&#39;s existing work got scraped as a learning model for a public AI program, not only would anyone with access be able to generate a novel in the author&#39;s style, it would be protected by copyright and thus make it so much more difficult for the actual human being author to fight for their control over their content and their writing style and their own name. This extends to artists as well - with generative AI having scraped the majority of the internet without asking the permission of the owners or creators of images, a lot of people on the internet see the access to AI as a cheaper, faster way of getting art they want, and as AI has had no way of determining what was what in an image, the AI would copy a line of text that originally was the author&#39;s watermark, stealing some commission work from an artist that might need that would have been money to survive, and they can&#39;t fight for any profit made off that image because it would have been made by an AI and thus fall under copyright protection, despite it being modeled after their art style in place of them being commissioned themselves.<br/><br/>And some corporations (likely most big corporations who stand to profit from the use of AI and would further benefit from AI-generated content being copyrightable) are definitely going to want to push for any content generated by an AI program to be copyrighted. Why? Well, odds are it&#39;s to skimp out on paying actual humans who could do the work better, it would just take the human longer to do the work than the AI and that&#39;s all that those sorts of big companies care about - cold, hard cash. We&#39;re already seeing this with the joint Writers Guild Association (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA or SAG) labor strikes. One of their concerns involves the scanning of background actors&#39; faces for use of AI in the case of SAG, and the scraping of a screenwriter&#39;s work to generate a script that might maybe be barely equal to the human&#39;s work but for a few seconds to a few minutes&#39; worth of time as opposed to months or potentially years it would take that same screenwriter to write the script themselves but have an assurance of quality that wouldn&#39;t be there with the generated script. And in both cases, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) has declined to give a counter-offer for what the guilds are demanding because they want the money and they want the assurance that any AI-generated content can&#39;t be stolen or disputed by anyone.<br/><br/>TL;DR: If AI-generated content were to be copyrightable, it would make it that much more difficult for content creators anywhere to be able to properly fight for a place in the market, whether it be online for musical, visual, or artistic creators, or in the real world for creators such as those in WGA and SAG-AFTRA, because big corporations would just use AI to generate content faster than a human could make that same content just to squeeze out those extra few dollars from audiences on account of their being more content for the audiences to consume (and on an individual level, people could just bypass commissioning artists for their work and instead go to an AI program to, from their perspective, save time and money).
