If copyright is to protect the individual creative, it must truly do that. If piracy is theft, so too is using works under copyright to train an AI without the owner&#39;s permission. Any work created with the AI would be a derivative of all original pieces used in the training, as it could not exist without them, which violates copyright protection, and means that any AI work is copied, meaning it, itself, cannot fall under copyright.<br/><br/>Allowing AI training on works under copyright would weaken copyright as a whole, and to allow AI created works to fall under copyright would go against the basic idea of what copyright is.
