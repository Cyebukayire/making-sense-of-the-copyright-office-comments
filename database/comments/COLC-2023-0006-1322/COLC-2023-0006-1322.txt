AI should be subject to copyright infringement if it&rsquo;s trained on any work without permission. This should include companies using clients and users who don&rsquo;t want to be used to train AI. Additionally, AI generated works that steal an author&rsquo;s name and pass off the work as something written by a person who did not give permission should be considered copyright infringement and plagiarism. If humans can not take work without permission and acknowledgment of original author/ artist, AI should at minimum be held to the same standards, if not higher standards. Much art has already been fed into AI and this should be retroactive in its ruling as well since it&rsquo;s already been fed art without credit. The government will need to employ people who are versatile in AI to be able to make decisions and sense of what AI has taken from human creation. Since AI is also able to create at a faster speed, there should be regulations that prevent competition when humans are willing and able to do the work AI can do.
