I am a firm believer that people should not have to worry about a machine replacing them. This applies to all industries, whether film, fast-food or the mail industry. This act needs to pass , especially since CEO&rsquo;s have threatened to replace people with AI algorithms. Hopefully, this will also end the strike in the film industry, so that creators and actors can do the job they love while providing billions around the world stories that touch their hearts and give them comfort in this troubled world.
