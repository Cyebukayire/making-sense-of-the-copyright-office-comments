Without an artist&rsquo;s (be that visual, written, or otherwise) express consent, using their work to train AI is art theft in its most heinous sense. It steals skills and styles that artists have taken years to hone and then churns out &lsquo;content&rsquo; at a rate faster and cheaper than any artist could hope to match, making them obsolete. <br/><br/>AI is in need of some serious regulating before it should be used in any commercial sense to ensure the safety and proper compensation of the artists used to train them, and to prevent the abuse of AI in passing off work as genuine intellectually made art.
