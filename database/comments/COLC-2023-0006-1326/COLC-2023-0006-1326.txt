The use of AI to &ldquo;create&rdquo; art is a scam that directly uses the work of other artists, or the likeness and voice of actors and performers without their consent or consideration to the rights of those that produce art. Stable diffusion and other Artificial Intelligence processes take from existing works and amalgamate them into an image or work that produces nothing new based off a prompt. This is dangerous and infringes upon the rights of those that create and produce sucks works that would ordinarily be protected by copyright law.
