AI is built off of datasets created from the work of humans who need to make a living without their permission OR credit. It is not creating, it is a machine that has been trained to place pixels a certain way based on what human work it&#39;s been trained on. AI is even being used to publish art and books in the name of living and dead artists and authors without their consent or them having ANY hand in said creations. It is creating misinformation and stealing at the same time, and could lead to dangerous situations. People using ai didn&#39;t create something, they simply typed commands to a computer in hopes it&#39;s stolen data will churn out something passable hodge podged together. It&#39;s stolen and not creating something new, just chopping off pieces of other people&#39;s lives and work
