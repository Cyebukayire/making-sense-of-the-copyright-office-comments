I am a comic book illustrator who has spent ten years working to get a job with Marvel, DC, or another large publisher. I was very close until recently, when it became clear to me that due to Marvel and DC&#39;s way of treating artists, that they do in fact intend to implement AI into their workflow to produce books faster. I believe each of these large companies will simply put any art they already own into an engine, and thus they&#39;ll need illustrators far less. It has dissuaded me from working in mainstream comics now. I&#39;ve since turned away to sell my own comics as an independent artist.<br/><br/>It discourages me to have to deal with this. I feel AI is an inevitability, but corporate abuse of it is going to be so rampant that it will displace countless people. I feel Marvel&#39;s recent use of AI in &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; opening credits is only a taste of what we have to see in the future. I&#39;ve also see a major webcomics distributor, Webtoons, utilize AI comic filters that emulate the style of small-time artists. My industry is doomed.
