Contrary to what the tech industry insists, ChatGPT, Midjourney and other softwares labelled as &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is little more than a remix machine based on data sets consisting entirely of intellectual property stolen from people who have neither been informed of, credited or compensated fairly for their role in training these supposed AI softwares. Therefore, I believe any form of AI-assisted art (visual, literary or auditory) does not deserve any form of acknowledgement as intellectual property. I believe calling any AI user an artist simply because they are capable of wording AI prompts, would be like calling a McDonald&#39;s customer a chef for being able to customise their Big Mac order.
