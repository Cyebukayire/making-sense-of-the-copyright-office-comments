The new AI training models like Adobes firefly will be based on their own curated Adobe stock image page, this is to step around the current ethic problems with the other models.<br/>The stock page is already (perhaps purposely) flooded with AI works recently, including the names of artist that are against their work and likeness being used. This already makes their model just as unethical as the previous ones, just with an extra step in between.<br/>A better way would be to disallow the distribution of any model with AI or copyrighted work in its base, as the source cannot be controlled otherwise. <br/>An AI model maker should file for a form of license in which they have to provide all their copyrighted images used in the creation, up front, so illegal work cannot be used for it. <br/>Example Adobe above - using illegally sold AI work for which they are not able to get copyright for, to create a new model can be avoided this way.
