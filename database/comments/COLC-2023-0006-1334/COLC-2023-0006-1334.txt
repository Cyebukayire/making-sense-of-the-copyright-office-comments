Hello, I am a writer of transformative works as well as an artist from California and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods of not only me but also my fellow writers and artists. This technology has already done damage due to a lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
