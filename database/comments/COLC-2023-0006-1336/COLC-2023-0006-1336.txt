AI Art Infringes on people&#39;s copyrights-- often scraping copyrighted work, or the model is being trained on work that belongs to other people. You can even see remnants of the original work in the AI &#39;generated&#39; art, such as watermarks or signatures. It&#39;s theft of material made by other people, and shouldn&#39;t be able to be copyrighted.
