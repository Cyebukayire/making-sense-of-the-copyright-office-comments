I am concerned with unregulated A.I. because of threats to copyright and people&#39;s livelihoods. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little-to-no recourse. Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
