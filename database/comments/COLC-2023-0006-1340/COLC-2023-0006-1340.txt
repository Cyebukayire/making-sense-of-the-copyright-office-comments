I am a professional podcaster and I am terrified of AI taking the thousands or hours of my voice that are on the internet and using them for their own benefit without compensating me at all. I also worry about that sort of technology falling into the wrong hands and using my publicly available audio to craft a tool that is used for scamming. Please regulate AI. I&rsquo;m scared.
