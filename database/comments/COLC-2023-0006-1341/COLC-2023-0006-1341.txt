Nothing generated by AI should be able to be copyrighted, regardless of human involvement. Most AI generated work has very little human involvement. A human types in a series of prompts, and the AI generates something based on those prompts. That is not something that should be copyrightable. If I type some search terms into Google, neither I, nor Google, would be able to copyright the search results page. Works generated by AI are the same principle, and shouldn&#39;t be given any protection. Even when there is more human involvement, AI generated work still comes from a place of theft. AI is trained off of other people&#39;s work. Art AI is trained off digital artists, music AI is trained off musicians, vocal AI is trained off actors/celebrities/voice actors/etc., text AI is trained off everything on the Internet. No permission is requested or given for this, making it theft. Something created through these means should not be given any kind of copyright protection, or any kind of protection for that matter. In actuality, use of these programs should be considered akin to physical theft, and should be illegal.
