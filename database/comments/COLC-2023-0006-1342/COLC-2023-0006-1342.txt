I am an artist, 17 years old. For my whole life, I have aspired to create art professionally. But now, I become more and more aware of the issues surrounding AI, and while it is an incredible feat of technology, the way it is being used concerns and frustrates me. AI art in particular is created from millions of artworks shamelessly scraped from the internet without the artist&#39;s consent or even knowledge. As the technology gets better and better, I worry for my future as an artist and the future of the art industry as a whole. AI art is soulless and unnatural. The reason why I create art is not just for the sake of a finished product, but in the act of creating art itself. I create art because I am human. I find joy in the process and experiencing the world from the perspective of an artist. No machine nor algorithm should ever be given the ability to take that away from me. I worry that the meaning of what it means to be an artist will become forgotten and obsolete. AI art only exists because of human artist&#39;s effort in the first place. Not only is it unethical in the way it is sourced, but also the way it is used. There are many cases of AI art being used to create illegal pieces such as sexual or suggestive depictions of minors. This is a huge concern because an AI artwork is easily generated within minutes, allowing for mass distribution across the internet. Nevertheless, please consider my words. I refuse to have my future determined by an algorithm built by thieves.
