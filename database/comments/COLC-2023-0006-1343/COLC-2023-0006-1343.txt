Current copyright precedent cannot cover so-called &quot;AI,&quot; it is a technological tool unimagined at the time of most major copyright legislation. What should be of primary consideration is what is right: individual artists should have the protected right to decide whether or not to allow their works to be fed into AI algorithms. It does not matter whether we consider AI &quot;art&quot; to be of human authorship - it is a consumptive process by for-profit corporations who use copyrighted material without artist or author consent. If these corporations would like to include an oeuvre that is not in the public domain, they should use the normal avenues of obtaining usage rights - permission and payment. An artist or author posting a work on the internet is not in any way, shape, or form, them giving consent to anyone who can view the page to use that work (particularly it is NOT consent to use their work for another&#39;s profits) unless they have posted the work as CC0, no rights reserved. Respect for the primary artists and authors, without whose work the AI generations could not exist, is paramount. Protection of the individual and the craft should be established, strongly, now in order to avoid the inevitable tangle of harm that would result from ruling that AI as it currently operates is not in violation of copyright.
