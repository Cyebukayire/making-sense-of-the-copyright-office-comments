Greetings,<br/>If a computer takes in a set of inputs that are owned by other people, and use those inputs to craft a new, novel output, is that output anything more than just an algorithm applied to a dataset?  You have ruled previously that algorithms (and simpler versions, such as recipes) are not copyrightable.  Given AI outputs are some algorithm applied to a set of inputs, how can the AI (or AI owners, sponsors, or executors) have a copyright?  Unless all inputs are previously copyrighted by said owner/sponsor/executor, how do you decide how much of the ownership should belong to the true owners of those inputs?  If Disney wants to feed an AI the scripts to all of their cartoon features, as well as their Marvel Universe features, then they should be able to copyright that output, as they own all inputs that went into the algorithm.  Including anything external to that taints the dataset.  Just as we do not allow the prosecution to allow evidence that was obtained illegally, we cannot allow uncopyrightable algorithms to copyright products that are comprised of inputs they do not own.<br/><br/>Furthermore, companies that produce and do not release media should be denied copyright.  If they purchased, and therefore control rights to a property, but refuse to release their productions to the public, then why should they retain copyright and ownership?  How does that serve the public good?  This does not &quot;promote the progress of science and the useful arts,&quot; they can continue this block for an unlimited time, and therefore this seems to obviously contradict the constitution.<br/><br/>Thank you, I hope you mark me in opposition to the idea of copyright for AI.
