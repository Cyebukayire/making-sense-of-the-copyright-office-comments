I feel that work created with A.I. should not be copyrightable. It seems amoral and wrong to use this technology to essentially steal the works of other people, especially if they did not or cannot consent to their data and work being used in such a way. This also seems easily exploitative to any workers, with a company deciding that they own the rights to your likeness, voice, and talents to avoid paying the actual human worker what they are owed. I feel there need to be safeguards in place so as to prevent the actual workers, with talent and skills from being phased out but a machine that just stole from them. Not to mention, anecdotally speaking, I personally have seen people use A.I. trained on works of artists and voice talent who have passed away, something that seems wrong to do as the person in question is no longer alive to give their consent.
