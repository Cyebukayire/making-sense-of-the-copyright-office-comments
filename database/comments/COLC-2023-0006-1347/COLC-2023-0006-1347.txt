The vast majority of people wish for AI to be used as tools to help jobs, and the possibility that AI could be used to do the work most people do with only a little human maintenance, that humanity can maybe one day spend their time pursuing life&#39;s passions and hobbies is a dream many wish to come true.<br/><br/>All works used in AI should only be ones whose creators have opted in for it to be used in AI with full knowledge and consent. Having the option to opt out, meaning that it can used for AI by default, is conniving and underhanded as not everyone will be aware that&#39;s the default, and when creating and posting original pieces online for others to enjoy that hasn&#39;t been generated by AI, the possibility to be used for AI automatically is telling us the potential for money to be made and/or for others to satisfy their own needs without caring for the expense of others is more important than basic autonomy that we all deserve. This would be stripping people of our rights even further and telling us that all that matters is money.<br/><br/>All uses of AI, both commercial use and the average adult, should use only copyrighted works with full consent given.<br/><br/>We don&#39;t want to be doing all the work while others steal our works to generate an amalgamation from stolen works. The responsibility of the government, the very reason it exists, is to serve the greater good of the common people. Failure to regulate AI to being just a tool, to not require any works being used to be copyrighted and permission needed is an insult to creators, to humanity in general, telling us, &quot;Your works are worthless, everything is for the companies, the government, the billionaires, not for you. If it can turn a profit, it doesn&#39;t belong to you.&quot;<br/><br/>All AI generated works should be labelled clearly as such. Art is something deeply connected to humanity, we have the right to know when it&#39;s a mockery.<br/><br/>Our voices are ours &amp; is also something that should be protected just as much as it can be stolen and manipulated just as easily.<br/><br/>-From, a LGBT+ (queer) creator in SC, USA
