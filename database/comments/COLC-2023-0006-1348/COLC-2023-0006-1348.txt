Hello, I&#39;m going to make my point clear right now. I don&#39;t believe AI-generated content has any place being copyrighted. This is for several reasons.<br/><br/>Currently, AI is just an algorithm that predicts the most likely outcome. It&#39;s not even equivalent to someone trying to make the most generic piece of media possible. It can&#39;t create something novel, it&#39;s just cobbling together pieces of existing works and finding common threads. Even if one ignores how generic the output is, it frequently gets things wrong. AI art can&#39;t construct real, original images. Most can be easily spotted just through poor color choice, poor anatomy, or blurring where the algorithm didn&#39;t have enough data to predict what should go in that area. Written works read like an ad-lib. Some words are replaced but it&#39;s got such a standard structure that it can normally be spotted quickly.<br/><br/>While these may not be enough to argue that copyright shouldn&#39;t be given; I feel that how the algorithm &quot;learns&quot; should be brought up. The simple fact of the matter is that the vast majority of training data comes from work that falls under copyright. Many are fed works to copy an author or artist&#39;s style. While this does dodge some issues with owning the output, it is still ultimately made with others&#39; intellectual property. <br/><br/>Should these issues be dealt with by attaining rights or using self-generated works, the issue is that the true creator is a machine. Not a human or even a true analog to human intellect and creativity. It boils down to a machine rearranging data based on what&#39;s most mathematically likely given the data it has. Copyright is meant to apply to humans and allow someone to profit off of their creative efforts without it being stolen. Even if the copyright would belong to a human who owned the machine, did they really make it? <br/><br/>I&#39;m only a hobbyist at the moment, but I do worry what effect allowing such a questionable process could have on humans. After all, what about the data used to train the system that produces a copyrighted work? If the dataset includes copyrighted pieces, what happens then? I hope this is all brought into consideration when the office makes a decision on the matter.
