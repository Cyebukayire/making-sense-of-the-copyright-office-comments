While I believe that ai can help society as a whole, it should not be used to replace artists. Ai art generation pulls from a human artist&rsquo;s portfolio and completely distills their years and years of work into an overproduced amalgamation. The artists should get a say in whether or not they want their work included into something like ai generation. It&rsquo;s the same for writers as well. Authors have fake books added to their websites, like GoodReads, when in reality they were &ldquo;created&rdquo; by scammers trying to make a quick buck off an author&rsquo;s name. Ai generation is especially hurting those in the entertainment industry. Voice actors are being replaced by stilted, lifeless voice clips; teams of trained artists are being layer off for choppy &ldquo;animated&rdquo; intros for popular shows, script writers are being replaced for word documents filled with buzz words with no thought put into at all. There is no substance to ai generated art, and the money and fame of these creations are going to the wrong people. It&rsquo;s going to companies and ceos that do not have their employees interests at heart. Ceos who believe it is a &ldquo;necessary evil&rdquo; to starve out the current SAG strike, for these protesters to lose their homes.
