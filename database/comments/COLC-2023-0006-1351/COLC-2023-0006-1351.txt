To begin with, there is no intelligence in these programs.  They are just elaborate mechanisms for sorting through data, looking for patterns, and remixing them under the control of the end user.  They are just a new, elaborate example of an existing type of tool--no more intelligent than a coin sorting and wrapping machine.<br/><br/>It can seem like it&#39;s communicating with you.  But you can&#39;t get counseling from an automated puppet, no matter how well it can mimic human speech.  It does not think, it does not feel.  It cannot intuit that it is about to say something that will cause harm, and stop itself from doing so.  It doesn&#39;t know what harm is.  It&#39;s just a thing.<br/><br/>It can seem like it&#39;s teaching you.  But if it is used to make a cookbook it can&#39;t understand that it produced thirty usable recipes, forty with missing information, and fifty that simply do not work.  It cannot understand anything.<br/><br/>It can seem like it&#39;s informing you.  But if it is used to make a wild foods guide, it has no way of knowing whether its remixed product now advises people to gather broccoli in rainforests or fry up vomit-inducing mushrooms for breakfast.  It cannot know anything.  It just sorts and repackages whatever is fed into it.<br/><br/>So there is no question of &quot;training&quot; &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; on copyrighted material.  That is not what is happening at all.  The end users of this software are just using a program to mix digitized material together.  To digitize something is to turn it into a pattern that a program can respond to as it is programmed to do.  In this case, it responds to digitized input by throwing similar patterns together and displaying the result.  <br/><br/>As a toy, this might be fun.  What happens if I tell the program to write a sports article in the style of Edgar Allan Poe?  What happens if I put in the digitized contents of some mixology books that have passed out of copyright and then tell it to write a cocktail recipe?  What happens if I tell it to produce a portrait by blending a picture of me and a picture of my cat?<br/><br/>But the people who want to make money off of these programs don&#39;t want that.  They want to use copyrighted material because they want to harvest the work of people who counseled clients in crisis for 25 years, tested recipes for 14 cookbooks, got decades of experience with harvesting wild foods under the guidance of generations of elders, and were able to create books to pass on their expertise.  They want this copyrighted material because they can remix it into text that seems plausible enough to fool somebody into buying it.  And they want to do this at large volumes and at high speed, so they can get lots and lots of money by turning knowledge into nonsense.<br/><br/>Don&#39;t let them do this.  Who could it hurt, to turn so-called artificial intelligence loose in our information stream?  Everyone.
