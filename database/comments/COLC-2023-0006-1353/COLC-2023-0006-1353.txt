AI is really annoying. It gets in the way of actual artists and writer&#39;s work. It does not help the way companies think it does. It makes it harder to find references, it steals other peoples&#39; works, and it gives incorrect data that commonly caters to white people.<br/><br/>Copyright itself is already dystopian. Just look at Youtube, look at Twitch. Try to do ANYTHING related to music and you WILL be slapped in the face with strikes and get your content lost and deleted. Even huge companies commonly get their OWN streams muted for playing &#39;copyrighted&#39; music.<br/><br/>AI is only going to make this worse. More and more media, art and writing and movies included, are going to fall into this horrible line where AI steals from them and we, the ACTUAL creators, are going to get punished for trying to create ACTUAL art, music, movies.<br/><br/>Nobody but big rich corporations actually likes AI or Copyright junk. Get rid of it. Thanks :)
