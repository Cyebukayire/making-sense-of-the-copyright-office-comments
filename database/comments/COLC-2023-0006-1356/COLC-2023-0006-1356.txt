I&#39;m an artist and personally I believe AI , or ML (machine learning) needs to be regulated. The constant theft of artworks, either visual or written word, is unethical. Considering the pieces produced via AI / ML are amalgamations of preexisting pieces that are being used without permission, I do think it shouldn&#39;t be able to qualify for copyright. I think using copyrighted pieces within data sets should entirely disqualify any prompt outcome from being eligible to be copyrighted. I think using copyrighted pieces within data sets without permission should be copyright infringement.
