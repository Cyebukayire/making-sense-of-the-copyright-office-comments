Please end Ai&rsquo;s ability to use human likeness, creations, voice and ability to create. This can and will put an end to millions of creators jobs and livelihoods. The way Ai is being used is to create fraudulent content for profit by non consenting humans. The most egregious example is creating Ai porn of children and others who did not consent to their likeness being used. Ai voices are being used to manipulate truths and scam people out of money by the ability to sound like a loved one asking for money. Artists who work years to create a style are loosing jobs and money over a quick click that makes bad copies of their work for little to no cost. This is not the America we want or deserve. Please stand with so many who have fallen victim to the scam of Ai in the creative arts.
