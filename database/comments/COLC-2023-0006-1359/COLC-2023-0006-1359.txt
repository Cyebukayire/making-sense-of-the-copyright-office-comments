I love movies, and have dinner since I was a child some 40 years ago. They tell a story, and transport you to another place in the process. That magic happens because of people. People who tell you a story, in a way they know will invoke emotions in you. That&#39;s part of being human and no matter how complex the machine, it cannot be replaced.<br/><br/>Taking anything away from humans involved in script writing, acting, producing, engineering sound, light, and the other myriad of roles in the film industry would only lead to its decline, and deliver sub standard movies that people shy away from in their thousands.<br/><br/>This industry, like many others in similar positions, needs protection from interference by AI etc.
