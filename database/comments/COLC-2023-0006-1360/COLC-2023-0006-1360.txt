Hello, <br/><br/>I&#39;m thankful for the opportunity to comment. I believe that AI is a unique exploration of our culture, but that its product should be free use and copyright free.<br/><br/>I take this position because AI has been trained on the works of true creators, work that has been stolen regardless of copyright or use permission, and therefore individuals and corporations should be unable to profit from it. Since all AI production is fictive, it fits more closely in the category of transformative work similar to fanfiction (which individuals cannot profit off of).<br/><br/>Additionally, AI should have closer regulation, particularly in regards to other individuals&#39; rights to their likeness and speech. Corporations should not be able to purchase rights to use people&#39;s identities in perpetuity through AI generative works. Rather, rights should be time bound and extremely limited, to singular products, to ensure fair licencing. <br/><br/>AI is already being used to raise profits and lower creative opportunities and soon these types of careers will be threatened significantly. In order to ensure that when robots take our jobs, we need to ensure that equitable payment for our original valued work must be compensated and protected.
