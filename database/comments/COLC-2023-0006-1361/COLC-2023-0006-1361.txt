Hello. I wish to keep my identity anonymous but I am a citizen who takes issue with A.I. My main worries surrounding A.I is the growing advancement of technology gaining more control of the art field. It has become concerning that A.I has become skilled enough to replicate artworks and create its own pieces without any credit, payment, and permission given to the original artist&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s artwork was used to create these A.I artwork. A.I should not be allowed to use an artist&rsquo;s work without their explicit permission. I believe that it is important and imperative that the U.S Regulations take pre-action on this matter before it is too late. Without copyright laws being put in place, many citizen&rsquo;s careers &amp; livelihoods could be in jeopardy of the advancement of unregulated A.I. the usage of A.I artwork has already become an extreme &amp; popular issue within many art communities. The easy access &amp; free usage of A.I actively discourages many people from commissioning actual people for art which has caused a lot of financial damage to artists who are already struggling surrounding finance. With copyright laws being put in place, it&rsquo;ll help protect artists from having their artwork being used without their consent along with possibly profiting from the usage of their artwork depending on how they use the A.I artwork product. The lack of copyright protection &amp; regulations has become one of my biggest concerns this year as I feel that it will threaten my future, career, &amp; livelihood as an artist and I implore &amp; hope that the U.S regulation focuses on this topic and finds a proper way to regulate this issue and protect artists.
