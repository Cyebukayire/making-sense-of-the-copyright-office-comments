With AI rising in popularity, it&#39;s important to exercise extreme caution in regards to this new technology. The fundamental way it works involves taking others&#39; work, frequently without their permission or knowledge, and training software to notice patterns between them. <br/><br/>For example, if you train a generative AI on 10,000 pictures of bananas and tell it to generate a picture of a banana, it will be able to do so because it was able to learn what pixel arrangements resemble a banana to a human. You can take this principle and apply it to pictures of anything or anyone, such as the President. This can have profound consequences including but not limited to harassment and easing the spread of disinformation. Pictures of Donald Trump supposedly getting arrested by the police in the street have already spread online, but this event has never happened as of August 30th, 2023. These pictures were generated by AI software, but the average person probably wouldn&#39;t be able to tell the difference between a fake image created by an AI and a real image taken with a camera. There are slight errors in some AI generated photos, but it has been getting better at replicating reality as time has gone on.<br/><br/>AI software is also capable of generating images of copyrighted intellectual property, such as famous characters. You can instruct various AI services to generate a picture of Mickey Mouse and some training data sets have the information necessary to create these images. I can say with almost absolute certainty that Disney did not give anyone permission to use their intellectual property to use for training these data sets as they are extremely protective of what they own and don&#39;t just give out licenses to use it.<br/><br/>This technology has massive implications for the ability of creatives to make a living off of their hard work. It seems to be standard practice that if you don&#39;t want your content to be used for training these AIs, you must manually opt out rather than opt in. This means people who are unaware of these policies will have their content used without their knowledge or permission and without compensation. It also raises an issue with ownership of these creations, which is a controversial topic. The Copyright Office&#39;s policy of AI generated works not meeting the human creation requirement and therefore not being copyrightable is a move in the right direction, but more needs to be done to protect human creators. <br/><br/>AI training must be restricted to only content that is either public domain or licensed from the copyright holder. People who have had their data used without permission must be compensated for the money made off of the algorithm that their work contributed to.
