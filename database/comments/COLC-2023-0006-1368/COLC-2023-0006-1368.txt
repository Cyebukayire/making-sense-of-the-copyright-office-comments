Works created with these generative &ldquo;AI&rdquo; algorithms were built off of stolen work. Videos, images, music, etc. Some with their own copywrights. Businesses are already using this software to hurt working artists and steal. I wager that all work made with generative AI should be open domain or not able to be copywritten without getting explicit permission or a share from each and every source used to create the AI work. And not from some company that owns the AI. I mean from every artist, musician, production house, editor, film studio, model, photographer who&rsquo;s work was stolen to build these systems.
