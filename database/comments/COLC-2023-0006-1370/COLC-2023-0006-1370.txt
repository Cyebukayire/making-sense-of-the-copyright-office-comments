I am a creative in the field of copy writing, copy editing, and content creation. As much of my professional work includes web content writing, short and long-form articles and more, I am concerned about AI and the effect it already has on the professional world for copy and creative writing, and how this impedes promising new writers in the field. Unregulated AI scrapes content from many professionals and their work without their consent to train their models. The result is an output of content that is incorrect and poorly framed, while putting the livelihoods of many writers at risk. Many companies are already seeking to replace existing writers for content with no regard to their authenticity. Unregulated AI puts forth books, articles and more that is lifted from other writers and sold for profit, without any consent. <br/><br/>For my own professional career, I have been able to craft copy and more, but with AI, my livelihood is put at risk as employers are seeking to cut out workers and avoid giving compensation to them by relying on generative content. Creatives deserve to freely practice their craft and offer their work without having it scraped by AI just for the sake of profit for companies.<br/><br/>With regulations, we can ensure this technology is used responsibly and without threatening careers. We would protect creatives and not hinder technological innovation. It is the power of creatives that have given us beautiful stories and powerful informative essays and articles. Unregulated AI can put all of that at risk, for we should always seek out true authentic work in this time of rampant misinformation.
