I believe, for the protection of the arts, that AI created works should not be copyrighted. To do so robs artists and writers of opportunities. I have had friends have their writing gigs dry up as periodicals switch to AI written articles. Copyright was created to give security to creatives. To allow AI generated material to be copyrighted undermines the Arts.
