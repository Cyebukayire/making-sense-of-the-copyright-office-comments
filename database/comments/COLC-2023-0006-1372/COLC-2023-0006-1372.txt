Although I am not an American citizen I recognise the influence the American Copyright system has on other countires law making, as well as our increasingly interconnected world through online spaces often tines people find themselves fighting legal battles in international systems. AI generated images, sound, music, text, and voices should not be copyrightable as it is not only not made by humans but also exclusively made from other people&#39;s copyrighted material. For example an AI based voice synthesiser will use Creative Commons BY-NC-SA recordings to make a voice bot, they will then attempt to charge for the use of that bot even though the original recording is CC BY-NC-SA. This goes for many other forms of media. <br/>AI programs trained on copyrighted material is theft as it is transformation of copyrighted work without the permission of the original creator.
