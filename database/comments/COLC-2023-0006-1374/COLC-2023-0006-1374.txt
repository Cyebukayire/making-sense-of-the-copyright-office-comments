As an artist this issue is very important to me. The simple fact here is that AI could not create an image without using stolen, copyrighted material. The intentions infringe not only upon our work, but on the whole livelihood of the industry. Companies want to replace us by stealing our work. <br/>The only human who contributed to AI generated content are the humans whos work was stolen, and fed to a machine which is told to do the same thing but faster. <br/>In the case of celebrity likenesses its easy to see how AI can lead to defamatory infringements. <br/>If copyright is intended to protect human creators from having their work stolen and profited from, its needed here now to protect artists across many mediums from having their lifetimes worth of work  stolen to create a version of you thats stagnant in innovation but can out produce you. And Companies do not want good work, they want fast work. They should not be allowed to destroy the sanctity of human artistry by allowing a machine that knows only how to copy to create copyrighted art by stealing the work of everyone else. <br/>Please do not put the future art in the cold hands of an algorithm.
