According to the US Copyright office: &quot;Copyright is a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression.&quot; That said, what we call artificial Intelligence systems are software that can only combine existing original works of authorship that are input into them. Everything remixed by these software systems references a database of existing works that already have copyright. Unlike humans, software cannot put a personal touch on the works it builds from a database, it can only literally copy and plagiarize in a complex way that has the illusion of originality. If copyright is meant to protect original works of authorship written by human authors, then a copyright would naturally protect authors from being exploited by plagiarism software.
