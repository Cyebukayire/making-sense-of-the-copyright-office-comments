AI creations should not be considered for copyright. These are the result of scraping the work of talented artists and writers, who have not consented to have their work used in this way. This removes any protection that copyrights can offer legitimate creators. Machines should be tasked with menial drudge work, notthe creation of the arts. One cannot expect an algorithm to feel, or understand, or comment on the state of humanity; all the provenance of the arts.
