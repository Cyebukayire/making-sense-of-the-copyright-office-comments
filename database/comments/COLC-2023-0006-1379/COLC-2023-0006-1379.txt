I am an American citizen currently living in Italy. AI image and text generation is nothing more or less than automated plagiarism, because all the data it&#39;s &quot;trained&quot; on comes from human artists and writers. It&#39;s not possible for a computer to generate or synthesize its own ideas; all it has is a statistical summary of what all its sources have done. It doesn&#39;t even have any mechanism for integrating new ideas from the user, only for searching its stolen sources for the user&#39;s keywords. It is definitionally incapable of doing anything OTHER than regurgitating real artists&#39; work -- and the artists were neither consulted nor compensated for that work. It needs to be understood that neither the user nor the programmer is the &quot;creator&quot; of anything that comes directly from the machine -- the original artists are, and their work is being stolen.
