While I know that there are extremely beneficial uses of AI in various facets of our life, it is imperative that caution is taking when learning how to train these models, and with what they are trained with. Reproductions and parodies of work are common in our forms of artistic expression, however, it can be argued that these works all add on something from a unique brain and created personality around an irreplaceable culture. AI training off of these works, however, especially without the permission of the original artists in any capacity, removes the control one might have over a work that may represent much more than a piece that is entertaining to look at, listen, or read. Ultimately, art is not meant to be consumed as an end result (which is what AI outputs) but the process of it. Protecting artistic pieces and other copyrighted works is vital to ensure anyone who creates can protect their own intellectual property without fear of it being used without their knowledge by others.
