First, Artificial intelligence seems to do nothing but collate things made by humans. I think that treating it as either impassive (as a force for judging and deciding) or new (as a creative force) is dangerous, because we risk repackaging our own thoughts and treating them as if they came from something other than ourselves. <br/><br/>Second: Already, I see a lot of the people in this country burdened by an unwillingness to trust anything at all. No one can agree on what is fact and what is not, because we all feel an essential distrust of one another. The speed and profligacy of things made by artificial intelligence, their believability paired with their untruth, seems like a bad thing to add to that cultural landscape. <br/><br/>Third: I&#39;m an artist and a writer, but I can&#39;t feed myself by doing art or writing, and I dream of a day when I can. The idea that art, or stories, or translation, or voice work, or acting, or singing, or judging--the idea that ANY of these things could be automated seems to make them all meaningless. It certainly makes them unprofitable, which is the next worst thing when everyone needs to eat. I think that making artificial intelligence-made art impossible to copyright is an excellent first step, but I think that if America wants to continue to be a cultural center in the world, we need to ensure that art can continue to be a profitable career here--that the people who make art can continue to live by their work, and can find meaning and value in it. I hope there are legislative steps made to encourage this.
