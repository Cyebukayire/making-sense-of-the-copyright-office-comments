I agree with the copyright office&rsquo;s original decision to not allow AI generated content to have copyright protection. As not only is the content made without human hands but the database that it&rsquo;s based on uses artwork, photos and writings that were put in there without the permission of the original creators. Most of whom don&rsquo;t even know that they&rsquo;re work has been used for these databases, nor see any kind of payment or royalties from the companies who run them. In my opinion there needs to be some form of regulation against these technologies to prevent them from abusing creators and to allow creators to get payments for their work being used.
