Artificial Intelligence will quite likely have useful applications in the future -- but replacing artists isn&#39;t one of those useful applications, particularly because the entirety of the training sets used to &quot;train&quot; AI is artwork &quot;scraped&quot; without attribution from the internet. In truth, the &quot;intelligence&quot; at work is creating copies of copies of original work done by humans and mulching them into an art-like object. This is merely a vast and careless form of plagiarism of human artists that will, if allowed to participate in any part of copyrightable work, steal the real work of human artists and repurpose it for the benefit of whomever prompts the AI to create art-like works for money. It&#39;s essentially the thievery scheme from the movie &quot;Office Space&quot; -- stealing pennies from small transactions over time in an attempt to make that thievery fly in under the radar. Worse still, these pennies will be stolen from all artists each and every time an AI work is permitted to be sold. This would seem to be the very opposite of promoting the progress of useful arts and instead a vast sea of paper cut thefts that will in fact destroy the useful arts in the pursuit of short term profit for unscrupulous actors. And as a writer for television, film and the stage, these thefts will affect me personally (and the livelihood of my family) as well as the entire endeavor of creative writing and filmmaking. Again, I am sure that industrious humans will find genuinely beneficial uses for AI but allowing it to become in any way enmeshed in or intertwined with copyrightable creative work is sure to be a long term negative for all of humanity. To quote a human author from the internet: &quot;can we get some a.i. to pick plastic out of the ocean or do all the robots need to be screenwriters?&quot; Let&#39;s indeed get that plastic out of the ocean.
