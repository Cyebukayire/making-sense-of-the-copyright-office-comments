Art represents a creative effort by a person, it&rsquo;s someone taking things that existed, like nature, abstract concepts, or even someone else&rsquo;s art and adding to it. However, to take other people&rsquo;s work, put it into a shredder, and have a machine put it together with no creative vision, only algorithm and automation, is not to create art. <br/>Let&rsquo;s compare it to another case, the Monkey Selfie Copyright Dispute in which a macaque took a selfie, and some argued that it deserved to own the picture. Both a Federal District Court and an Appeals Court ruled against this, claiming that a monkey cannot own copyright under US law. The argument that the photographer David J. Slater made was that he engineered the situation, which was true. <br/>So, if a living breathing animal can&#39;t own copyright, than how can we say that an unthinking machine does?<br/>It&rsquo;s important to remember that these so called &ldquo;artificial intelligences&rdquo; are not actually intelligent, and they don&rsquo;t actually think. They may be a major step in the right direction, but they are no more sentient than a text autocomplete, or a washing machine with a timer. <br/>Perhaps the machine&rsquo;s owner claims that they own copyright, because they engineered the situation, but did they engineer anything or did they say &ldquo;machine, draw a painting for me&rdquo; and then pretended that they drew it themselves?
