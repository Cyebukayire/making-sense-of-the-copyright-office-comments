I would like to see protections in place for Americans whose jobs are threatened or currently being phased out by Artificial Intelligence. Be it truck drivers, cashiers or even writers in Hollywood, the phasing out of an entire industry without creating a new one for said people to possibly transition to only furthers the blight consuming this country. We&rsquo;re ready for a house or senate committee that specifies how we mandate Artificial Intelligence, to create the guidelines that dictate Artificial Intelligence may only be applied in a manner that improves the job experience, not replace it. We&rsquo;re more than ready for a federally backed organization to enforce those guidelines. We must not fear the future, but we must not let it run amok in service of the richest among us for the sole purpose of saving a few dollars. Said committee members must demonstrate a deep understanding of what Artificial Intelligence even is to be apart of it, as would be the heads of an Artificial Intelligence Bureau. Artificial Intelligence can help society in so many ways, like assisting the elderly in avoiding being scammed online/over the phone, or monitoring conditions in people afflicted with illness or injury, or organizing data for reference in scientific studies, the list goes on but we can only get there if we make sure AI isn&rsquo;t purely for replacing jobs and deepfaking viral online videos for the sole purpose of spreading misinformation. <br/><br/>We should get ahead of this before it gets ahead of us.
