AI work is not created by a real human and should not be able to be copyrighted. Copyrights are to protect intellectual property such as art and science and inventions. We use it to protect people&#39;s works. A machine doesn&#39;t spend hours creating and working. The reason we have copywriters is to protect something a person has put time and work into. Someone righting a prompt in an AI generator did not spend the time to make them worthy of that protection. <br/><br/>Additionally, and possibly more importantly, AI requires examples to create more. In order to make images images had to be fed to it. Work that is already under copyright had to be stolen in order for the machine to make more. For artists and writers this means something they spend hours on can be mimiced within minutes which takes away potential revenue from artists in the future. If we allow this usage to continue AI will spread. What will happen when architecture plans and machine schematics are created by AI? Will those things be safe? Could AI spread further?<br/><br/>Copyright is to protect hard work. AI generated things, machine generated things, did not require hard work and do not merit copyright protections. They broke copywrites already in existence to build their foundations.
