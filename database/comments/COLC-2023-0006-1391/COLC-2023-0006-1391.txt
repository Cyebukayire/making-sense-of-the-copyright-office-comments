Greetings.<br/><br/>As a professional artist who looked into the workings of Image gen tech, whose work was found in Laion5B (the dataset used to create the current biggest image gen AI), and on whose work &quot;LORA&quot; were trained (AI model specifically mimicking my style and branded with my pen name), I thought I could have something pertinent to add regarding the current inquiries.<br/><br/>Regarding the first issue, about whether or not one&#39;s permission should be asked to use his data for training purposes, and if/how remuneration should be awarded. <br/>AI models would be absolutely worthless without carefully curated data, the bulk of which was uploaded without their agreement on various platforms scraped by dataset bots. Machine learning models wouldn&#39;t even be able to generate a single coherent picture if it didn&#39;t use proper data, it would have no value whatsoever. As such, regardless of how it was processed, if all the value in your product is derived from other people&#39;s work and brand that they did not necessarily agreed to share, it makes sense that they should be made aware that their work is being used, and they should be asked for consent and they are deserving of compensation. The idea of &quot;opt-out&quot; is not working and never will: creatives shouldn&#39;t be required to go through the lengthy and impossible process of looking into every single AI model and go through a convoluted request for their work to be taken out of a model which may or may not result in anything (which would require the entire model to be trained again).<br/>When prompted, the holder of the AI model should show complete transparency regarding the dataset used to create their model, and allow people to look for their work in it. If it is present, it should be grounds for copyright infringement.<br/>I do not believe proper remuneration systems are even feasible at all. The sheer amount of data required for these models to even be commercially viable wouldn&#39;t make it possible for artists to be properly remunerated- and if they were, it would be pennies in favor of the huge slice of the market AI is creeping into.<br/><br/>Regarding the second issue, inquiring about to what extent AI generated material should be protected by copyright. <br/>Do not change anything, it is perfect as it is. Protection should only be afforded to works having sufficiently been altered after the prompting phase. The selection of training material and prompts still do not make it human work, the algorithm is obviously still doing nearly everything in one&#39;s stead, to such a blatant extent that it barely warrants an explanation.<br/><br/>Lastly, about the third inquiry, which asks whether or not the creator of the dataset or the user of the AI should be held liable in case of copyright infringement.<br/>The blame falls on whoever put the image in the dataset. If it is part of an unaltered model such as Midjourney or StableDiffusion, then the companies peddling them should be held liable. If the infringing data was added afterwards by a third party (to create a LORA or other model for example), but the picture cannot be found on the dataset of the developer, then the third party should be held liable instead.<br/><br/>Copyright exists to protect human creators, and human creations. It should be kept that way, to promote creativity, actual creativity, not the artificial bootlegging people mistake as such. It never needed automation, and never will.<br/>Thank you for your time.
