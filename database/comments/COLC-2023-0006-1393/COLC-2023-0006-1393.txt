AI is not a tool that should ever have been introduced to the creative fields. The best works it has &#39;produced&#39; have all been stolen pastiches of human artists&#39; and writers&#39; work, always without permission or compensation, and now frequently used to substitute or diminish the livelihoods of those same human creators. AI must not be allowed to go any further than it has without regulation and/or penalties for the clear theft involved to make its programs function. Already there have been cases of artists and authors having their pieces stolen and regurgitated through AI, either to give the users an excuse to sell the work as their own, or else to produce fraudulent works under those creators&#39; names. In truth, AI art and AI writing are no more or less than new names for plagiarism; it&#39;s simply quicker than it used to be. There must be consequences going forward that will genuinely deter the use of nonconsenting artists and writers--notably, the vast majority of all creatives--as a feeding ground for parasitic programs and users hoping to get a quick buck from others&#39; work.
