AI Art is exploitative and threatens the sanctity of human creativity. Images fed to AI image creation programs must be filled with pictures in the public domain or in which the human artist gave permission for their work to be used in this way. Any AI Art made under those guidelines *should* be eligible to be copyrighted, but even then, AI Art is a special case, as the human prompter is ultimately at the mercy of the AI program, and therefore the human prompter may be completely unaware of their infringement upon another AI-generated work.
