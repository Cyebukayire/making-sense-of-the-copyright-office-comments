As an artist, I deeply worry that I&#39;m not protected in anyway due to this A.I. craze. I fear that my art will be used without my permission to train some machine to pump out lifeless, flawed, and unimaginative art for monetary gain. I dedicate hours upon hours to my craft and I don&#39;t want to be pushed out by somebody who only see dollar signs vs. creativity
