I think there are a lot of issues when it comes to AI, particularly in relation to creation of digital artwork and creative writing. For example, current software has run into a multitude of issues where AI artworks are created for profit explicitly or implicitly by copying specific artwork styles or artists without consent and/or knowledge of the original creator.  I support regulations that would restrict AI from sourcing artists and writers freely (such as off of Google searches) without explicit permission given by an artist/business/etc. It is imperative that human creation is honored. AI can be a valuable tool for creation, but without the input of actual human creativity it can instead undermine creative expression.
