I&#39;ve been investigating a lot regarding the issues of artificial intelligence (or Large Learning Models) and although this technology can be beneficial, it also raises concerns on the art community and how their work is used without their consent. Many of us had our work used for AI models like Dall-E, ChatGPT, Midjourney and some others oftentimes to replicate the art or writing style from a selected artist, thus, diluting their brand and reducing drastically traffic for their work. Many artists, including the ones on the entertainment industry, depend on their art to live, it&#39;s a job, and one that already doesn&#39;t pay well enough to survive, and AI might come to displace them from that industry altogether. Beyond this, voice actors and public figures had their voices cloned without their knowledge and sometimes used to spread false information about their persona, thing that AI art generators are often used for too.<br/>With the current AI training model, the question is whether the artist is the person or the machine, while AI provides the means, the algorithm itself requires very little human input, and it&#39;s collection of art also contains copyrighted material of uncompensated artists, which also puts into question if it can be considered art or plagiarism.<br/><br/>The only way I can see AI can be copyrighted is if the model itself was built ethically from the ground up with either owned training material or material provided by donations, to put an example, Adobe Firefly utilizes their own stock material as well as material provided by users with their explicit consent.
