AI is horrifically under-regulated which has allowed countless people to take advantage of other&rsquo;s copy-written material for their own financial gain. The use of AI in all contexts needs extensive regulation and those who&rsquo;ve been used without consent in its development deserve to be compensated. There is documented proof that AI&mdash;from generated art to text services&mdash;have been trained with copy-written materials against the owners wishes. This is unacceptable and should be punishable by law.
