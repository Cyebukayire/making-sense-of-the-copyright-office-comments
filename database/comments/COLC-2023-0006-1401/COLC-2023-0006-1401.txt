AI tools in their current incarnation are being used to consume materials without respect to licensing or other concerns and regurgitate them without consideration. It&#39;s likely that a large percent of the surface internet has already been poisoned by this activity.<br/><br/>Search engines seem extraordinary vulnerable to generated content, making finding information more difficult now that ai generated &quot;resources&quot; are being promoted.<br/><br/>In addition, humans seem to attribute intent and good faith to grammatically correct statements which generative text tools are capable of providing. Unfortunately, these text tools do not currently have (and arguably may never have) ways to ensure that the statement-like content they generate is truthful or based in any reality.
