Ai is a tool land it should be used like any other. It&#39;s no different to the electric synth!<br/><br/>Those wanting to limit is use are just being protectionist Luddites.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t think it matters who comes up with something, if a company that owns the Ai, produces something with Ai, it should have a copyright!<br/><br/>
