Allowing the unauthorized use of images &amp; other content to inform the development of AI is part &amp; parcel of the erosion of human agency &amp; represents a form of indentured servitude for those contributing to a future beyond their control.

At best, it&rsquo;s a mocking counterfeit of human effort. At worst it&rsquo;s an effort to monopolize art and media.
