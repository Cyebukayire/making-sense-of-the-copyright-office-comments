AI is taking people&#39;s content without their permission. It is theft. It isn&#39;t intelligent, it isn&#39;t creating anything of its own, it is taking people&#39;s writing and cutting it up and not giving credit. If we allow this to continue like it is, it is going to take more and more jobs away from many different people. They are replacing artists, writers, advertisers, actors, translators, all using content created by these people cut up and not checked afterwards. There are horror stories about translations being done poorly by AI. These things are done cheaply by companies at the expense of the quality of the product. We don&#39;t want poor quality works that steal people&#39;s content and tarnish the act of creation. Companies cannot get the right to copyright the products of AI, not when they farm websites made of other people&#39;s work that is often owned by them by copyright. Something personal to me is the fact that fanfiction sites are used to farm AI content. This should be a major issue, specifically if they are attempted to copyright that work, considering the amount of issues involved between copyright and fanfiction to begin with. The writers on these sites legally cannot make money from the hours of work that goes into writing their stories because doing so violates the copyright fair use policy. AI should be no different, it should not be allowed to make money by farming these stories no matter how much they are torn apart, because that copyright is owned by other writers and companies who the AI companies have not gotten permission from to generation their answers. That doesn&#39;t even go into the fact that it&#39;s morally wrong to be taking content from small artists and writers online who cannot defend themselves and their creations from being stolen by city companies with way more money than they&#39;ll ever have in their life. The government needs to stand up for its citizens and preventing the continued growth of AI is a part of that.
