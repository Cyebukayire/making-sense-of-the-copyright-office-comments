AI works as they stand now are completely uncopyrightable in my eyes. <br/>Every model I&#39;ve seen used was trained on material taken without owner/creator permission. Generative AI then takes a prompt, often a sentence at the longest, effectively cuts and pastes chunks of its training data together without further human input, and presents it as something &quot;new.&quot; <br/>The prompt is shorter than any explanation I&#39;ve ever sent to an actual artist for a commission, and that output would still not be *my* art unless it was specifically part of the artist&#39;s terms. If I cannot copyright a piece of art I paid for, with more description of desired outcome, without the artist agreeing to release the piece to me, in what way is it remotely fair for the person giving the generative AI to be able to do so? They give a vague description of their goal, which is then automatically slapped together using art that was not willingly provided by its creator. To add insult to injury, many AI prompts include details such as &quot;in the style of (artist).&quot; This means the AI will simply focus on using training data from that artist, making results that duplicate their style and effectively creating a forged art piece.
