1) Machine learning is not copyright infringement, because artificial neural networks and human neural networks use the same mathematic principals to learn.<br/><br/>2) AI generated works should be eligible for copyright, given that there are already AI models that will take a brain scan as input, to generate content that was in the brain, and using a peripheral (such as a prompt), which semantically represents the same thing the person had in mind, are no different from the authorship point of view.<br/><br/>3) Regulations must use Article 1 section 8, &quot;to advance the useful sciences&quot;, as the text as informed by history, method of being in compliance with the constitution and the first amendment.<br/><br/>4) Publicity rights have been held to be preempted by the first amendment in the 9th Circuity, and the right of copyright does not extend to the right of publicity. see e.g. Sarvier v. Chartier https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16260639428584030858#p906<br/><br/>5) AI models themselves are not copyrightable because they have no human authorship aspect at all, they are purely a set of observed facts that were not set in motion by a human author, but a statistical measurement of the observations of copyrighted code. They are also not expressive at all, there is no creativity, only observations.
