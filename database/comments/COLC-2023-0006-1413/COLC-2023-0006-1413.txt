I don&#39;t believe AI content should be applicable for copyright protection. AI content is created through the processing of online data, including original copyrighted material. Thusly being able to copyright AI generated works opens the door for a wealth of copyright infringement utilizing company&#39;s intellectual properties. A company&#39;s material can be processed without their consent, and the ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a piece of AI content was generated without the utilization of a company&#39;s intellectual property is near impossible. With these factors in mind, not allowing the ability to copyright AI generated works would uphold the legal protection of currently standing copyrights and the material associated.
