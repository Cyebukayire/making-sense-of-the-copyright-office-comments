As an artist, I&#39;m not worried about my art being stolen by an AI, because it is all analog. I did have a rare digital piece stolen once, pre-AI, without credit, so I know what it&#39;s like. I know a number of digital artists, and they are watching their passion used by someone using a search engine, and have the recognition of the hard work they put into said art denied to them. Art is hard. As a paper-and-paint artist, I could easily dismiss digital paintings, with the ability to erase, and with tools far more predictable than my chosen medium of watercolors, but I see it as art. AI-generated images, though, are not as art, but as lazy. I think back to the day when the I told the thief of my work that all they had to do was give me credit if they wanted to keep it, and they preferred instead to take it down. More than that, that, though, that professional organizations, though, from big Hollywood studios to community theaters, would rather use the free AI engines than pay someone for their work, is sickening. Please protect us, you&#39;re the only ones who can.
