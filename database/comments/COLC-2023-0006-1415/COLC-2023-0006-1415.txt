Artificial Intelligence makes use of already existing pieces of art / content to generate new content. This should be recognised as theft if this is done without acquiring the permission of the original creator. Only and only if the orginal creator grants his permission to use his work to train AI, should it be acceptable to use it. <br/>Creativity is inherently a human trait. Art is nothing without the artist. This is what gives art its meaning and appeal, its authenticity. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go to a museum to see art pieces that were artificially generated within seconds. I&rsquo;d go there to admire art and learn about the artist, what went on in his mind when he created the piece, to see the world through his eyes. Use of AI in art defeats the very purpose of art. The copyright rules should be as strict as possible, the strictest, in this case. Currently people are using AI to make songs sung in the voice of singers they like, when those singers haven&#39;t actually given their voice to those songs. This is unfair  and a theft of their unique voice and singing style. This is why AI should be heavily regulated with very strict copyright laws. Content shouldn&rsquo;t be used to reproduce new content without the permission of the original creator. <br/>These new laws and regulations will be a very  important step in guiding the world towards a new direction. What we do now will heavily impact the future of the world, creativity, AI and humanity. As the decision taken by USA will be very influential in the decision making of other countries across the world. Very cautious steps should be taken.
