I think there need to be really strict copyright laws for the AI training sets - it shouldn&#39;t be allowed to take a creator&#39;s labor and put it into AI so something &quot;like that&quot; comes back out. Especially corporations need to disclose every single piece of data in their training sets and people&#39;s art and likenesses should only be allowed in the training data with their explicit written consent. Otherwise it&#39;s a copyright infringement as far as I&#39;m concerned. I think AI copyright should be regulated a bit like fanwork: if you want to take someone else&#39;s work and build off of that, you can NOT do it for profit and if it is for profit, again, explicit written consent. We cannot and should not allow AI to take over the creation of art when, by nature of its mechanisms, it steals people&#39;s intellectual property and profits off of it. I&#39;ve read that there have been AI-written books published under a real author&#39;s name and that the book was added to that author&#39;s goodreads. Readers believed at first that this was genuinely this author&#39;s writing because the AI had been trained on the author&#39;s previously written books. This is not okay. So any piece of media that is AI created should also have to declare that it is AI created and in plain sight, too - not in the fineprint at the end but on the cover page. Please do not let AI steal people&#39;s labour, voice, likeness, name, intellectual property or anything else.
