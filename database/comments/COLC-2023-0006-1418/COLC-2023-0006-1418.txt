I think the ai, which exploits the socially disadvantaged and only doubles as a company, should be opposed. They&#39;re not only destroying the environment, they&#39;re violating contracts with people who categorize the material for ai learning, they&#39;re also using violence to provide them, and empty content that&#39;s produced without any copyright consciousness is just a blasphemy to human culture, and it&#39;s very concerning the loss of many people and misuse of personal information. Of course, I don&#39;t deny that ai can be used for beneficial things, but I hope you can create strong regulations on ai as the rights of many people are being violated now than it is used for positive things.
