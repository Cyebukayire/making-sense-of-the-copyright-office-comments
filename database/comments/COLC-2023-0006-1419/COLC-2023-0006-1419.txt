My name is Kate. Art I believe, and very sincerely so, is inherently part of the human experience, and comes from humanity,  not AI. It comes from the creativity of the artists and no algorithm can ever do that and accomplish anything close to it. AI steals and scraps with inputs and prompts, as it scours throughout the internet and so on, given to them by people looking to replace artists already struggling to live just well enough to get by in life. Their art has brought me joy and peace in my life since I was a child, and having already seen examples of what AI can *do*, they are imitations at best of the art they have copied, and nightmarish theft at worst.<br/><br/>Corporations such as Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney and Netflix, and their ardent supporters from there are fervently advocating for AI to replace writers, and actors, stealing from the latter in regard to their own likenesses,  which is gross and tantamount to identity theft to me. These CEOs do not want to pay them any longer after already not payed most of them enough to begin with, just to have another opportunity at making more profit for themselves. It&#39;s selfish, greedy and absolutely not moral to do that to people who put them there in the first place. Is that not, as many would say, part of the American experience and dream? To be valued for your contributions and work, then be recognized for it? Being discarded after all that effort and having one&#39;s own work reused and stolen to me, is very, very wrong, and downright cruel. This is what I believe. I advocate for the rights of writers to not have their written works reused, and recycled without end by the film/production studios. I also advocate for actors to not have their likenesses stolen and reused, without their permission and knowledge forever, as well, by these same corporations.
