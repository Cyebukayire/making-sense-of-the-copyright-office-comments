I am ABSOLUTELY opposed to Ai being allowed to grow and be used in an unregulated fashion. Not only is it at the moment being trained on the copy-written work of humans it is a clear and present danger to humanity as a whole as well as a functioning economy and society. I believe the government should HEAVILY regulate it. The European Union has already taken steps abs measures to begin regulating it and so should we. And we cannot expect it to or allow it to take the work of humans especially in the entertainment arts as it is not human and at the moment all it can do is approximate stories based on the work of others and is not capable of really touching the human spirit or soul. Many tests done with Ai with constraints removed have in VERY short time had to be taken offline because the Ai bot (probably due to the immense amount of vitriol that exists on the internet) became hostile and immediately threatened human life. If we have no way of controlling the Ai it poses a real exestentisl threat to humanity especially now that the world is so interconnected digitally. I BEG congress to ACT NOW.
