As someone who has been online and seen the birth of, majority of the A.I things that have come out recently, I do not think that A.I works should be allowed copyright. <br/><br/>The reason being is that, A.I works are unethical. The vast majority of works that have been made with A.I have little to no human interaction to actually make the piece. Furthermore, practically all A.I works, from ChatGPT to Midjourney have stolen works from other people for their own gain. These systems cannot learn without things being fed into them, and then they take pieces of these works to put into other works. They copy styles from individuals from well-known sources. Disney, Studio Ghibli, Picasso, no artist is safe, and it goes the same for writers too. Countless people have had their work stolen, and the people doing it could care less about that fact. Not only that but works like these have no humanity in them, there is nothing to think on, but it doesn&#39;t just stop at poor writing. They can put actual faces into these, be it anyone in the government who&#39;s had a picture taken, or to someone who&#39;s passed away like John F Kennedy or James Dean or Jimi Hendrix and use their voice, their likeness without consent which is an invasion of privacy, to which privacy is protected in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth amendments. <br/><br/>Directors wish to copy the voices of their actors, so they can use them whenever they want to make new lines with the recorded words and edit them how they wish, which then in turn cause people to lose contracts. Though then how does it stop because if they could do that, then they could copy the voices of people in power, and if they do that, they can fake what is said by those people, and cause massive trouble. The same could happen with writers, be out of jobs, but that matters not to a computer, just as you could feed it the Constitution, and fake actual legal documents. <br/><br/>People seem to miss the difference in A.I that has been built specifically for the use of being able to show lighting or movement for a model that is being done with a game or movie which are trained specifically with those models being used with only those models, and all of the A.I that is stealing works, and unfortunately the ones in question are stealing works. The people of this country, and those around the world, are not benefiting from A.I works, especially not when people have entered them into contests, then won, but then for it to all come apart when someone who&#39;s worked for months on something loses to a piece that was made in a few minutes, mostly off of other stolen works where all a person did was type a sentence into a machine.<br/><br/>A.I is also harming musicians by people putting songs through them and making covers, and the music industry already has problems with copyright, and songs people stolen. This is just another example of copyright infringement that has been coming out of A.I of recent, not only that but then they could have songs made from people where they didn&#39;t write that song and destroy the reputation of people like the late singers Whitney Houston and Amy Winehouse, for example.<br/><br/>All in all, with possible threats, infringement on people&#39;s rights, and the very clear way these have been built up illegal via theft, A.I should not be allowed copyright. It would be a different story if they had used their own works or had gotten permission from people to have their works and likeness used by these machines, but that is not the case. Art, writing, music, likeness, voices, and more have all been stolen to make these things exist. It has gotten to a point where fake pornography of young women and girls have been made with their faces and voices and uploaded to dark places on the web, where it can then be spread, they can have their address leaked and end up getting harassed by a video that isn&#39;t even real, just a stolen face on a fake body, doing acts that never happened. All of these things are having harmful effects on our society, and it&#39;s only getting bigger and climbing it&#39;s way to the top. I had even heard of someone thinking that a piece of A.I from ChatGPT was Jesus Christ or God, that they were being talked to by a higher power. Not only that but I have seen people using ChatGPT to come up with hate speech and praising acts of violence such as the Holocaust.<br/><br/>I urge you to not allow for copyright on A.I works as they are unethical and immoral in very damning ways. Stolen works and identity theft is not a joke. Some of the things people put into these are unthinkable, unfathomable. This may seem as if I&#39;m harping on such technology, but if it had been used for something better, then the story would be different. Please listen to the people and the massive concerns that will follow, and just how many people urge against the copyright for A.I. People will try to fight for it, but it&#39;s not fair for them to be allowed to steal the hard work of others to claim as their own. The radio star lives.
