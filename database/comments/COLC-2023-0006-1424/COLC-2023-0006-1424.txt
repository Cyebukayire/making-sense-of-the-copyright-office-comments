AI &quot;artwork&quot; (AI generated images), AI &quot;writing&quot; (AI generated text), and othet AI generated materials should not be considered for copyright protection. These &quot;AI&quot; are trained on materials from either unclear sources, or known sources that did not consent to their works, images, and even voices, being used for this purpose. It is exploitative of human artists, writers, actors, and creators works. AI generated works require little human input (entering of prompts not liable to be considered &quot;creating&quot; theses works) and using creations or work of real, human, creators to generate these things without their consent. As such these &quot;creations&quot; should not be afforded copyright nor protected under it so long as this continues to be the case. (Which, if the companies and individuals involved words and actions are considered, will always be the case.) Unless there is a dramatic change in the way these programs operate these works should not even be considered for copyright protection. Even if there were dramatic changes the creation of these works may still not be worthy of consideration due to the nature of the &quot;creation&quot; method used to generate them.
