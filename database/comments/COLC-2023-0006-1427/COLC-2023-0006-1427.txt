The government should impose both a non-copyrightable law when using AI(meaning AI trained on other people&#39;s copyrighted material is non-copyrightable by definition, as it is a machine learning off people&#39;s work and not an original concept), and there should be heavy regulation on AI use for audio and video of people. As there are already examples of people using AI to make deepfake porn of people without their consent, and audio files of people talking and saying things that they have never said in their life, thus making it fake.
