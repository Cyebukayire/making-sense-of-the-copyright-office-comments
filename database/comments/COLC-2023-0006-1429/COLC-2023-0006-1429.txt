AI cannot create, it can only compile. It cannot transform, it can only regurgitate. It is inherently criminal, because everything that it produces is made from preexisting material that it has been trained on. Nothing made with AI should be protected. AI that are trained on material that was not given with permission should be prohibited. Companies that allow users to post their work should not be permitted to change their terms of service retroactively to say that they&#39;re going to now use anything posted to train an AI. Proponents of AI have nothing but contempt for humanity. <br/><br/>AI should be strongly and vigorously regulated. Individual human creators should have clear priority protection. AI training must be held to a very high standard of purely opt-in with true creators being appropriately compensated. <br/><br/>If a human person did the things AI is being used for, there would be no question of the wrongness. You cannot forget that there are humans using AI, benefiting from it and hiding behind it. It is a black hole of theft and misinformation.
