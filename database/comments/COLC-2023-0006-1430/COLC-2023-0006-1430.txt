Since AI became bigger in the art sphere and industry, I have received comments from paying clients that they will no longer use my design services. Instead they will use AI instead. I can safely say I&#39;ve lost income from exploitative AI.<br/><br/>AI is already harming the livelihoods of creatives, from visual artists to writers. It is not unusual to use some AI tools in some aspects of art, such as VFX and 3D programs. HOWEVER, those are ethical tools that do not scrape from millions of creatives, without our permission or reimbursement. To add insult to injury, I have discovered my art on AI databases. Never have I been asked for permission.<br/><br/>It has also been detrimental to new artists. I&#39;ve seen art students voice their worry and consider giving up art as a career. Without a robust new generation of creatives, how is the creative culture suppose to thrive?<br/><br/>I am also deeply concerned about the use of AI in scams and exploitation. I am more familiar with the issues of AI relating to visual arts, but AI can be easily used for deepfake, using the identities of people without their consent. Vulnerable people will be targeted and extorted, for money, blackmail, or other. Issues relating to scams and pornographic material will only worsen if there are no regulations.<br/><br/>I hope the right actions will be taken to protect the safety of creatives and individuals. This will have an effect internationally, not just within the US. I am deeply against the use of AI in its current form as it exploitative, unethical, and actively harms those it takes from.
