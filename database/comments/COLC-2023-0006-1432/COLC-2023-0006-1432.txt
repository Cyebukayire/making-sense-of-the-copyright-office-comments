You cannot train an AI on materials without copying that material into the AI. It is a clear copywrite violation to do so. This is unlike human memory, where one may remember looking at a work of art for inspiration, because one remembers much more than just the work of art. One also remembers the smell of the room, in the case of a painting the color of the wall, the temperature of the room, combing your hair in the morning, and literally millions of things unrelated to the art work. An AI is training specifically on a targeted work for the purpose of reproducing similar work. This is theft.
