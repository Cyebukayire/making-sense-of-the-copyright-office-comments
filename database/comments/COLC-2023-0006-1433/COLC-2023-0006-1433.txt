AI can be a tool for good. However, its use needs to be regulated as creators may find their work unknowingly put into AI programmes for machine learning, without their consent. If this were to happen, enough with a particular artist, or writer, it may mean that the AI can begin to copy that creator&rsquo;s style, or recreate pieces from art.<br/><br/>Creatives earn money from their unique styles, and the niches they have found for themselves to provide to people who want their art. By allowing AI to create a deluge of worse versions of this, it may put smaller creators out of business, especially if their style gets emulated by AI.<br/><br/>We saw the problem with laws around technology not keeping up in regards to data. Now is the time to keep up with the technology, and regulate the use of AI, so that people cannot just put creators work into AI learning banks without their permission. A potential way around this may be to create a &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; bank, where artists and creatives can submit work they want to, so the AI can still learn.  But they should be able to remove that work from the bank at any time, and there should be some form of verification given.
