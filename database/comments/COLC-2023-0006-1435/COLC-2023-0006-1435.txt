AI is harmful when it takes works from original creator without their consent. They should be invalid for copyright. I am very sad to see the works of my friends that they made with hardwork gets stolen with 0 efforts. They claim to have made it. They tried defending AI with using disabled as an excuse. However, a lot of disabled artist does not agree with it either. AI art maker ignored their side and basically plaster everyone original works and make a profit. It&rsquo;s not fair. If they used copyrighted content and breed them to make a profit would it be fair? I don&rsquo;t think so.
