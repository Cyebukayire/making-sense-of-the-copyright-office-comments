I oppose any categorical denial of copyright to any work generated by AI.  In the cases I&#39;ve read about (thinking specifically here of still images), the person using the AI puts significant work into tweaking the prompt given to the AI generator, and then spends more time curating the various outputs to select one which properly captures the desired look and feel.  That&#39;s oddly analogous, in my view, to the time a photographer spends waiting patiently in a field as the sun sets, hoping for the right moment to capture a flight of birds against a reddening sky.  I would agree that there&#39;s clearly *less* artistic involvement than what Beethoven put into a symphony, but to me both examples -- the photographer and the human giving prompts to an AI and curating the outputs -- are deceptively similar.<br/><br/>While it&#39;s obvious that the use of copyrighted materials to train an AI *can* violate copyright, I feel that&#39;s rarely been the case.  For me, the analogous situation is a budding artist who studies the art of others in the same field.  All artists, at all levels -- at least in their moments of honesty -- admit to &quot;copying&quot; the works of others.  Musicians will deliberately use a rhythm, or a chord progression from a prior work -- or will blatantly attempt to replicate the &quot;sound&quot; of another guitarist.  A friend and author told me that, when younger, she would studiously copy the flow of the paragraphs of an article or book written in a style she wished to imitate.  There is no doubt that her mature style today is uniquely hers, but it surely reflects, mirrors, resembles, and copies the styles of those authors whose works she admired and wished to mimic.  Again, I see analogies in the training of an AI.  The outputs are unique even though they are inspired by the elements, styles, or visual language of the works on which they were trained.<br/><br/>Of course there is no human brain inside of an AI.  The extent to which an AI is &quot;creating&quot; a work is clearly debatable, and I&#39;m not sure which side of that debate I would take today.  But I feel that good law should never lock in on a situation or condition which is temporary or evolving.  Law should be written in the abstract and should strive to be viable and reasonable even after the dust has settled and the world has moved on.  When an AI is trained on a corpus of copyrighted works and (crucially) is not simply regurgitating those works, I feel that copyright has not been violated.  Similarly the outputs of an AI clearly *can be* as unique and inventive as the works of a human artist, and those outputs should be eligible for copyright.<br/><br/>I have no opinion about what percentage of any such copyright should be assigned to the owner of the AI and what percentage to the human who is asking the AI to generate something.
