With the AI now being more prominent in the public eye, it&#39;s now time to put legal restrictions in place for the training of AI, and reducing their frequency in many fields of work.<br/><br/>As an American, it is my right and my duty to speak up about these concerns, and it is the duty of those placed in positions of power to listen. The government should serve it&#39;s citizens to protect our way of life and preserve the arts, which is a fundamental part of being human.<br/><br/>With the rise of AI creeping into the arts, it is becoming more increasingly clear that it is taking potential jobs and roles away from humans who dedicate their lives to the craft of art, writing, producing - acting, even. In the span of less than a year, I - like many others, have seen the rise of things like pornography of people with no consent, children, animals - everything you can imagine. <br/><br/>With the way AI is trained, it scrapes billions of images that are user generated, things people with flesh and blood put time into. Immorality aside, the legality of this SHOULD be clear, it&#39;s theft - plain and simple. There is a lack of transparency with how AI is trained, how the tool is used. It is a fact that AI is not neutral, it&#39;s trained on human inaccuracy - human discrimination and bias. <br/><br/>Human Rights and basic human values should not be disregarded to make way for a machine, where will the fairness and equality go once we give AI too much power? A string of code should never have more rights than a human being, why is it moral for this to steal and regenerate copyrighted or common claims content?<br/><br/>AI has even been used to create images that would imitate another human being&#39;s style, including those who are long or recently deceased. How is this moral? How does this serve us? <br/><br/>AI can have a place in this world where it can automate and make our lives easier for those who have less options than others. But the way it is currently headed without the government&#39;s input will not serve the common man, and at the end it will not serve the ones on top either.
