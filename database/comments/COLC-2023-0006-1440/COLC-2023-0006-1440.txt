I think allowing &ldquo;AI&rdquo; as it is right now being able to be copyrighted is a negligence on the part of our government and completely devalues the contributions of all of the writers and artists and creatives. AI as it is being used is being trained on real artists and those artists are not being compensated or acknowledged for their work. It is a dangerous step towards widespread dehumanization and the end of truth and beauty. I can prompt ChatGPT to write a dissertation as to why it shouldn&rsquo;t be considered intellectual property but every word and argument it has is stolen from the brilliant people who put the thought into words. It is a terrible mistake to let technology run rampant without any oversight or understanding or f the importance of the human experience.
