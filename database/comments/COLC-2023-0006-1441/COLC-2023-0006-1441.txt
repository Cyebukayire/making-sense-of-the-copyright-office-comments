I have so many concerns that it&#39;s hard to know where to start. First of all, since AI can generate so much content in so little time, I am concerned it would be used as a way to block other artists out of ideas, concepts, or markets. For example, there are many worthwhile books on historical figures like Rosa Parks. Being thoughtfully done by actual humans, these books can talk about the same person and concepts while bringing new ideas to the table and new language and not violating each other&#39;s copyright. However, what happens when AI can generate 1000 versions of a Rosa Parks book and whoever did it can claim that now every iteration of this project is copyrighted. Does this impact whether new thoughtful insights can ever be brought to the table about her life? Will it result in a horrible influx of bad faith lawsuits claiming copyright infringement anytime someone writes a book, article, or textbook including information about her life? I&#39;m concerned about the ways in which allowing AI work to be copyrighted may result in bad faith lawsuits, idea monopolizing, etc. <br/><br/>This harms both artists - who could be shut out of their own art and ideas - and the public - which would be robbed of a diversity of opinions, research, and insight, as well as buried in a clogged market of casually thrown together, likely incorrect (based on current realities of AI literally making things up) information.
