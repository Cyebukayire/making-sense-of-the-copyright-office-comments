AI Generated content can be used to quicken processes or be used as a substitute for parts of a project. However the way most AI models are built, they take in copyrighted content or the likeness of an actor and do not currently compensate, acknowledge, or request permission from the creators or actors they take from. Having AI Generated content be non-invasive may be the best option. As of right now there are developers that take from various sources and even have models built upon specific artists and actors in order to imitate their likeness. Corporations are creating forms that sign away a person&#39;s voice and likeness for indefinite periods of time, usually some sort of absurd length of time, and may include but not limited to one work day worth of salary.
