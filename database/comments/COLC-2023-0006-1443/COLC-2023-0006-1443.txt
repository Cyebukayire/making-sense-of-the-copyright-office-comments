Nicole Bonarski, I&#39;m reaching out as an artist and as someone who hasn&#39;t yet been affected negatively by AI art and AI creations. But I am watching and seeing how things are developing. I can only share my thoughts and feelings, as clumsily as they are put here, I hope your group will still read them. <br/><br/>For me AI generation was a fun toy, I could use it to start a project, but it was never the end of a project. AI can have a place in the creative sphear, but no AI art is actually copyrightable in my opinion. <br/><br/>First, the programs scrub the internet for learning. No one is credited for this. If any artist exists its the AI program itself. Not the human or company who requested the program create something. <br/><br/>Then the AI issue leads into human dignity. Does a person not own the rights to their own body and voice? In situations where a person, living or dead, is artificially recreated without permission it is unethical. Further in this situation the estate of the individual used, not the programmer or commissioner. People have the right not to be replicated and to rest in peace. <br/><br/>And Now we&#39;ve seen a rise of AI generated books, of foraging of all things! People need to be able to trust literature about nonfiction about consumable materials. I&#39;ve seen one case were a woman was listed as the author of an AI book and had trouble getting it taken down. <br/><br/>It&#39;s all quite the mess, unless AI companies are willing to pay the artists, actors, singers, voice actors, authors they use in their programs and these folk have the right to opt out of being used, and unless we have protections from AI books I don&#39;t see an ethical future, one where it is appropriate to offer copyright to AI works. <br/><br/>
