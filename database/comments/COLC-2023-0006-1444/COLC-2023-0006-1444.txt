I think AI has been stealing work without credit in both art and writing. This is something that needs to be reeled in. We wouldn&#39;t allow copying in school but it&#39;s fine if it&#39;s a robot that steals your work without credit?<br/><br/>People should be the ones who own their art. Not robots. Not people who tell robots to steal from artists who&#39;ve worked hard to hone their craft. Corporations already have taken so much from the people and now it wants our art too? Human beings are not content machines and art isn&#39;t supposed to be a medium to drive advertising. It&#39;s disgusting. Someone needs to do something.
