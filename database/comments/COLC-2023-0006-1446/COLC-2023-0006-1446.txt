Impact:<br/><br/>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re struggling to dig through the flood of comments after this went viral. You know what could summarize all the comments for you? AI.<br/><br/>AI is utterly transformative, to so many people, myself included - both in non-creative and creative works. With respect to the latter, it&#39;s allowed ideas that I&#39;ve had locked in my head my whole life due to inability or insufficient time to implement them.  It&#39;s like being given a magic wand. And it&#39;s sad to see people wanting to rip it away.<br/><br/>Creativity:<br/><br/>Just as a photographer does not write down each pixel in a photograph, the creative work is what the artist does before and after pressing &quot;the button&quot;, not what happens in the tool - whether a camera or an AI system - when the button is pressed. A person who writes &quot;a fluffy cat&quot; and clicks to generate an image, then posts the raw output, is not doing creative work, no more than a person who randomly pulls out their camera at a party, takes a quick snap, and puts it back in their pocket. But a person who spends hours adjusting prompts, hundreds or thousands of settings in AUTOMATIC1111, positioning and forming elements in ControlNet to have precise control, etc, *absolutely* is doing creative work to implement a specific vision, as is the  postprocessing work of selecting through hundreds or thousands of outputs, collaging them, fixing AI weirdness by hand, etc, to implement their vision. The question of creative activity on both photography and AI should be: &quot;what is done before and after&quot;?<br/><br/>Specificity and Search-Space Exploration:<br/><br/>In previous guidance, the Copyright Office argued a difference between AI and photography, claiming that photographers choose the position and form of elements, while AI users do not. Yet this is not accurate in either case.<br/><br/>While an artist in a studio may indeed choose the broad strokes of an image (though not the specific fine details in the generated pixels), so may an AI artist using ControlNet, which allows specification of exactly what, where, and how it should look, down to whatever detail the artist chooses.  But most photographers do not work in studios.  Ansel Adams was not out there saying, &quot;Okay, put these 80-meter spruce trees here, put this mountain back there and shape it just so, add 3 meters of snow to its top, add in a rainbow here, now cue the snow geese....&quot; He was using his intuition and experience to explore the search space for aesthetic scenes, and his knowledge of how to configure his tool (his camera) to generate pleasing scenes. This is a precise description of the process of generating quality AI art. <br/><br/>As another example: The Wildlife Photographer of the Year last year was awarded to Dmitry Kokh for &quot;House of Bears&quot;. He got temporarily stranded on a remote Russian island with an abandoned weather station, found polar bears living inside it, and photographed them. Did he know they were going to be there? Did he even plan to be stuck there? He certainly wasn&#39;t &quot;forming&quot; and &quot;positioning&quot; the bears, as amusing as the concept is. It is art because he had the eye for art and skill with the tools to take appealing pictures.<br/><br/>Training:<br/><br/>This is simple. Contrary to misinformation, AI tools are not collagers; they&#39;re logic engines.  And the amount information learned from a given image is on the order of a single byte.  An artist&#39;s entire portfolio would fit in a single tweet. If an artist draws a dragon that&#39;s in the training dataset, the AI is not learning *that* dragon - it&#39;s adding a homeopathically small amount to its understanding of dragons in general. If a user asks for a dragon in the style of that artist, it&#39;s not using *their* dragon, but its understanding of *all* dragons, from paintings to statues to cartoons. The &quot;style&quot; details are just representations of correlations to concepts that it already knows, to which each artist&#39;s individual contribution is meaninglessly small.  And indeed, if one finds (through automated or manual means) the correlations between an artist&#39;s work and individual concepts - dragons, muted palettes, broad brush strokes, fire, and so forth - they can recreate an artist&#39;s style using a model in which that artist&#39;s works were NOT part of the training dataset.<br/><br/>Banning even a &quot;homeopathic&quot; contribution of a copyrighted work to a production flies in the face of copyright law and all practicality; the  wave of lawsuits this woudl open up is endless, and extend to far beyond AI.
