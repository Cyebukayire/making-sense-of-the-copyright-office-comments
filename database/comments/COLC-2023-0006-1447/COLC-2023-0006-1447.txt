I feel that a large amount of the discourse around the implementation of Artificial Intelligence has focused on the wrong things. So much of it seems to be focused around wether or not AI generated content is &ldquo;as good&rdquo; as that created directly by people. This is, in fact, beside the point. The greatest issue with using Artificial Intelligence in creative matters is that it draws from the endless thought, care, and time put into any number of pieces of art, while being, by design, incapable of attributing any sort of valuable credit to the work being stripped for parts and cobbled together in the course of its artificial ideation. Put simply, artificial intelligence in writing, regardless of its quality or lack thereof, is little more than an exercise in automated plagiarism.
