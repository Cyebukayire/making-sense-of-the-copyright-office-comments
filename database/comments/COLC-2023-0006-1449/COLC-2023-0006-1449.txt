At its core, generative AI is a very complicated form of plagiarism that uses source material (almost always art and/or writing that is scraped from the internet without the consent of the creator) in order to create material that looks, feels, or reads like the source. AI proponents claim that this work is transformative, but the fact that everything is based on stolen assets outweighs this argument.<br/><br/>Generative AI has been overwhelmingly used to avoid paying people in creative jobs their due. Look to the strikes in Hollywood and you&#39;ll find studios wanting to replace writers with a single person &quot;cleaning up&quot; AI generated scripts. Look to studios firing art teams to replace them with a single person &quot;cleaning up&quot; AI generated art. The same story repeated over and over.<br/><br/>Our culture already devalues artists and other creatives, despite how critically important art, media, and literature are to culture as a whole. Generative AI has merit as a creative tool, but given the way it&#39;s been used up until this point I do not trust people to use it responsibly without regulation. Regulating legal uses of generative AI is of absolutely critical importance, please take the bold steps necessary to safeguard the future of media.
