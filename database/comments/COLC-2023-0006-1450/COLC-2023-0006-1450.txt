AI is incapable of creating in the same way a person is. A person can take inspiration from something to come up with a wholly unique idea or creation. AI, like all computers, is only capable of doing what you tell it to do. It cannot create anything on its own, the best it can do is sample pre-existing works and essentially make a collage that fits whatever you tell it to make, and currently the vast majority of artists have no way to prevent their works from being used by AI. It is taking someone else&rsquo;s creation without permission. AI-generated works are theft, plain and simple. <br/><br/>The only ethical use for AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; would be using it for something along the lines of getting ideas for a character design, but then actually creating the final design itself entirely on your own without directly incorporating any of the AI-generated works used as inspiration. Any finalized creation that directly uses AI-generated works should be considered theft and should be treated as such.
