The use of AI machines like ChatGPT rely heavily on scraping existing websites and information in order to pull said information together to answer a query. For art, AI does the same but with images or writing published on the web. Nothing an interface like ChatGPT creates is it&#39;s own work- it is not an artificial intelligence, even though &quot;AI&quot; has become the overarching term to define these pieces of programming. It is just that; programming. In my opinion, copyright should not be allowed on anything written, generated, or produced with a program like ChatGPT or OpenArt.
