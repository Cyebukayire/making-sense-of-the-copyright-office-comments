Thank you for your time. AI is an incredibly powerful tool, and is completely unable to be controlled long-term. What looks harmless now could morph beyond recognition faster than we can adapt to AI&#39;s growth. Art is already being stolen and mushed together, with no credit to the years artists have spent honing  skills and given their passion to. Restrictions must be in place to protect creators, or creation will be stagnant. Stagnance creates unrest.
