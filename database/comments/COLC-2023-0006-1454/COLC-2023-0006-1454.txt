I am completely opposed to the use of artificial intelligence trained on my work (As many models are, due to the nature of how OpenAI and other companies scraped the web without regard for usage or copyright). I would like them to be heavily regulated in order to protect myself and other artists from losing our livelihood to machine models trained on the works we ourselves did not consent to feed them.
