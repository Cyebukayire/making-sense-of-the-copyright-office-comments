I do not believe that heavy-handed restrictions on AI development and use is a good idea in the short or long term.  AI tools are in a similar place now as the Internet was in its infancy, a new technology that is developing rapidly because people do not have to navigate a complex regulatory framework in order to work on it.  While some seek to put the genie back in the bottle, I think this is a fool&#39;s errand; the proliferation of open-source AI programs puts these tools in the hands of the masses, where they belong.  If AI is heavily regulated, only large corporations will be able to use it, and the entire field will suffer.<br/><br/>AI models are trained on existing work, much of which is copyrighted.  While one could argue that this is theft of copyrighted material, how is it any different from an author being inspired by the books they&#39;ve read, or an artist by the pictures they&#39;ve seen?  It&#39;s the same general principle, only a computer can make these relations faster.  I fear that regulating AI by banning it from using copyrighted material would not only hurt its development, it could open the door for further abuse of the copyright system; if you ban an AI from creating things that are inspired by something else, who&#39;s to say that couldn&#39;t be extended to human artists as well?  It threatens to hurt the entire concept of fair use and transformative works that is the backbone of how culture evolves.  Furthermore, by downloading a model, you don&#39;t gain a copy of the material used to train it, so piracy arguments are moot for end users.  (Honestly, our heavily-restrictive copyright system needs a major overhaul, but that&#39;s outside the scope of this comment.)<br/><br/>In the end, AI is simply a tool.  I do not think that it&#39;s logical to say that an AI image cannot be copyrighted because a person used a computer to help create it; the person still originated the creative impulse, so they should be able to take credit for the work (though a metadata tag to show it&#39;s AI-generated is not a bad idea, something which is often already done).  People who haven&#39;t been able to express themselves to their liking because they lack traditional skillsets are now putting their ideas out there for all to see.  I implore you to tread lightly and allow AI development to continue.
