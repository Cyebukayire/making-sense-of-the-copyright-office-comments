As a full-time professional writer, the idea that my work can be fed to an AI without my say-so is extremely disturbing. That a company might hire me to write for them once, and then have the right to use that and regurgitate work in my own voice and style without further payment or accreditation is worrying. This is not to mention the damage AIs taking free-to-access online stories for &quot;inspiration&quot; has upon both my own desire to publish and the accessibility and visibility those stories once enjoyed. Companies must not be allowed to move the goalposts on copyright. An AI which is trained using my published work isn&#39;t &quot;Informed by&quot; that work, it is stealing my copyright, my voice, style, training, and experience, gained through years of study and practice.
