AI is undermining human creativity and destroying incentives for human creation and thought. If AI outputs that are solely created by machine are allowed to be copyrighted, there will be no reason at all gor employers to pay human creatives or staff. Millions of people will lose their jobs in every sector and industry. Leaving millions unemployed and fighting for decreasing numbers of very low wage jobs. Workers will lose their own rights to make way for the rights of unfeeling and nonliving machines. It is already happening in hollywood where companies have threatened to take ai and replace their hard-working animators, writers, and actors in favor of machine output trained on the work of the very people they refuse to respect and pay. All creative industries will suffer the same fate if AI is left unchecked, and it is among the bleakest futures I can imagine. <br/><br/>AI as a small part of the process of creation can be fine, but human creativity and skill MUST be the most important and protected thing in the law. <br/>I want a future where young artists are inspired to hone and develop their natural skills without fear that a machine can take all of their hard work away from them. I want people to continue to create and thrive and push the envelope of what is possible. AI outputs should NEVER be copyrightable by law or no one will be willing to create again in fear of having their own work scraped away and fed into a machine that then has the rights instead of the human creator. <br/>Humans are creators, innovators, imagining, and ALIVE. The work of humans should be the ONLY content protected by copyright. Machines are unfeeling, nonliving, advanced algorithms designed to enrich its programmers. The outputs of machines should never be protected under copyright law. That would be a mockery to human creatives and a pure violation of their rights as human beings.
