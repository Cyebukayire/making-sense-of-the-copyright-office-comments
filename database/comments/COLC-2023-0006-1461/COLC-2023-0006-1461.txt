Ai art as it exists now is a violation of basic copyright. All the datasets used have been stolen and scraped without the consent from the creators and copyright holders. All writing on ai and all art on ai have been taken without compensation to the original creators. Now ai scraping and meddling has been introduced into various writing programs and social media sites including personal non-publically shared documents in Google drives to be scraped for corporate profits which are not being shared with actual content creators. Ai data sets and scraping are unethical and violates basic property and copyrights laws and rights of all the people from all over the world.
