AI-created works should be non-copyrightable. The US copyright office has previously held that works created by non humans are non-copyrightable (see the controversy over David J. Slater&#39;s monkey photographs). As works created by AI are definitionally non-human creations, they too should fall under this ruling of being non-copyrightable.
