Very simply, AI-generated art and writing is ultimately the product of an algorithm -- software, not human beings engaged in the act of artistic creation. I should no more be able to copyright AI-generated art than I could a playlist generated by Spotify.<br/><br/>Further, a human directing an AI program to create a piece is no different than a human directing another human artist to create a piece. Unless the two parties have explicitly agreed to share copyright, or the artist has agreed to relinquish copyright to their (human) client, the final product legally belongs to the artist who created it, not the individual giving that artist instructions. That same principle must be applied to AI; the human is giving a program directions, therefore has no implicit or tacit right to claim copyright for whatever is produced.
