AI is a tool that has been developed using copyrighted material without permission (often requiring a violation of copyright law simply to create a data set) for the purpose of directly replacing the labor the the person whose copyright was violated. The jobs left afterward will be cleaning up the sub-standard writing and art created by these tools in order to make them simply passable, and this will be just as much work at less pay for a much lower quality end-product. AI is fundamentally backward facing--it can&#39;t be responsive to other art. It can&#39;t invent. It&#39;s just a parrot, and that means the works produced are not just not copyrightable (as a person did not make them), but if the model doesn&#39;t have enough input, it often directly copies existing work without sufficient deviation from the original, and there are no controls that let the users of AI tools tell the output is plagiarized. Artists will have to sue constantly. The art labor market will collapse, and then there will be nothing to feed the AI art models. Copyright law doesn&#39;t just exist to protect the rights of individuals, but a future where artists can make art and be paid at all. I urge you to require explicit artist permission to be used in AI art models and a public log of the data set used if it&#39;s for sale and to make outputs fully not copyrightable.
