The problem with AI is not the need to protect AI owners from artist infringement, but rather the inverse.<br/><br/>As someone who is a personal friend of several artists across different fields, every single one of them has worries or even specific examples of AI being used to take their livelihoods. A friend who makes tabletop roleplay game maps has closed down her formerly profitable website due to people using AI trained on her models and maps to churn out cheaper versions of her work. I know authors whos names and books are being used to train AI and write novels, and there is no protection in the copyright laws which prevents this. <br/><br/>Human artists, when their work is used to train AI should be entitled to fair compensation and royalties for the duration of that AI&#39;s use. Humans whose image or likeness is used for AI models should recieve compensation for as long as the AI is used to create a profit for its owner as well. It should not be a profitable enterprise to steal the intellectual or creative property of other people and mass produce it with AI against the wishes of the original creator, and it is detrimental to the freedom and creativity of artists everywhere to allow it to continue.
