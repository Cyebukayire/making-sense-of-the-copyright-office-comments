AI does not deserve protective rights. The production of AI knowledge is dependent on the scrapping of other works - everything it learns is some form of copying, theft, or copyright infringement. If AI could be trusted to learn off of only offered works, with consent given by the intellectual property owners, that would be defensible. As it stands now, protecting AI is nothing more than protecting thievery. AI being given copyright protection will allow AI companies with money to steal from small companies and individual creators who will not have the finances to fight that legally. Even now, AI is being used to write books, &quot;scientific&quot; papers and new articles under real people&#39;s name, full of errors and false opinion, presenting a real danger to their livelihoods and repuations. Do not include AI works into copyright law. Exclude them, make it clear that AI is not original work and cannot be claimed or protected as such.
