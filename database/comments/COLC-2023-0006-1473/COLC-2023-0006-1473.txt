To replicate anyone&#39;s work without permission using machine learning or otherwise is quite simply and obviously direct theft, whether for profit or not, and to use an actor&#39;s entire visage and voice without permission is identity theft in the most literal sense. People&#39;s work and a person&#39;s image, regardless of use, should be protected under intellectual and privacy laws, and it&#39;s ridiculous that they aren&#39;t already protected.
