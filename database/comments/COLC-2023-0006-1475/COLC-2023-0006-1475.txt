Hello.<br/><br/>My name is Margaret. I&#39;m not a professional artist - but I am a hobbyist who happily shares her art online, with like minded individuals. I take commissions from time to time to supplement my income, both for illustrations and for written pieces. As such, I feel I do have a right to say my piece on AI, despite my direct liveihood not being impacted by these decisions.<br/><br/>AI, by itself, is a lovely technological innovaction. It&#39;s genuinely amazing we can generate images with a click of a button. What&#39;s not amazing is that the end result of that click is based on thousands of uncredited, uncompenstated illustrations made by people who need to eat and pay their bills. Art is routinely stolen on the internet - as easy as a right-click - and these AI training modules make the process even worse. They steal copyrighted pieces without flinching and use them to generate lifeless copies. You may be aware that SAG/AFTRA and WGA are currently on strike over these very issues. It&#39;s not just art thats being stolen, but words, and even faces. Human faces and voices are being stolen without compensation or credit, likenessnes being used into perpetuity by corporations. AI threatens the liveihoods of people not by being &quot;better&quot; then they are, but by stealing their work. AI modules cannot exist without humans doing the work which it trains itself off.<br/><br/>Copyright is essentially moot with this new AI system. If something merely existing on the internet is enough to place it inside an AI training program, then nothing is actually protected. In my view, nothing an AI creates should be protected under copyright, as AI cannot make anything without infringing on a real artist or writer&#39;s copyright. As AI continues to expand throughout the industry, its imperative Congress look at its current uses and anitcipate future use to protect content creators as well as the IP of actors. <br/>
