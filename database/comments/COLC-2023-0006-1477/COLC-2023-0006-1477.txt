Artificial Intelligence is a useful tool but should not be able to be used and have an individual claim it as their own personal work. Being able to use it for inspiration is perfect.<br/><br/>My reasoning behind why an individual should not be allowed to claim is as their own work is the following:<br/>&bull;The time, work, and talent that it takes to create art (whether it be writing or drawn/painted) is not their. All they did is write a prompt and had the AI do the rest<br/>&bull;AI takes from existing works and Frankensteins it into &quot;new&quot; work. This is theft and very unfair to actual creators.<br/><br/>My defense on why AI using others work is different from a human artist getting inspiration from other artists is the following:<br/>&bull;The artist needs to put in the work to create it on their own and their own quirks will show and it&#39;ll be it&#39;s own thing completely because of that. However, AI takes existing works and Frankensteins them into something people want to claim is its own work
