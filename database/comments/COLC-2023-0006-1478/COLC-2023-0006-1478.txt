I am a comic book artist, and as someone in the industry, I can say with certainty that AI content generation will not only affect my livelihood, but also steal my content. It has been proven time and time again that AI content will sometimes take an artist&rsquo;s work wholesale and add minor changes. This cannot be allowed to happen. There must be regulations that keep the intellectual property of artists safe. <br/>In terms of affecting my livelihood, companies are already attempting to branch out into AI options, which devalues my own job. Art is a business, and when AI is introduced, less actual workers are needed, and more constraints will be put on us. Expectations to work faster than possible, for cheaper and cheaper. Us industry artists aren&rsquo;t rich. Very few of us can afford to have our field&rsquo;s already small salaries become reduced. <br/>On a personal note, I am someone who is a perfect fit for my field. But my skills rarely transfer to other fields. Without this job, I&rsquo;m unsure of how valuable of a society member I can truly be.
