To put it simply, generative AI does not have creative input to differentiate its &ldquo;art&rdquo; vs. a person&rsquo;s creative input. There is no true original idea, sometimes someone has an idea for a book or a piece of art, but later find out that someone else already did that idea. If said person would still go through with the same idea without creative differences then we enter into copyright issues. However, if the person makes changes to the idea, while maintaining its essence, while not an &ldquo;original idea&rdquo;, it has the creative difference to stand itself apart from other pieces of art while still drawing ideas from them. This is where we also enter into the &ldquo;legally distinct&rdquo; areas of copyright. Allowing generative AI and its supporters to copyright the AI&rsquo;s &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; would blur these lines so much, that it would lead to many cases having the same premise of &ldquo;This AI copied my work&rdquo; and it won&rsquo;t be limited to AI detractors vs AI supporters, it would lead to different generative AI supporters to sue each other because the other &ldquo;copied&rdquo; their work. Personally, I believe that AI and its supporters should be prohibited from copyrighting their &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;, full stop.
