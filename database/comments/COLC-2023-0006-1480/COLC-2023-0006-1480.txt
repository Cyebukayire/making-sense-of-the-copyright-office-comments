I think that AI needs to be regulated, especially for Actor/Performers. Every actor has the right to consent over their images and likenesses and should be fairly compensated, just like a real performance, with a residual formula that like what SAG-AFTRA is asking for and referenced to the TV/Theatrical/Streaming contract.
