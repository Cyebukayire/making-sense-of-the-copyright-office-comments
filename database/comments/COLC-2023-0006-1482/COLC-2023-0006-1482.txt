My understanding is that AI as it currently exists relies heavily on the data it is trained on to then &ldquo;create&rdquo; a response to an inquiry. Since it doesn&rsquo;t perform any true transformative processes to the original work it was trained on I don&rsquo;t see how it cannot be infringing upon the copyright of the original artist. My understanding is that at this time it requires human direction to produce anything (generally a prompt provided and then reviewed until the human requesting the response is satisfied). As such, the AI itself is not truly capable of making decisions autonomously nor has any drive to make them. Without the desire or capacity for independent creation, AI is dependent upon the human user to create anything. Overall, I don&rsquo;t see how AI can make anything that is copyrighted. The person using the AI is the one who is making the final product and the original artists which are used for the training data are the ones who have made any actual copyrighted works. Without truly transformative processes being done to the original work , they are in fact infringing upon the copyright of others.
