I believe the use of AI in commercialized art is grounds for a copyright mess because at its core, AI steals elements from all over in order to replicate often without the written or expressed consent of the artists or parties that own the art. And while AI can be useful, as it stands now, it&#39;s being used to replace the wrong group of people in order to justify paying them less. An AI could not write Shakespear or Juice. AI could not draw The Birth of Venus or The Night Watch. It cannot capture the intricacies that we love of the arts yet it&#39;s being treated as the next big thing while showing no love or respect for the field its replicating because there is no one regulating it.
