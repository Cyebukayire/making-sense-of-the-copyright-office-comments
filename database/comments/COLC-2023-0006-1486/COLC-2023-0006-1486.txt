AI isn&#39;t copyrightable. AI generates works by running statistics on the most likely arrangement a work is to be found in based on the prompt used. It does this by being trained on others works both volunteered and stolen to find these arrangements. It&#39;s not creating anything that can be linked to one sole originator for full legal control therefore its not capable of being copyrighted.
