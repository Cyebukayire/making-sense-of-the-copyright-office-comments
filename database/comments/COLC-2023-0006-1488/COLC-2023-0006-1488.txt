Right now, the technology branded &ldquo;AI&rdquo; does not actually represent true intelligence, capable of generating new ideas or synthesizing influences in a unique manner. It is a stochastic parrot, only able to mash up existing concepts from within a given learning set which were all originally created by people. Individuals or organizations using AI commercially should not be allowed to copyright that work, as they are stealing previously posted human creations. This is simply how the technology works - it&rsquo;s not even a judgement call. If an AI creates something, it is BY DEFINITION using existing work, and there is no way to guarantee that AI respects existing copyright rulings in what it uses to create said work.
