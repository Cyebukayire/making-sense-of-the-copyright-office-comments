Al is not violating any copyright for analyzing Bob Ross&#39; paintings for the same reasons that Bob Ross is not a plagiarist for his study of the methods and style of Bill Alexander. Should artists not wish for their work to be studied or analyzed by machines, it is their responsibility to keep it from being stored in publicly accessible digital spaces.<br/>The creations of prompt engineering and careful database curation directly impact the quality, style, and results of an image generated through tools such as Stable Diffusion. Through the creative process, and using these Al tools, an artist is able to make unique images.<br/>These unique images are not the result of any single image within the dataset, because the images are not contained within the dataset. The dataset contains the patterns learned from analysis of upwards of a million pictures, gathered from larger image models provided by companies like Google for nearly three decades.<br/>An artists &#39;style&#39; is not and has never been held up as intellectual property in the United States, except in cases where a party was &#39;passing off&#39; the imitated work to be an original work of another artist. Al is limited by its vary nature to only understand style when it comes to the works of the majority of artists.<br/>With the exception of incredibly iconic and prolifically spread art pieces (e.g. Mona Lisa, Starry Night, etc.) it is nearly impossible for an Al to copy a specific image. It is literally impossible for a text-prompt to create a pixel perfect recreation of any image chosen beforehand.<br/>In summary, Artificially Intelligence cannot in its current form violate US copyright law, and the creations of artists who use tools such as Stable Diffusion is their copyrighted intellectual property.
