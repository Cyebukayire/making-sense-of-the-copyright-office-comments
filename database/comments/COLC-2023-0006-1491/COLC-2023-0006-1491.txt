&quot;AI&quot; generated art (including but not limited to, music, text, illustrations, etc) should not be copyrightable. It is not produced by a human being, and the process through which it is produced is not attributable to the human owners (users or creators) of the software itself. The only elements during this process where a person created art (deserving of copyright protection) are the samples used as training data for the AI. The generated output, based on that training data, can not be understood as having been created by any person.
