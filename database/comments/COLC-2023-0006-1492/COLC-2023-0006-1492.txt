I am writing to show my support of copyright protection, and the copyright office. I am opposed to generative artificial intelligence and it&rsquo;s scraping of copyrighted material across the Internet. Be they an artist or non-artist, in today&rsquo;s and tomorrow&rsquo;s digital age we, the humans, demand to retain our basic copyright protections. Without them, the human race will lose its freedom of creation and expression.
