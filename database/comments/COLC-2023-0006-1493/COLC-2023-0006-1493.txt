I am an artist at heart and I firmly believe that AI as it is sourced now is always theft. People who post visual art online, voice actors, and even just people&rsquo;s personal pictures are being scraped and reformed by these programs without their consent. I believe that it is not only immoral, but detrimental to the integrity of art and media in general.
