Thanks for making this open to comments.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m a small-time artist, and I&rsquo;ve been making art since I could hold a pencil. I&rsquo;ve been watching ai get bigger and treat art not as a product of a lifetime of work and passion, but merely as a product for them to profit off of. It&rsquo;s made me worry about posting my art anywhere because it could be easily stolen and put in an ai dataset without my knowledge or consent.<br/><br/>I believe the Copyright Office should only allow ai to train off of works in the public domain, or on works where the creator has given explicit permission. It would protect artists of all stripes, and cement art as being sacred things that nations are built off of, not tools for endless consumption.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
