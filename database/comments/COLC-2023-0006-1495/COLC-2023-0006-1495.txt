I have seen so many artists of all kinds (writers, painters, musicians) being crowded out of their industries due to the proliferation of machine learning (erroneously called AI to mislead people about what it actually is), and quite frankly, it does not stop there.  &quot;AI&quot; has taken jobs away from translators as well, and it actively seeks now to move on to taking them from actors, and there is beginning to be talk of even more industries.  It is driven purely by profit, because an &quot;AI&quot; does not have to be paid, so the many shortcomings of machine learning are ignored.  This tool only predicts the words or pixels or piece of code its algorithm indicates are most likely to come next.  There is no thought, there is no analysis - it simply blindly follows a statistical model.  That statistical model is built off stolen work.  This &quot;industry&quot; desperately needs regulation, for the sake of not only the people whose work is stolen for it, but the people whose jobs it aims to absorb and for the sake of simply having actually accurate information out there.
