Automated generated text is a technology that could have many uses in the future, but in none of the areas that seems to hold the publics interest. Not only is art generated by automation the last thing I or many people want, it simply, technologically, does not meet standards as it can only steal from the work of others and not create anything of it&#39;s own. I am greatly concerned with the state of copyright as it pertains to ai, how if it is allowed to run rampant, if anyone can truly be said to own anything at all, and if I will be paid for the work I did on a new, upcoming AI generated film, or if I will be left on the side with the other writers
