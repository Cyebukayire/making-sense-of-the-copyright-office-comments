I am extremely concerned by my work being scraped by generative AI models without my consent. Most websites where works may be published do not allow people to include a flag to opt out of AI training, and even when this is possible, I have no doubt that it is frequently getting ignored by AI bots. My works are published openly and for free on the internet because I do not like monetizing my work, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I consent to it being stolen, plagiarized, or used for any other means than reading it for appreciation.<br/><br/>While I am not American, I believe American lawmakers stepping up to the plate and putting in place laws to restrict how AI models may use publicly available content on the internet is tantamount to curbing this issue. Right now, the industry has no respect for the consent of writers, whether they are fiction writers, news writers, bloggers, or just regular netizens posting their thoughts on X or another social media. This is unacceptable to me. As the copyrights holder of my works, I am the one who gets to decide what uses are permitted with my works, and I was never asked for my consent for my work to be used for AI training. I believe it should be my prerogative to consent or not to this use of my work.
