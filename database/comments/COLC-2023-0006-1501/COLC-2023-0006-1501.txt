I believe that AI generated content and products shouldn&#39;t be directly copywritable until such time that AI is deemed independent creatively and intellectually from a corporation or organization.<br/><br/>Representing the products of an algorithm as novel despite it being dubiously generated from harvesting information without recompense to the originators should not be rewarded with protections. A human invests the time and money in curating and distilling using their skills, trying to adapt that to &#39;but on a computer&#39; is misrepresenting the process which this has been created.
