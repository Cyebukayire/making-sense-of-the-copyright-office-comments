My husband is a software engineer who works with AI. I am more of a artsy type but from what he has explained to me i understand that, AI is in its infancy and is still learning from what humans input into it. <br/><br/>They run tests and input information, and expose AI to snatches of the internet. But it&rsquo;s all pre existing knowledge and data that the AI is computing and then spitting out an answer that is extrapolated from previous creations and discoveries.<br/><br/>How can you copyright something that is essentially plagiarized from other people&rsquo;s work?<br/><br/>The machine isn&rsquo;t coming up with the ideas or doing the hard work of creation it&rsquo;s taking other people&rsquo;s inventions, art, and writings and using them as variables in an equation to produce a result. It&rsquo;s like that selfie a monkey took, the camera belonged to the photographer but he couldn&rsquo;t copyright the picture.<br/><br/>The monkey mimicked the photographer&rsquo;s actions and produced a photo. AI mimics the works of artists, writers and software engineers and what it produces cannot belong to the AI nor the person who prompted the machine and then sat back to see what it produced.
