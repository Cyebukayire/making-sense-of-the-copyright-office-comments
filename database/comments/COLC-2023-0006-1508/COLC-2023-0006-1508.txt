I work as a freelance copy writer and have seen all of my clients disengage severely since Chat GPT and AI became prominent. I&#39;m losing my livlihood. the only jobs for copywriting out there now are jobs to edit an article an AI wrote, for less money and less time than writing one myself-- but of course I&#39;ll have to rewrite the entire article because tge AI brings in bogus examples or facts, uses poor logic and won&#39;t achieve the objective of the article. I often write for insurance companies, &quot;what is flood insurance,&quot; and so on. With an AI article, readers are getting more confusing, sometimes completely false information, which then can only make it harder to understand what they really need. Widespread AI use is damaging my work snd also leading innocent readers into false information.
