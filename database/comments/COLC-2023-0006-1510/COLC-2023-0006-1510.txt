I assume there&#39;s already lines drawn in the discussion by what constitutes &quot;AI use&quot;: with spellcheck on one end and outright plagiarism on the other. When that&#39;s established, yeah, let&#39;s talk about plagiarism. When humans write from research, it&#39;s considered plagiarism even when ideas are reworded but the source isn&#39;t cited. How is it not plagiarism to feed the writing of others into a program to make it spit out &quot;more of the same&quot;? There are many other disturbing issues involving corporations using this AI generated content to avoid paying actual creatives, but I can&#39;t speak to that as confidently as on the subject of plagiarism.
