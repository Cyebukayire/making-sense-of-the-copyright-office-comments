AI generated content is just summary of other work. It is not writing, nor is it creation; it is paraphrase. The fact that we now know it is paraphrase of stolen books, including stolen memoirs, means this tool is no more &quot;intelligent&quot; than a tenth grader turning in a plagiarized book report. AI text and image generators have a lot of potential for teaching English Language Learners to write, and for teaching non-artists to visualize. But they are not creation, and they are nothing more than pretty-looking search engines.
