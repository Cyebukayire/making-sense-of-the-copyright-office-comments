As a writer, it is beyond offensive to know that my words and isea can be copied and used by AI software to make substandard material that some wish to profit from. Years of time and energy have been put into my craft, and knowing that there are computer programs and ethically questionable people who wish to use that material to hurt myself and other creators is deplorable. An AI bot will never know the struggle of writing the perfect turn of phrase or spending days and months pouring its soul into its creation. <br/><br/>Copyright law exists to protect people, not soulless computer programs. <br/><br/>Do not allow AI to be given any form of protected status. It is stolen from millions of people, but it is not a person. The only people who wish to use AI are those who cannot create for themselves, but wish to profit on those who do.
