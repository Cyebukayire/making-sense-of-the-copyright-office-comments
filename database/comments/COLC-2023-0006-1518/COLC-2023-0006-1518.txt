Hello, I am a product designer and I am concerned with unregulated AI as it can cause issues when copyrighting your own idea, and even more issues when copyrighted ideas are used by other designers unknowingly. Not only does this halt production, but opens a whole chapter of legal problems, making it hard for designers to share ideas and safely label them as their own.
