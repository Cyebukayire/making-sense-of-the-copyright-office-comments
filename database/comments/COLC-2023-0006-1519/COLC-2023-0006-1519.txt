All this talk about &quot;AI&quot; is a ruse by engineers to make the theft of intellectual property seem more legitimate.  None of these &quot;AI&quot; chatbots or &quot;AI&quot; artists are actually AI - they are not intelligent and are barely more advanced than the auto-fill function on your smart phone.  They are fed data by their owners and then when asked to produce something, they regurgitate the average response, and by average I mean the mathematical average.  If you ask a chatbot to tell you a story about a dog, the chatbot will scan every datapoint it has that is a story and is about dogs, determine the most common factors, and offer them up to you as though it came up with themselves.  These &quot;AI&quot; tools are not actually capable of coming up with anything unique.  They are doing the equivalent of putting fifty essays on the same subject into a paper shredder (and let&#39;s be realistic here, they stole those fifty essays), then rearranging the words to form a new essay on the same subject, which the owners of the &quot;AI&quot; then turn around and hold up as unique and worthy of both praise and pay.  None of these &quot;AI&quot; engineers should have any right to copyright what their robot produces because it isn&#39;t really producing anything, just chopped up pieces of real work stolen from other people.  Thank you for your time.
