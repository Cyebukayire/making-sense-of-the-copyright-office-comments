I believe that most Generative &quot;AI&quot; technologies (Midjourney, StableDiffusion,etc.) are fundamentally violations of the principles of copyright, if not necessarily the letters of copyright law. It is well known that these technologies rely on Intellectual Property neither owned nor licensed by the companies running the &quot;AI&quot;. I, and many others, including artists, writers, filmmakers, and other creatives believe that Generative &quot;AI&quot; is not in any way intelligent and therefor does not &quot;create&quot; anything, rather just re-configuring a mass of stolen IP. These technologies must be regulated and their free access to unguarded content must be denied.
