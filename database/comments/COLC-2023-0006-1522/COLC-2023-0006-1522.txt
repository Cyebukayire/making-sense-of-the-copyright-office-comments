Artificial intelligence does not create. At the moment it steals what is already made and using equations combines them. The base for their output is copied with no individual change to make the work transformative. AI does not add anything from itself. Similarly the programmer or prompted of the AI does not create. At no point do they add to a creation they only suggest and put in parameters by which the AI works under. <br/>On the topic of copyright or ownership, the AI does not benefit from its product it does not learn from what it produces, just from what it steals and changed parameters from the programmer or user. The AI does not depend on creating and does not benefit from copyright protection.<br/>The programmer or prompted have no direct hand in creating a copyrightable product. They fill the AI with stolen art, from artists, who themselves were involved in evert aspect of their art, and tell the AI to mash it all together to spit out shapes resembling what it was trained on. The programmer and the prompted do not add anything to what was made and so nothing in the piece is copyrightable except by the arts made by.the origional artist.<br/>The programmer and prompted should not be able to steal and benefit from other artist work. Especially if they are selling what they made with no compensation to the artists they are stealing from. This applies to visual art, written art, auditory art and any other method creators can be stolen from.
