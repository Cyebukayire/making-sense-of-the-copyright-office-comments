I&#39;m very concerned about AI and Copyright issues. AI scrolls through the internet for previously written articles, novels, blogs, scripts and whatever it can access and essentially rips off that material to form anything it comes up with. This is a copyright violation and infringement on the intellectual property of writers and creators of all types. It&#39;s absolutely frightening that it will plagiarize as well as attempt to fraudulently mimic another writer&#39;s voice. There must be regulations not only for this reason but for the fact that AI can (and already has) put people out of work. Where does civilization go when people have lost careers, ability to financially support themselves and families, and lose their purpose in life to robots? Something must be done. I urge you to consider the value of humans and the future of humanity.<br/>
