People have spent large portions of their lives developing writing and artistic styles and techniques. To have a computer simply scan and copy their work, sometimes even using their names or scoping art before it&#39;s even complete, is infuriating and insulting to creators and audience alike. Computers are literally stealing the livelihoods of these people, and a computer, as a machine, has no rights. There should be zero copyright protection for AI creations or for the people who program them to scrape data from established artists.
