It is my firm, unyielding belief that AI generated content should not be eligible for copyright protection. <br/><br/>All output from generative artificial intelligence software is wholly based upon the use of pre-existing original works, produced by artists, actors, writers and others within creative fields of work, a field of work deserving of respect for the level of skill and commitment it requires. AI generated content requires no such ability, merely requiring prompts from the user and no technical knowledge. To me, this undermines the livelihoods and efforts of creatives.<br/><br/>AI generated content cannot be considered original or sufficiently altered from its derivatives, due to directly requiring these contributions from the  creators of the works the generations are based upon, as anything available on the internet can easily be used as a source for generative software. As there are no protections currently in place for creatives from AI, allowing AI generated works to be copyrighted would effectively allow individuals to profit from the work and intellectual properties of others. Potential protections would be near impossible to effectively enforce, furthermore, owing to the ease of acquiring source material from the internet. Furthermore, as the barrier to entry for prompting AI generations is low, this allows the improper use of other creatives&#39; potentially copyrighted material. <br/><br/>In the case of voice AI specifically, this would effectively enable the copyright of individual&#39;s likenesses, and potentially threatens the livelihood and rights of the individual the voice AI is sourced from.<br/><br/>Lastly, from a more philosophical perspective, allowing AI generations to become a mainstay in media destroys the soul of creativity. Creatives commit to their work for many reasons, some to convey a message, some to help others, some to immortalise a particular sentiment, some simply because they enjoy their line of work. <br/>AI, while &#39;intelligent&#39;, is not able to think and create independently, and cannot imbue these generations with any meaning or find any purpose in the act of creating, reducing the process to merely a means to an end.<br/><br/>To summarise, AI generations actively threaten the livelihood of and undermines the skills and abilities of creatives, doing so purely based upon the theft and misuse of those same creatives&#39; work, and allowing these to be copyrighted would be an insult towards them.
