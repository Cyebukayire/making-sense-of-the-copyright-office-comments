Artificial intelligence work shouldn&#39;t be able to be copy righted  as a human didn&#39;t make the picture or writing that would be copyright. Similar to how a picture an animal takes cannot be protected under copyright.<br/>Also this AI is trained on the art and writing of people who may or may not be in the public domain, meaning that the AINis being trained under &#39;stolen&#39; work, which could cause some problems legally.
