AI-generated content should not be able to be copyrighted, because AI does not &quot;create,&quot; it merely recycles the material on which it has been trained. Much of that material was scraped from human creators without their consent. In addition, the human operator of the AI generator is likewise creating nothing, merely entering a prompt, and should not be permitted to enforce copyright on the product that they happened to deem worthwhile. To put it crudely, dicking around on Midjourney for 15 minutes is not an act of creativity; at best, it&#39;s collating some other artist&#39;s stolen work for your own enjoyment.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t want to live in a country where humans do backbreaking labor while machines generate art.
