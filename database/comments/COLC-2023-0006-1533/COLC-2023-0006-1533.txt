Can&#39;t say as I like the idea of my data&mdash;face, voice, art, whatever&mdash;being used to create profitable things I get no payment for and didn&#39;t agree to contribute to. Nor do I much like the concept of deep fakes. Seems likely to hurt people to me. AI&#39;s fine and all, but the folks running it should only be able to feed in data if they&#39;ve got the data owners&#39; permission to do that.
