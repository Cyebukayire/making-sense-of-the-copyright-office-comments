AI &#39;authorship&#39; horrifies me for several reasons.<br/>1. The work currently created by programs like ChatGPT is prone to error, and tends not to get fact-checked. Propagation of misinformation is injurious to the public good.<br/>2. AI generation of text, art, and voices as a cheap alternative to live workers damages their livelihood in a very real way. In particular, young people trying to enter these fields -- without any kind of marketable name or body of work to tempt potential employers -- are likely to be starved out before they even start. That damages people&#39;s employment opportunities, and it damages artistic traditions as a collection of techniques passed down from experienced workers to their juniors. It&#39;s astroturf compared to a blossoming meadow.<br/>3. Many AI generators have learned on content that was copyrighted and without the consent of the creators, with no royalties in sight. The owners of these generators claim that the source content is scrambled enough that they&#39;re not infringing fair use, but I&#39;ve seen AI &#39;art&#39; reproduce watermarks before now. It is, at best, tacky.<br/><br/>Thank you for listening to my opinions.
