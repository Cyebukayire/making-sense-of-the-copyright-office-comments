AI is a misnomer for what is actually only a machine that can only spit out what it&#39;s had input. There is no original thought or wording from any of the AI iterants- they are basically plagarism machines. Additionally, they have no fact check algorithms built in, so blatant falsehoods can be generated as an &#39;answer@ to the prompts. Take the AI generated books on edible mushrooms for example. They contain completely inaccurate information that could get someone killed, and there is no regulatory office to control this spread of misinformarion. AI as it stands now is actively harmful. The people who build AI generators have no regard for who&#39;s work they steal to &#39;train&#39; the machine- and as such interfere with the livelihoods of those people so that others can profit from theft.
