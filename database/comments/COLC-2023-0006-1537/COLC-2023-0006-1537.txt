I&#39;m sure AI can be very helpful in some fields, but also it literally removes any humanity from it&#39;s work - it lacks a fundamental understanding of emotion or empathy or how humans interact with their own spaces and without that in stories or artwork the world is a barren place.  Algorithms can never emulate the beating, bleeding heart of a person alive to the world and people around them.  So when it comes to art - written or painted or however, AI can not do that even if it may be useful somehow in some other field.  (This is of course even assuming AI gets it&#39;s algorithms working properly to be effective in some field somehow because as of now it rather sucks).  Have a good day.
