Companies that specialize in AI generated images and text should not be allowed to use copyrighted art or writing to train their software. Using an artist&rsquo;s copyrighted work without an agreement to compensate them is theft, regardless of the tool used or the intended purpose.<br/><br/>The technology is wholly derivative of existing works. It does not produce anything original and there is no intention behind the creation process that could fall under fair use in the way a human-created collage could. Generative AI services exist and operate under the faulty logic that since everything posted on the internet is available for free, that means it has no value and the artists have no right to complain if someone uses it for unapproved purposes. All this thinking does is drive artists off the open internet, as it becomes increasingly unsafe to market their work there, as violation of copyright law is normalized by tech companies who profit off work that does not belong to them.<br/><br/>Companies that require the services of artists and writers to make profit should not be able to copyright or claim the rights too any media that uses generative images or writing. They should not be able to demand AI rights when hiring artists, actors, and writers as a requirement of their contracts.
