The advent of Artificial Intelligence in the last year or so has been quite stunning. While new technological advancements are often met with both excitement and fear, the end result usually lies somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>What is particularly terrifying st the moment is the speed with which the major tech companies are rushing to incorporate AI into their products with little to no regard for some of the consequences. While they all claim they have safety nets and guardrails in place, multiple journalists, writers, and even other companies have proven that these AI engines can be tricked into disseminating false and dangerous information including instructions on making bombs and ghost guns.<br/><br/>This is why the US government needs to take a Michigan more aggressive approach in creating some regulations to guide the AI revolution. We are already very behind the proverbial 8 ball and anything we do now will need to be consistently revisited in order to establish a clear and effective way of regulating AI. The EU has taken this to heart and is working toward the first draft of AI guidelines making them the global leader. If the US wants to help lead, it would behoove the members of congress (who are not the most technologically savvy group of people) to come together and address this issue head on.<br/><br/>This is not a liberal or conservative ideology. This is not about the first amendment or wokeness and it has absolutely nothing to do with so-called cancel culture (a thing that does not really exist but that is for another forum).<br/><br/>Our inability to regulate AI has real life consequences. If unchecked it can lead to the impersonation of public figures with no ability to dostinguish between whats real and whats fake, it can lead to volumes upon volumes of wrong information being disseminated to the public. It can cause people to think officials are saying things they aren&#39;t and thus could lead to violence and catastrophic ends such as power grid failures and even the launch of weapons.<br/><br/>Beyond those more esoteric consequences, one need look no further than the current WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes to see how AI will lead directly the loss of jobs in the workforce. Beyond the actors and writers who remain out of work, thousands of carpenters, electricians, painters, sound technicians, and many others remain out of work with no ability to earn income and pay their bills. What the AMPTP is trying to do - utilize AI to create original content - has catastrophic consequences if allowed to remain unchecked.<br/><br/>Now is the time for action. Please take all necessary steps to create an AI regulation framework.
