I believe that allowing the use of AI in copyrighted work will degrade any worth in copyrighting a work to begin with. Functionally, all current AI is capable of is copying other work. It cannot, by design, come up with new and unique work, because it is not designed to. The algorithms and code used is designed to pull information from already created works and replicate it. That is all AI is and to claim that that work can be copyrighted is to claim that anybody can grab any other persons work, even if it already is protected by copyright, and claim it as their own. The fact that many AI art generators in particular are designed to remove signatures and watermarks should alone be cause for concern because it shows that a lack of care or respect for whether a work belongs to another is baked into the design of these programs. <br/>Even beyond AI being used to create the end product, corporations have already proved that they will use AI to underpayment and overwork their staff. Employees are already being asked to edit horribly pieced together writing for anything from news articles to movie scripts, which is frequently more difficult than writing it from scratch to begin with, and then being told they will not be paid nearly as much as if they had written it themselves because supposedly the AI did all the hard work. All the AI did and can ever do is steal work already done and try to &quot;recreate&quot; it without directly copying and pasting. In writing it is at best a predictive text machine, which anyone with a phone with autocorrect already knows predictive text is chancy at best and downright terrible at worst. <br/>AI work should be be disallowed from the creation of works that are intended to be protected by copyright because they are inherently, by very design, a copy with no provable author.
