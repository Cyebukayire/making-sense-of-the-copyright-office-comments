AI is taking away from the creativity and support of individual artists, writers, etc. It&#39;s that simple. Not only are people turning to AI art instead of supporting real artists (who have needs and deserve support, mind you), but people are also taking the works of writers and artists and submitting them INTO AI, essentially stealing their works to &quot;add more&quot; or change it to their liking to steal as use as their own. This needs to end immediately. We need to have restrictions on AI that protect individual creators so that they can get the financial support they need. AI will never top the raw emotion and hard work that real creators put into their work, and it&#39;s time for others to realize it.
