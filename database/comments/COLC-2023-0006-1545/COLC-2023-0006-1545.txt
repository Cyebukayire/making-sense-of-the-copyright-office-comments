Hello <br/><br/>Technology has hit the point where creatives like myself now compete with AI - artificial intelligence that has no family to feed, that put no years into honing its craft - AI is built by people, yes, but it&#39;s built by having material - the work of creators, like me, writers &amp; artists &amp; photographers fed into it - then goes on to &#39;create&#39;, often by copying entire elements from the creators, and it builds on that.<br/><br/>Art drives the world. There&#39;s passion, human emotion, human experience that has touched all of us, all of our lives.<br/><br/>The art matters. The work matters. The creators matters. Please don&#39;t pave the way for AI to nudge us out of the way. Our future sons &amp; daughters, your future sons &amp; daughters, their children, grandchildren, all deserve a future where music, art, literature, photography &amp; film thrives and that can&#39;t happen in the vacuum AI will create.<br/><br/>AI has its place, but it MUST be closely regulated, in creative spaces, tech, security, etc.<br/><br/>After all, SkyNet was just AI.
