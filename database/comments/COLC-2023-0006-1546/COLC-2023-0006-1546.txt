These bots were trained off of existing works. Works that, at the very least, have authorship copyright protection. At every single turn of internet technology, Artists have had to fend off theft of image. All the while, becoming increasingly required to have a visual portfolio online to find work. We take every step to protect our work, and then we find out that websites have been feeding our work into a grinder without notification or compensation for years.<br/><br/>If the developers wanted to train these bots, then they should have made a body of original art to do so. The fact that they did not and chose theft instead only underscores the battle artists face everyday. Everyone wants art, everyone knows making art is a difficult practiced skill, but no one wants to pay for art.<br/><br/>Allowing a copyright to something that is 100% stolen, regurgitated art, made for greedy corporate entities via algorithm is not the right move.<br/><br/>Protection of original human creations is this agency&#39;s purpose, and I hope this remains the goal.
