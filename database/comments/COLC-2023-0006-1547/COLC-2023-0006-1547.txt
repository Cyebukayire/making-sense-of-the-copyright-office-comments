I find the widespread use of AI writing very concerning, as they are stealing the words of human writers and claiming them to be uniquely arranged by an artificial intelligence which does not exist. The very name is misleading- these are not independent thinkers with individual experiences, thoughts, and ideas, they are instead glorified word generators that guess at the most likely words to come next.  They are disingenuous, plagiaristic, and untrustworthy machines that cannot hold a candle to human writers.
