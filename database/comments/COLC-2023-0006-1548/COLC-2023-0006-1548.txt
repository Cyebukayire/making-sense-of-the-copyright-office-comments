Keep AI out of creative industries. Point blank. They steal from other artists&#39; and their copyrighted material, NOBODY should be allowed to take some AI generated mush that&#39;s all stolen material, and then copyright it as their &quot;own&quot;. It&#39;s not theirs, they did not actually CREATE anything. We HAVE artists and writers. Start paying them well and then we can ALL start having nice things again. AI is going nowhere good--just put an end to it Please, for the love of Whatever you believe in.
