This is a timely and important issue to consider.  My opinion on the matter is that works coming from artificial intelligence, or generative AI, should not be copyrightable under any circumstances.<br/><br/>The use of a cognitive modeling system does not replace the essential factor of human creativity in the regulatory framework of copyrights.  Granting these systems copyright would flood the world with new copyrighted works, which would be unfair to human creators who simply could not keep up with that pace.<br/><br/>Conversely I also hold that these works, while not copyrightable, are not necessarily derivative of every image used to train the AI.  All artists, human or artificial, observe the products of other artists in the process of learning their trade.  It is how everyone learns.  In that sense all artists create derivative works. The fact that AI systems do it faster and with greater scope does not mean their works are derivative, this is a ridiculous claim.  Current copyright holders that make their works public must accept the fact that those works might be used in training.  The artist should have the option of disallowing their works&#39; inclusion in future training packages, however.<br/>
