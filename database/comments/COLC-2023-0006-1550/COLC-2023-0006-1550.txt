You can&#39;t copyright what is made on the back of other&#39;s stolen works. AI violates copyright to make it&#39;s stuff so thus AI artwork should not be able to be copyrighted. Also human thought is the whole reason behind copyright. If something is made with a computer doing all the work it shouldn&#39;t count cause there is no human in it. AI should just be used to help automate mundane processes or create a reference. Never should it be used as an equivalent to human creation.
