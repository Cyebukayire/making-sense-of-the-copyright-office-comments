I&#39;ll keep it simple. If my work goes into making someone else profit, in any way, shape or form, I want a cut.<br/>I can&#39;t just sell my own Iron Man comics, no matter how I package them. No one should be able to use my work without my knowledge, consent, and without fair exchange, for profit. <br/>Period. Simple. End of story.
