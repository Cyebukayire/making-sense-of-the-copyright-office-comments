-AI models should NOT be allowed to use copyrighted data in training!<br/>-AI generated material should NOT be copyrightable!<br/>-Anyone creating AI models should liable for anything they use to train their AI without getting EXPLICIT consent from the original author first! In other words- AI model creators should NOT be allowed to scrape whatever material they want from the internet to train their models with. Artists should have to explicitly opt-in or submit their work to the AI model in order for it to be used in training. No one should have to worry that THEIR material could be used to train AI models without their consent!!
