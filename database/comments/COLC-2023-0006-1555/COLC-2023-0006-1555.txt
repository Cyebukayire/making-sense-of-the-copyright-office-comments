In general, I don&#39;t think things created by AI should be copyrightable. The AIs currently available to use are scraping data and information from all over the internet, usually without the permission of various artists and people who post content online. To me, this is the equivalent of one person making a PowerPoint presentation and posting it online to share with others, and then another person copying the same presentation but putting the slides in a different order and claiming it&#39;s theirs. Some AI generated art barely changes the source material at all, to the point where it is an obvious bastardization of someone else&#39;s art. Allowing AI programs to copyright the things they produce will be detrimental not just to artists but to anyone whose intellectual property has been disseminated online. A lot of artists and creators aren&#39;t able to fully copyright every single thing they produce, and having to compete with massive generative AI systems is going to affect creative fields significantly. <br/><br/>On a more philosophical note, I think the idea that a machine can create art that is in any way comparable to art made by a human is simply devastating. What kind of world do we live in where machines and computers get to make art and tell stories and create songs and humans are forced to complete with them? I think AI can be beneficial for certain things such as data analysis and sometimes information gathering, but I truly believe art should be left to humans. The world is hard, and creativity is a difficult thing to pursue in a society that values productivity and profits more than anything. If we start automating art, of all things, I think the affects on society will be seen more sociological than anything. We will see people give up on creative pursuits, we will see creative industries shift from a human work force to an automated one, we will see people lose their jobs and their passions so a machine can take over instead. And if we allow them to copyright their generated material, it is just going to get worse. <br/><br/>If someone created a character and posted them online, and then an AI generates a picture with that character and then copyrights the image, does the original creator have the legal right to continue using the character that they created? Is this going to lead to lawsuits? Is this going to cause artists to fear posting anything online lest it be leached by a random generative AI that will produce a misshapen offspring of the source material? Never mind the way AI generated images contribute to the issue of misinformation all over the internet. A Google Images search for a painting or a type of bird or celebrity photo yields tons of results created by AI mixed into original photos and sources. How is anyone meant to sift through all of the AI nonsense to find the truth? <br/><br/>I found a couple articles regarding copyright and AI generated things. Here is one from Washington D.C. where the district court judge proclaims that &ldquo;human authorship is a bedrock requirement of copyright.&rdquo; https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/19/23838458/ai-generated-art-no-copyright-district-court<br/><br/>See also this article about small artists struggling to compete with AI generated content and how they have not been compensated for their work being used by AI. https://fortune.com/2023/08/31/artists-lawsuit-artificial-intelligence-companies-copyright/<br/><br/>I hope my words and the words of others make it clear that images and other works generated by AI cannot and should not be allowed to be copyrighted. This is not only a matter of making sure that (human) artists are fairly compensated and credited for their work, but also preventing machine learning and computers from completely taking over creative industries. <br/><br/>Thank you for reaching out to the public for this issue. <br/><br/>
