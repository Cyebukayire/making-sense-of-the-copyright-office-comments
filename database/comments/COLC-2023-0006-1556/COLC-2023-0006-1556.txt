I&#39;m worried about the use of AI in the arts, specifically where it can be used to eliminate jobs (such as rendering background extras in shows or using AI for first draft scripts and turning script writers into editors.) I&#39;m also worried about the use of AI to create the voices of celebrities and politicians, that could be used to spread misinformation and hate speech. There must be some protections in place for people&#39;s likenesses and livelihoods as AI usage becomes more prevalent.
