Works generated with artificial intelligence or other generative programs should not be eligible for copyright protection. The models and algorithms used to generate content are themselves using copyrighted material without permission of the copyright holder and should be treated accordingly: as automated art theft. If an individual steals a painting, that individual cannot copyright the painting as if he or she made it. Why should AI programs be the exception? Why should the programmers making these models be allowed to use copyrighted material without authorization? Why should they be allowed to copyright and sell the results? AI programs also do not produce anything of value. A person typing in a prompt to generate a short story should not be able to copyright that story, because that person did not write it. &ldquo;Artists&rdquo; and &ldquo;authors&rdquo; who use artificial intelligence did not create any intellectual property of their own. They created a cheap imitation of someone else&rsquo;s, and the copyright laws of the US should not dignify that behavior. Artificial intelligence has its uses, but it is not in producing works that fall under copyright.
