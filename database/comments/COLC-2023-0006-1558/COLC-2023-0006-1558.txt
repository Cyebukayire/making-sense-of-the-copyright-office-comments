How can a model that uses other people&#39;s creative works to generate other images with no original input be fair use? I don&#39;t think it can. I feel that the only way for AI to be considered ethical it must be trained with the full, revocable consent of the human people whose works/voices/likenesses were used to train it and the resulting works can&#39;t be copyrighted since little to no human input was given. Or, if the results are to be copyrighted, let them default to the true originators of the content: those whose works/voices/likenesses were supplied to train the AI.
