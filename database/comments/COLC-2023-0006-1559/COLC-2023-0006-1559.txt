AI generated images cannot be copyrighted if the AI generator has been trained on stolen (aka copyrighted) materials. If the owners of the copyrighted materials with which the AI was trained didn&rsquo;t give their consent, the AI is trained on stolen intellectual property, which makes it uncopyrightable. That&rsquo;s the problem with Midjourney and other AI generators that have been trained on stolen materials. Artists did not consent to their works being used, so how can someone &ldquo;create&rdquo; something by using materials they stole? It&rsquo;s not possible. <br/>Also, another point is that AI illustration generators cannot copyright the generated work because they did not create it. A machine did. The only way to prove they created something is to see if they can reproduce it again, with traditional means.
