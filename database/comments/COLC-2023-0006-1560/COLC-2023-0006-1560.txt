Artificial intelligence creates directly by copying things it sees, such as writing, art, photo&rsquo;s,&hellip; None of these things get the consent of the creators to be used in such a way. Which makes &lsquo;teaching&rsquo; AI&rsquo;s a case of plagiarism, because everything you see done by an AI has been taken directly from some of the things it has been shown to form a pattern, therefore stealing from other creators.
