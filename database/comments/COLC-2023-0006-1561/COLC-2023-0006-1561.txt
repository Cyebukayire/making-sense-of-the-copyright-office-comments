Artificial Intelligence is not making anything copywriteable. Even AI databases that were touted to be made of permissioned works have been shown to contain infringement (see complaints against Adobe Firefly).  Many popular prompts for AI include &quot;in the style of&quot; a specific artist, attempting to copy their creative impetus without paying the original artist. If the database that trained the AI has that artist&#39;s work without permission, and produces art in their style, the artist is left with questionable grounds for a lawsuit already, as well as the burden of proof that the database has their work, which would be prohibitively expensive to prove and press in court.<br/><br/>To make AI content suitably unique to be an independent work, human involvement is required. That human work is already being devalued (see the writers and actors strike complaints). AI is making artistic cardboard from the ground-up stolen art of people that were actually creative, and being used to make other creatives turn it into art with less recognition and pay. This isn&#39;t a new creative outlet, this is a tool to put down labor at the expense of a worse product. If the US allows for AI projects to be copyrightable, the market will be flooded with subpar product, with the expense forcing better creatives out of business.<br/><br/>Please do not allow this to come to pass. This is an issue about the independence of those who make art, and their ability to pay their bills. This is an issue about what art society values: Regurgitating worse but cheaper versions of the past, or requiring that new things be made with care? The choice is yours.
