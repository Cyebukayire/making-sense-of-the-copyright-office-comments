I&rsquo;m a marketing writer by profession, and I write fiction on the side to publish for free online. Generative AI like ChatGPT, while an amazing piece of software and a great tool as a writer, concerns me because writers can&rsquo;t opt out of having their work scraped or receive credit for their copyrighted work. I think AI can be a valuable tool, but I would like to see consent and credit be established in this sphere with regards to copyright. I love my writing and sharing it with others. AI presents a fundamental threat to not only writing but community. If writers don&rsquo;t feel safe to put their work online lest it be scraped without their knowledge or consent, I think the internet and the world as a whole would be a much less social, community-driven place. Please don&rsquo;t let that happen - establish guidelines that protect writers&rsquo; and artists&rsquo; intellectual property!
