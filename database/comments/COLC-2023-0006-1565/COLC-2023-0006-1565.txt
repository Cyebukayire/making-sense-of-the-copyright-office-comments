I am not an artist in any way just a regular citizen that enjoys art. I do not find the concept of AI/chat bots unethical in themselves, what I do find unethical and what should be regulated is how the databases of the AI are built. Regulations to stop them from using sweeps of the internet without the knowledge, consent, or monetary gain of the original owner are needed. These AI currently being built on the works of others for which there are currently no protection for.
