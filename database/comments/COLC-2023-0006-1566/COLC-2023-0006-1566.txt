Generative &ldquo;AI&rdquo; is a potentially disastrous source of misinformation and a threat to jobs everywhere. I strongly suggest the following be made into law, with steep penalties:<br/>- computer models must use ONLY source material from creators who have individually opted in (not automatically opted in via the fine print on a social media site etc)<br/>- all computer-generated text and images MUST be CLEARLY identified as such to avoid getting confused as misinformation<br/>- jobs cannot be replaced with computer models<br/>
