I do not believe AI generated works should be allowed to be copyrighted for the common sense reasons already used in an earlier ruling. They&#39;re not created by a human. The biggest issue with AI works as I see it in the moment are people that will use AI to generate works but then demand they should &quot;own&quot; it because they &quot;created it.&quot; In reality they didn&#39;t create anything at all, the algorithm did as they attempt to take credit and seek profit from something they didn&#39;t make. <br/><br/>Also take into consideration how AI accomplishes its creation. The AI has to be fed the works/images/sounds etc of preexisting works which are then re-imagined. The original artists get no credit or compensation from this by and large. It simply feels like granting AI works copyright protections is giving license to steal other artists&#39; works wholesale. Copyright law in America can be questionable at times but personally, I feel the ability to copyright a AI generated work is a step too far.
