I believe that any usage of AI is fundamentally theft, as it is scraped from thousands and millions of hours of labor that is being disrespected and muddied, and that that it violates both copyright law and the fundamentals of plagiarism. Finally, and this is especially true for for-profit uses of this technology, it violates fair use and makes an all around worse product.<br/>I feel very passionately about this subject and will always feel this way, there is no practical use for AI in art creation of any form.
