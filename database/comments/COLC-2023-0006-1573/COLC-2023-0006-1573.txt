Every single thing i have seen that uses OpenAi has a huge amount of stolen content in it. I have rarely seen a piece of media that does not have some form of plagiarism. There needs to be some regulation that OpenAi needs to go to the SOURCE of what they are feeding their AI&rsquo;s for permission to use this content in their training.
