AI language models are built on stolen, unauthorised human labour. It is only capable of rehashing &amp; remixing the data sets it is fed - because the data sets include unauthorized use of copyrighted material, it cannot &amp; should not be protected by copyright law.<br/><br/>At best, AI generated works are low quality bootlegs &amp; at worst, AI generated works are malicious abuse of copyright that have direct impacts on the true human writers &amp; artists.<br/><br/>There are already examples of AI generated books being sold online using real author&#39;s names without their authorisation, tarnishing the name of the real author by associating their name with low grade generated garbage.<br/><br/>However the AI debate isn&#39;t about the quality of the works - the quality will inevitably improve like most technologies. The issue is the language models (the very foundation of these AI text generators) is built on stolen work &amp; enhanced AI generators expand on the theft of copyright by harvesting eBooks, fan fiction websites, social media platforms, &amp; any other online resource they can pillage to further train their AI platforms.<br/><br/>Granting these algorithms any protection under copyright is to undermine the very function of copyright law - to protect the intellectual property rights of human creators.
