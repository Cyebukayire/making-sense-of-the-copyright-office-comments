AI are not human beings. They do not have creative output. Moreover, anything an AI creates is an amalgamation of other works as opposed to a new creation. Though humans tend to retell different versions of stories with new facets and take inspiration from other works that is not the same thing as smashing the existing work of others together and producing something that essentially just reorders those works without the consent of the original authors or artists. Those who prompt AI have not created something on their own and thus should not receive a copyright.
