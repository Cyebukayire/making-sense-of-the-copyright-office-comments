I am concerned about AI using human-authored works to train, and then being used to create works to supplant the human author or artist. It&#39;s already hard to have a career as a writer or artist; most of us work at some other job full-time and use our &quot;free time&quot; to write. The misuse of AI could make it even harder. I hope you will recognize the value of having humans produce writing, both for the writers and readers, and prevent AI from being able to &quot;steal&quot; from writers.
