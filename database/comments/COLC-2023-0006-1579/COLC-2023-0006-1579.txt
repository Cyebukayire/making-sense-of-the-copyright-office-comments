AI-created visual and written art should never be copyrightable, and furthermore, since AI is not actually anything except a really clever way to remix existing things that actual people have made, the people whose material was used to create the art that is used in a monetized product should be compensated for it.<br/>If it was any other business, taking someone&#39;s product, even a small part of it, and putting a color filter over it before monetizing it would be plagiarism or theft. The only difference between doing that, and running an AI art generation tool that generates the exact same thing because it&#39;s basing the art on someone else&#39;s product, is abstraction and an added layer of plausible deniability.<br/>If you want to monetize anything that uses AI-generated creative content, the database of art that was used as the foundation for the AI tool&#39;s ability to generate art should only contain pieces that are in the public domain or have been given freely or licensed by the artists. If people can sue someone over the usage of more than 4 bars of music that seems similar, then artists should be able to sue if they see their art, but wonkier because it was made with AI, in a monetized product.
