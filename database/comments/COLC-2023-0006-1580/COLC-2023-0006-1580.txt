I think that AI is stealing from artists, writers, musicians, voice actors, and any other people whose data is put into it, and it is dangerous. It plagiarizes other people&rsquo;s creative efforts in an attempt to &ldquo;create&rdquo; something that is actually a mishmash of other people&rsquo;s actual hard work. In the case of the AI the big studios want to use to scan actors&rsquo; likenesses and own them in perpetuity, it is stealing their likeness, their face, body, voice, which in some ways is the person themselves. AI is not actually &ldquo;intelligent,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s just a program that steals other people&rsquo;s hard work, mashes it together, and then claims it&rsquo;s made something new. Instead of AI, it should simply be called a plagiarism machine.
