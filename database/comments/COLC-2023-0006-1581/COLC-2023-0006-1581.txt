AI art, either pictures or writing, as it is now is theft. You can&#39;t grab a person&#39;s clothes or their car or painting and say it&#39;s yours now- that&#39;d be theft. So why are we allowing people to grab pictures or writing off the web and feed it into these softwares for their own profit? <br/>People are already seeing their lively hoods affected negatively because of AI. Writers are having bogus books with their names attached but they never wrote the book and don&#39;t see the profits of those sales, that&#39;s identity theft. Artists are finding their images, images that they spent hours to days creating, usurped by others who think that clicking a few buttons is the same as painting or drawing. Plus if we allow AI art be its own thing that brings questions into physical forgeries legitimacy, &quot;it looks like a Van Gogh and says it&#39;s a Van Gogh so it has to be a Van Gogh&quot;<br/>AI art doesn&#39;t create, it can&#39;t have a feeling in it&#39;s creation, because a computer doesn&#39;t have sentience. It&#39;s working off of stolen images because it doesn&#39;t truly create- it only make collages, collages that people are trying to pass off as completely original works from source material that was never given permission to be used and profited from<br/>
