I am incredibly concerned about how unregulated the use of AI is, and all the ways it is currently likely using existed copyrighted material to &ldquo;learn&rdquo;. I am also concerned about the products it creates, and the many news articles and opinions that have come out lately about the possibility of AI replacing writers, actors, and creators of many industries. It has the potential to destroy every creative field and eradicate jobs and wages for all the people who work in those fields. <br/>From an informational/factual standpoint, AI is often wrong in the information it presents as fact, which also raises several concerning questions about the ethics of allowing the use of AI to continue unchecked and without any regulations.
