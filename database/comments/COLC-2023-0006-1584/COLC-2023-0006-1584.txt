AI should NEVER be used for writing, idea generation, visual arts, or video and audio production. For one thing, AI is an algorithm that I can predict that, much like Google or YouTube algorithms, will reach a point where even their creators have no idea how they are pulling information. Even with AI regulations to only use copyrighted works, the likelihood of a large algorithm being abused for plagiarism purposes is extremely likely. So don&#39;t bother. <br/><br/>Also, these creative services make up the bulk of people&#39;s lives!! It is a talent and skill to learn how to edit film, and write marketing/sales copy, and DRAW. It is a kind of self-expression and social communication. Take that away, or take away the ability for people to tell what is human and what is AI, and we will lose our sense of humanity. Companies are already starting to use it in place of people. Imagine if an AI tool created all of the movies that inspired you. Would they be as inspirational? Would it mean as much in society?<br/><br/>AI can be used for data collecting tasks, maybe, or scheduling, but don&#39;t ever allow it to be in the arts.
