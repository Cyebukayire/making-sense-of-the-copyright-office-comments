The copywrightability of any given work is a quality meant to protect the original creator from various infringements on their creative freedom, and of these, none apply to AI<br/>1a) Most public AI is trained on data not consensually given by that data&rsquo;s creators; given the mechanical nature of AI, this therefore leaves the distinct, although admittedly quite rare, possibility of it simply copying one of the pieces it was trained on ~100%.  Thus, by its very nature, AI can &amp; will infringe copyright in select moments.<br/>1b) Most AI tools, esp. AI art tools, have been used to &mdash;with the encouragement by several high profile users of these tools&mdash; copy an artist&rsquo;s &lsquo;style&rsquo;.  This style-copying is different from when done by a human, because when done so, the purpose is for most cases the appreciation of the style, yet whenever an AI is used to do so it is for the express purpose of supplanting the original artist to get &lsquo;free art&rsquo;; artistic style is most often copied in the creation of fan art, to give the fan art the same &lsquo;feel&rsquo; as the proper creator&rsquo;s art (it should be noted too that in this case fan-artists also retain stylings personal to them even pursuing imitating a certain style), while AI programs often just allow users to type in &ldquo;in the style of X&rdquo; to prompt the model into copying the style &mdash;there is no dedicated effort to learning how to mimic the style, and there is no care put behind the effort regardless.  As such, the only functional purpose that AI style-copying can serve is to supplant many artists from their ability to survive off of their art (already a difficult task) by giving people an extremely cheap alternative that can not only rip off their work effortlessly, but also produce work at an uncompetitive rate.<br/>1c) For dead artists (ie Leonardo DaVinci, Van Gogh, Monet, etc.) I would simply say that in copying their styles with AI, it would betray both a fundamental artistic illiteracy and disrespect for the artist by the user of the AI.<br/>2) On visibility of training datasets: All AI models pre-trained that are either public or are being exchanged for (entirely sold, leased out, rate payment for access, etc.) should have their datasets be made public &amp; easily available for inquiry.  Personal AI models should only have datasets made public under significant suspicion of violating law (copyright or other).  There is simply no good reason to not do so.<br/>3) On the legal status of AI generated works: As AI works are not generated by a/multiple consciousness(es), in accordance with the statement on Jan 28 2021 by the United States Copyright Office, they do not constitute intentional work, much less &lsquo;art&rsquo;: &ldquo;The U.S. Copyright Office will register an original work of authorship, provided that the work was created by a human being.  The copyright law only protects &lsquo;the fruits of intellectual labor&rsquo; that &lsquo;are founded in the creative powers of the mind.&rsquo; Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82, 94 (1879). Because copyright law is limited to &lsquo;original intellectual conceptions of the author,&rsquo; the Office will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not create the work.&rdquo;  This is a fair decision to maintain because AI has not (yet) reached the point where it could even display the level of conscious thought exhibited by simpler mammals (ie rodents, lagomorphs, etc.) and therefore in the creation of its works, AI cannot communicate ideas to a potential audience, a fundamental core of what makes art art.<br/>In summary, I believe that AI models should be disallowed from using personal &amp; private data not consensually provided; that their datasets should be public if they are public use, having value exchanged for their use, or are under significant suspicion of being used to facilitate law infractions; and that AI works be considered non-copyrightable on account of the fact of their lack of consciousness.<br/>Thank You.
