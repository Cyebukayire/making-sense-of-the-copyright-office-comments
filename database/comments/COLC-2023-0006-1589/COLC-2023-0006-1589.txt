The current &quot;AI&quot; trend is an attack on artists of all kinds and should not be given as much free reign as it has been. For months, developers have been scraping artists&#39; work to use for &quot;AI&quot; training without notification or permission. Corporations have taken this as blanket permission to begin doing the same thing to any and all of their users regardless of what they&#39;re using the service for. It has gotten to the point that these corporations are trying to replace human authors with &quot;AI&quot; bots in Hollywood to save a few fraction of a penny! This has to be nipped in the bud, art is created by the artist who deserves to be payed for their labor. All &quot;AI&quot; produced content is created by stealing from someone else and should NEVER be allowed to be copywrited.
