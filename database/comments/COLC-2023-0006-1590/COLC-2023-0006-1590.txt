My name is Eva Toorenent, and I am a Dutch freelance artist and illustrator. I work in various mediums like acrylics, oils, digital painting, sculpting, and watercolor.<br/><br/>As a creative freelancer, I have multiple income streams: galleries, courses, concept art, books, tarot cards, selling of art prints, etc (almost all international). And I am here to tell you that every single income source of mine is currently affected by this Generative AI technology. Even traditional art is not safe. Ai &quot;art&quot; has infiltrated every branch of our creative industry. It is replacing us creatives/copyright holders with our own labor.<br/><br/>Copyright protections are there to protect creatives from competing against their own work. How is it possible that millions of creatives and copyright-holders are currently competing with their own work?<br/><br/>I am writing a comment today because the Copyright Office is one of the few institutions that can make a difference for creatives (and has in the past; thank you for that). This is why I want to ask you today to strengthen copyright protection and make new guidelines regarding Generative AI. One of those guidelines should be: Without the copyright holder&#39;s explicit consent, our work should not be used to train Generative AI. If our work is used without our permission, it should be considered copyright infringement by the AI company and user. (Note: vague Terms and conditions by mega-tech corporations should not be sufficient as explicit consent.)<br/><br/>My style, art, and passion that I have spent a lifetime cultivating and growing have been taken without my consent by companies, scientists, and endless individuals. I am not the only one. We can stop this, but we can&#39;t do it alone. You are one of the few entities that can actively help us. <br/><br/>Remember, without us creatives, this tech would not exist. Since this tech depends entirely on us, we should have more say and power over what happens to our work. <br/>
