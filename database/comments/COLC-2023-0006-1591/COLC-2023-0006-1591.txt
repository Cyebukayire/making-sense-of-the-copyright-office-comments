I am a moderator of /r/camphalfblood on Reddit. The mod team two years ago decided to ban the use of AI in text and in art submissions due to the AI software infringing on the intellectual creations that small artists and fanfic writers have created using their own efforts sans AI. <br/><br/>AI is not just a threat to major industry professionals in Hollywood. It is also infringing on the copyrights of everyday artists and writers who create art as a hobby. These creatives, some of whom are children,  rely on engagement to foster their talents and perhaps one day become part of the working community of artists.<br/><br/>AI softwares need to be investigated for copyright infringement
