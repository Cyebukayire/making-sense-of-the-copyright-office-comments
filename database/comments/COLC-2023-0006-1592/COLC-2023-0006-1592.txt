I have deep concerns about the copyright issues raised by AI. I simply don&#39;t see any possible way that anyone could claim copyright over AI-generated work when A) they did not create it B) the tool they used, in almost every case, scraped samples from unconsenting creators. Because of this, I think that allowing for copyrighting of work created with AI is just not honest, and allowing it wouldnset a terrible precedent that goes against the spirit and intent of the practice.
