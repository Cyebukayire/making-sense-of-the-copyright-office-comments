The usage of AI to create new content violates the copyright and intellectual property rights of individuals by scraping the information, whether that be the written or spoken word or direct art format and styles of an individual, in an incredibly twisted manner. Most AI machines are trained on the input of thousands if not millions of works and most of the time, the original creator or copyright holder never granted consent or permission for this AI to utilize their content. There is AI being trained on an author&#39;s work to create a book, then that book is published to Amazon under that author&#39;s name but the author is not getting profit from the book, the person who stole their name and content to generate an AI book is. If given the chance, AI can and will utilize and steal everything that it is capable of in order to generate content based on those ideas. AI for the creation of content should not be permitted under current copyright unless the individuals who made the AI are able to prove without a shadow of a doubt that it was trained on content those individuals created or were given consent to feed it.
