Any AI use of copyrighted material without permission should constitute a violation of copyright, the same way other programs or entities would not be allowed to directly use others work to create uncredited &ldquo;original&rdquo; content without permission.<br/><br/>In addition, as AI programs are not individuals or even persons, AI work should not ever be able to be copyrighted.  They are compilations of statistics based on others work, not original creations.
