If they want to use my copyrighted material with my consent, they can pay me for that use. That&#39;s literally what copyright was intended to do.<br/><br/>If they choose not to negotiate, they can pay me in shares of their company, as outlined in the steganographic text embedded in all of my works. Much like their terms and conditions documents, use of the material without other prior agreements indicates acceptance of all terms.
