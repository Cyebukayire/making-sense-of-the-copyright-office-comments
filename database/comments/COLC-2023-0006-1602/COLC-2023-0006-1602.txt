Artificial Intelligence (AI) as it is known should not be allowed copyright protection. AI relies on theft of copyrighted and trademarked materials in order to function, and to allow protection of that theft goes against the entire purpose of copyright law. Furthermore, there is no human creativity or expression attached to any piece of AI &quot;work.&quot; A machine is not a person and its byproducts, supposedly devoid of human intervention, cannot have the same legal protections as a person. Our creativity is what makes us unique, which the law recognizes and protects. AI should be monitored and should not, under any circumstances, be allowed copyright protection.
