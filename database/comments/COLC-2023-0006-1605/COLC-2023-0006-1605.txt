I believe that artificial intelligence should not be used to create art if the original artwork used to train the artificial intelligence is obtained illegally or without the explicit concent of the creator of the original artwork. <br/>I also believe that the same can be said for writing. Artificial intelligence should not be used to create writing that is trained by writing of another person unless obtained legally or with the explicit permission of the original creator of the writing.<br/>Lastly, I do not believe that art or writing produced by artificial intelligence should be produced under the guise ofnit being created by a human and not artificial intelligence.
