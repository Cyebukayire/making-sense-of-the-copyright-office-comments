AI art and writing can never be real. Stories, songs, drawings and paintings, these things come from human emotion. No computer could ever make something that could be considered art because computers do not have feelings. When an artist creates something, it has meaning. Computers cannot assign meaning to anything because they are not alive. Any &quot;art&quot; created by an algorithm should be considered counterfeit. There&#39;s not a single engine that hasn&#39;t been trained on stolen images and words. It&#39;s plagiarism and it needs to be stopped. AI cannot be allowed to take jobs from real<br/>artists. It&#39;s a power and money grab by corporations and it cannot be allowed to continue. Art has value, artists have value. AI &quot;art&quot; is fake and meaningless.
