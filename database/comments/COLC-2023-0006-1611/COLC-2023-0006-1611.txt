I&#39;m an author who has self-published 18 books (in addition to having traditionally published 37 more books also available in ebook format) and I believe at least two of my books have been scraped off of Smashwords and fed into an AI generator to help &#39;train&#39; it so it can better &#39;reply&#39; to prompts people who want to call themselves writers without doing any actual writing. I was not notified that my books were being downloaded for this purpose or uploaded into an AI generator. I was not offered the opportunity to opt out of this process. These books--my intellectual property that is copyrighted--were stolen from me. My unique ability to craft a turn of phrase, beats, pacing--all have been fed into what amounts to a huge copy-paste machine for other people to steal from, with no royalties paid to me for this usage, so that the not-writers can then in turn post this machine-copied word assembled from my work and countless other authors&#39; works up on Amazon in the hopes of making a quick buck. The digital book sales markets and short story markets have been flooded with AI generated works that are ungainly Frankenstein monsters of incoherent thoughts and ideas lifted from countless uncredited, unpaid authors like myself. A few people who tout these Artificial Intelligence generators have, after being called on their thefts of intellectual property, offered to remove works from the AI, but that&#39;s as easily done as putting smoke back in a cigarette. Offering to undo the theft of intellectual property that is copyrighted without making financial restitution  for the theft is not any kind of restitution. AI is not creative and it is not creation. It is theft of human creativity and a regurgitation of stolen ideas and it&#39;s very clear from reading anything AI generated that&#39;s longer than a few pages that whatever the AI turns out is often completely incoherent. AI may have many valuable uses but it has no place replacing human creativity and the so called &#39;works&#39; AI generates do not qualify for legal protections.
