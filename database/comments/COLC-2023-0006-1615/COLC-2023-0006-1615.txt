AI generated material should not be eligible for copyright. AI is not capable of unique thoughts and outputs. AI trains on the material of people and it&#39;s outputs are an amalgam of the exact material it trained on. When a person creates something eligible for copyright, they may use the material of other people as reference but they do not copy that material. Because AI essentially copies the work of others, the material it creates should not be copywritable.
