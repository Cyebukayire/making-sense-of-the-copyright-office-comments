Just understand any regulations regarding AI will turn into a hobble for the US&#39;s competition among other nations who will not be regulating. Its a bit like discussing how you want to hamper the progress of the automobile so other countries can do it far more effectively. Basic regulations is fine, protect privacy and no use for harm, but otherwise, you really need to keep this self regulated by the industries. privacy and without activities that could harm others is all thats needed here. Understand the science here though. We don&#39;t know fully how transformers work but we know it does, having a condition to explain it is like explaining quantum physics...again, not fully sure but it works enough to run applications.
