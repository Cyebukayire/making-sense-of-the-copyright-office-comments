hello! thank you for taking the time to do this. i do not support the use of AI to fill in writing, or replace the use of illustrators. i find the use of them to be rather lazy, and know that it has taken away opportunities from actual writers and creatives <br/>Also, there has been instances recently of people using AI to create fake foraging and wildlife guides-which create extreamely dangerous situations.
