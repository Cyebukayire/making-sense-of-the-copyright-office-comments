I am a 3D artist who has worked in Film, Games (Electronic arts) and Industry (Self driving cars, Apple, Applied Intuition etc.)<br/>And as Such I am conflicted, I feel for artists, however I am also intrigued by the promise of what some of this technology can do in the future.<br/><br/>for context I specialize in pushing forward technology, and 10 years ago I created some new technology to create games much more efficiently,<br/>tools to generate cities in a controllable way, 1000x more quickly then before. and the same &quot;fear based&quot; comments were around back then too.<br/>&quot;you&#39;re stealing my job&quot;.<br/>Now in this case it was popularizing and productioninzing procedural content generation, and people were afraid, however now merely 10 years later people would call you mad for manually trying to place thousands of trees, or millions of tufts of a grass in a game. its just the way to do things now.<br/><br/>similarly:<br/>- portrait artists likely protested against the Photocamera.<br/>- Stop motion artists were likely against 3D animation<br/>- Matte painters were put out of work due to Photoshop.<br/><br/>my point is change is natural, infact its required for progress.<br/><br/>AI is a very interesting technology, and like any technology will have good and bad impacts.<br/>but its still very early, and to curtail its uses now could create major issues.<br/>also if AI is banned in the US for example, the work will just shift to a place that did not ban it.<br/><br/>Ultimately as with all technology, rules likely need to be created to curtail the issues, while enabling fair uses.<br/>I hope people will consider the benefits, and not just reason from a position of fear out of losing their job.<br/>yes some artists will suffer, and yes they deserve some help to transition.<br/><br/>but we should not completely put a stop to a powerful technology and let the world pass us by.<br/>
