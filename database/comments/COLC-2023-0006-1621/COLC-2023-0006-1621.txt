I am a regular citizen with no special connection to the industries AI impacts, but I can say from personal experience the prevalence of low quality AI-generated media has made it significantly more difficult to use the internet. Too many articles written by an AI that contains obviously false information are clogging up my Google search results, no matter what I try to do to get rid of them. I also fear that AI technology will be used to replace creative in major industries like filmmaking or video game development. I think the US&#39;s arts industries are some of the best things we have going for us, and I don&#39;t want to see that ruined, both for the consumer due to AI made media just being pretty bad and for the creative being put out of a job, so that some already-wealthy executives can make even more money. For these reasons, I do not believe that AI-produced content should be protected by copyright law, as giving it that protection will only encourage the production of internet content sludge and the degradation of America&#39;s arts.
