First of all, thank you for taking the time to hear what people have to say about this. It means a great deal to a lot of writers and is a wonderful thing to see.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s wonderful because an average writer&rsquo;s ability to protect and use their own work is being threatened in a way that we&rsquo;ve only gotten glimpses of up until now. With the rise of e-books, authors had no choice but to accept that there would be digital copies of their work floating around the Internet. To refuse to publish digitally was not an option, and so we saw the rise of a certain kind of piracy. <br/><br/>Obviously, this was very aggravating and cut into authors&rsquo; ability to profit off their own work. But many pirates turned out to be amateurish and greedy, and as imperfect as the Amazon reporting system has been, their work could eventually be uncovered and forcibly taken down.<br/><br/>AI is a completely different animal. It&rsquo;s not a group of pirates violating a single author&rsquo;s copyright to make a few bucks. It&rsquo;s a group of corporations violating multiple authors&rsquo; copyrights to make millions. That they can get away with this type of undertaking is staggering,  as it represents an enormous threat to the copyright protection system, and weakens our ability to protect our intellectual property on a scale that we&rsquo;ve never encountered before.<br/><br/>With the advent of AI, authors aren&rsquo;t just being exploited by sloppy PDF producers in a bedroom somewhere. They&rsquo;re being exploited by companies that can breach multiple copyrights in one scrape. And this time, there&rsquo;s not even a crappy reporting system around to possibly help us.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important for the U.S. Copyright Office to step in and protect all authors&rsquo; copyright from this type of widespread threat. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s going to fall on the more successful writers to lodge lawsuits in an attempt to protect the rest of us. And writing being the precarious career that it is, that&rsquo;s asking an awful lot of a very select few.<br/><br/>Which is why we need your help. Because we&rsquo;ve accepted that putting their work on the Internet is a risk all authors have to face. <br/><br/>But to force us to face a foe like this in order to make a living?<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s not just immoral. It&rsquo;s practically the textbook definition of unfair.<br/><br/>
