The topic of AI using copyrighted materials for training overlaps with how humans learn from our environment. Generative AI&#39;s creation of media also overlaps with the conceptualization phase of human creation. Banning or restricting such methods would inevitably run into consistency issues, particularly as medical technology advances on a neurological front. As similar technologies are integrated into devices to assist with cases of brain injury, as well as more exotic technologies under development (such as exocortexes).<br/><br/>Any ban or restriction placed on AI, but not on humans, using this type of information processing will generate severe human rights issues (such as targeting the disabled who use assistive technologies) and require revising in the medium term. Delineating &quot;human&quot; and &quot;non-human&quot; creations will not be effective in even the short term, as AI diversifies and becomes more and more integrated in modern creative tools.<br/><br/>In summary, any regulation placed on AI will have to take into account that the methods the latest generation of AI use to train on and generate media are so similar to biological processes as to be indistinguishable with our current understanding. Regulating the processes themselves would result in human beings subjected to such regulation in the medium term, and regulating the entities creating media will both fail in the short term and likely be reviled by history in the long term.
