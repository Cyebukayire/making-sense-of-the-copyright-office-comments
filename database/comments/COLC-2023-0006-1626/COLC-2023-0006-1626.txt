If the results of computer algorithms are transformative, then they should not be deemed as infringing on copyright, regardless of the means in which they are produced. That is the law of the land, and changing this would open a Pandora&rsquo;s box of issues and restrictions on all art creation.<br/><br/>What was once simple prompt writing is now a highly specialized skill. People are training their own models and wiring complex software solutions with advanced user interface programs.<br/><br/>The skills someone brings as a creative director, still apply. Working with ai to get solid output is definitely hard work and should be something we can copyright. Good images and stories take solid demonstrable human effort.<br/><br/>AI images and writing isn&rsquo;t stealing. These computer algorithms reach into the full depth of human creativity and produce transformative works that have little to do with the training data. <br/><br/>This is the future, and if we want to compete on the global marketplace, we need to not restrict, but enable a new generation of artists.<br/><br/>
