I am an award-winning Canadian author and former journalist who was published in numerous trade and mainstream US magazines and books. I also studied AI as a psychology undergrad in 1994, creating my own AI-based software to detect viruses as I immediately understood the mechanisms. I am also an artist and educator. I am intimately familiar with multiple facets of AI from various standpoints. I am giving a warning about the parasitic nature of AI, which is, at heart, bigoted plagiarism-based software.<br/>I will give a few points as to the problems with AI, but these are not all of the issues. Creative talent has been under attack by the robber barons of Big Tech for decades who have, until now, controlled the narrative by reducing artists, authors, writers, journalists, singers, actors, musicians, and directors to a single dehumanized word: content producer. This disrespectful use of the word content is deliberate as it allows those robber barons to plunder from those who create the sole reason why people flock to the Internet in the first place, yet the creatives have no say or compensation for their work.<br/>And now these same unimaginative robber barons think nothing of stealing &ldquo;content&rdquo; so that they do not have to pay creatives while spitting in their faces at the same time.<br/>It is an unequal fight as these robber barons misuse PR firms and misuse lobbyists to rig laws to their benefit. It is a violation of my emotional rights and my right to earn a sustainable living based on my various talents and expertise.<br/>The problems with plagiarism-based software are numerous; however, once upon a time, technology was ahead of the law, but not with AI. Television shows, for instance, cannot steal content: they must get permission and pay for copyrighted work and such material goes through numerous software: from Zoom to Microsoft Word to email to various editing and broadcasting software. The law here is already established and it is clear.<br/>There are many reasons why AI is destructive and no better than Napster, which was shut down for doing the very same things AI-based software does.<br/>I will go over a few reasons:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;think&rdquo;: it can only take words, ideas, sounds, and images from a human. This is the very definition of copyright violation.<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>As the ones who produced the original material did not sign any contract or agree to have their works used, especially not for commercial purposes, this is a clear case of theft that is no different from a company trying to hack their way into a company&rsquo;s software without agreeing to the Terms of Service or pay for a licensing agreement.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Because there is no contract, the AI-based companies are violating an artist or author&rsquo;s moral rights. For example, I am a passionate advocate of racial equality and justice; however, with AI, which is a bigoted-based software, my words can be twisted to support racist causes, thus traumatizing me and violating my moral rights.<br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Even to &ldquo;train&rdquo; software without notifying or compensating the creator for commercial use is a violation of the copyright act. Just as an educator must obtain the rights to show a movie to students in a classroom, even for teaching purposes, these companies must be held to the same strict standards.<br/>5.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI-based companies openly crow in mainstream publications that women and minorities will lose their jobs the most with AI, meaning this software is a Trojan horse to violating anti-racism and sexism laws.<br/>AI will be a catastrophic economic blow to the global economy as regular citizens who do not understand the true nature of AI&rsquo;s algorithms will invest too much in it. Big Tech has not had any ground-breaking innovations, and hence, is now using AI as a narrative to hide the true state of its house of cards. They use lobbyists and PR firms to present a narrative misaligned with reality. As someone who is a researcher, I have done my homework and can see this is another attempt to keep up an inflated lifestyle at someone else&rsquo;s expense. I will not allow my work to be used without my permission: I have even asked the Internet Library to remove three of my books because (1) I received no compensation or was even asked permission, and (2) they have no mechanisms in place to protect works from being used by these content pirates.<br/>More telling is that recently, one judge ruled against giving copyright protection to AI-based work because it was not generated by a person. The judge was correct in her assessment but forgot two important points: (1) You cannot copyright stolen work, and (2) the very companies stealing other people&rsquo;s work were quick to demand to copyright it themselves. This incident says it all: we will steal from you and make you homeless, but we&rsquo;ll get rich on your hard work and protect our copyrights at all costs.
