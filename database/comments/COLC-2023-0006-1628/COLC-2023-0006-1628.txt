I have a written short fiction personal project that took me 34 consecutive days to finish, including searching for reference material to complete the short story. With current use of generative AI, if I put this short story online with the intent to share or even sell via Patreon, the work I put into this can be fed into a data set without my consent or even knowledge and then regurgitated using vague word prompts. Many writers and artists in my own social circles have responded to AI scraping by locking down their artwork. Things that were previously free with the understanding their work would be appreciated within the context of host websites such as Wattpad or Ao3 are now being pulled. If our work was used to train a data set, we have no recourse unless we are among the few who published with a copyright. Generative AI needs to require opt-in.
