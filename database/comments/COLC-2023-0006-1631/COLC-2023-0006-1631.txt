Per the Constitution the purpose of copyright is &quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;<br/><br/>On the topic of progress. Generative AI provides no progress. As a necessity of it&#39;s own construction it can only rehash what came before. It can not reach or imagine beyond the inputs provided. <br/>There is an argument to be made that generative AI is actually regressive as, the function of the models is to find an &quot;average&quot; of the inputs. But progress is not discovered or achieved through averages. Progress is by its very nature and outlier to what came before. <br/>Generative AI does not satisfy the purpose of copyright and so, should not qualify for its protections.<br/><br/>To the subject of author/inventor we must ask who is, in the case of generative AI output the author/inventor? Is it the prompt writer? No, the prompt writer performs no work or craft in the actual creation of the output. It doesn&#39;t matter how complicated your Starbucks order is, that doesn&#39;t not grant you copyright over the produced drink. Is it the algorithm? No a machine can not claim copyright and neither does the copyright belong to the maker of the algorithm. Just as in the Starbucks situation you wouldn&#39;t give the maker of the espresso machine copyright over the drink. <br/><br/>
