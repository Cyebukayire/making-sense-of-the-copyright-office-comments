As an independent artist and illustrator, I have seen first hand how AI has been used to degrade the years of skill and training of creatives. It mashes together existing artwork in order to mimic specific styles, from things as vague as &quot;marvel&quot; or &quot;anime&quot;, to much more specific &quot;the style of Loiosh&quot;, a popular digital illustrator. This is a dangerous precedence, where passion and creativity is being rendered down to typing a few key words into a generator. The fact that you can replicate an existing artist&#39;s work by using those keywords should be enough of a tell: this is not about furthering the creative arts. <br/><br/>The whole concept has felt like a slap in the face to artists, especially digital artists who create everything by sketching, inking, coloring, from scratch. Sure we have a few short cuts like the Magic Wand or Fill tool, and yes there are even custom brushes we use to make certain effects quickly, but the fact is WE MADE IT. We didn&#39;t feed it to an AI and tell it what to give us and then tweak the results. Our minds did it. Our hands made it. A human being had an idea and used the skills they possessed to created it.For years digital art was vilified as &quot;not real artwork&quot; or &quot;cheating&quot; and digital artists had to work HARD to correct the stigma. Now AI comes in, starts taking other peoples work, and generating pieces that are definitely stunning, but not REAL. Not in the sense that matters. Couple that with the fact that AI art generators are using artwork without original artist&#39;s permission to make this work and it becomes a million times worse.<br/><br/>Is AI interesting? Yes. Does it open a whole new arena for artistry? Sure! Should it be treated as comparable to traditional or digital illustrators? ABSOLUETELY NOT.  It&#39;s not the same. It never will be. And the AI apologists who have knowingly and callously ripped off the artwork of others have become a new level of art thief, stealing not just a single piece of work, but an artist&#39;s whole style.<br/><br/>Simply put: AI generated images are NOT art. They are an aggregate of data made from prompts. It will never be the same as slaving over a concept and executing it from thought, to sketch, to final piece. AI generated work can&#39;t replace years of crafting an artistic style, studying anatomy, lighting, color, composition, etc. AI generated work is making it harder for real artists to be taken seriously and to be paid fairly. Why value something custom when you can get a half-decent derivative from an AI? What does that mean for us who wish to make a living from our work? The sudden push of AI generated artwork feels like a complete and utter disrespect to artists and our cultural value. Unless you can prove that an AI is ethically sourced and the art used to teach it is used with permission and compensation, no one should be adding this as an option to any software.<br/><br/>AI generated work should not be eligible for copyright, and it should never be compared to a work where a human mind and human hands created something start to finish, whether it was with paints or a tablet pen. There are no adequate regulations to protect artists who have been unwillingly (or unknowingly) added to AI datasets, and big name AI generators such as Midjourney have already proven their unwillingness to ensure the legality of their datasets and protect creatives who have evidence of their own work and style being violated.
