AI artwork is just another step in the long line of derivative art and should be protected by copyright. <br/><br/>I, personally, have commissioned people who use AI to make visual artwork three separate times because I was fond of the style they cultivated using the AI program. The argument for what constitutes &quot;real art&quot; is constant; even at the turn of the century there were traditional artists arguing that digital art (make with the aid of a tablet or computer) shouldn&rsquo;t count as &ldquo;real&rdquo; art. After all, digital artists didn&rsquo;t have to mix colors, or struggle with symmetry; they could eyedrop the shade they wanted, or flip the digital canvas, or ctrl-Z any mistakes. Though, over time, those argument faded away and digital art was recognized as a medium in its own right.<br/><br/>In addition to being a good entry point for new artists, AI is also great for accessibility. It always disabled artists and those without use of their hands to create artwork.<br/>
