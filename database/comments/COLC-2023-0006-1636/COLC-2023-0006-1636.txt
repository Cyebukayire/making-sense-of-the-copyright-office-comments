As an artistic person with many friends who rely on art to make a living, I&#39;m extremely concerned about what will happen if there are not rules and regulations set in place for how AI is trained and used. I believe it is incredibly unethical for AIs to be trained on the art or voice of human artists without their knowledge or consent. Giving ai the ability to copy artists will badly impact their ability to make a living. Art is one of the most human things about us,, giving robots the same creative rights as the human creators they have stolen from is wrong. Allowing AI to be programmed with peoples work without consent or compensation is wrong. Further, particularly with AI use of peoples voices, it can and will be used maliciously to make it look as though someone has said or done something that they haven&#39;t. There needs to be some way of marking AI art, writing and voices so that people can tell what is real and what is an AI fake, as well as regulating which works AI can be trained on and how the ai work is used. AI should not be allowed to replace human artists, musicians, writers - these people are underpaid and underappreciated already, and deserve protection from AI theft.
