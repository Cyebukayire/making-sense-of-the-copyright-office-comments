AI technology have been very useful to remove unimportant, but needed task from my job. My effiency have been improved as a result. <br/>I believe that removing or stopping the raise of AI technology will not only let a good opportunity to improve many task and remove dullness in work, but also quite impossible to prevent. All around the globe, many country have company and researchers working on AI. If we stop now, another country will just sell it service here instead.
