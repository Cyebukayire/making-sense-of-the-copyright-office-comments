I firmly believe that AI rights should be be allowed to be copyrighted and that it should be illegal to train an AI on works the person does not own. AI in no way can truly replicate what humans do and pretending it can devalues art in every way. It also actively harms the people that AI is being trained on and I know the vast majority of people would not consent to having their work being used to train AI. There is a huge difference between something like an AI being trained on someone&rsquo;s art and being used to replicate it and another person trying to replicate a style or piece of art. AI poses a huge risk to copyright.
