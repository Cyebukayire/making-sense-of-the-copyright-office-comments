We have many professional works that have long explored the consequences and immorality of artificial intelligence, all with the agreement that humanity has never needed it, and we never will.<br/><br/>That said, human artists come first, always. AI images, audio, and texts absolutely should NOT be eligible for copyright in any way.<br/>They are stolen without consent and stripped to produce quick and cheap soulless products for those too greedy to invest in the real arts--the very process of creation that makes us human in the first place.<br/><br/>It must be required by law to state publicly and obviously when a work is created using prompts from a machine, with non the source material allowed to come from human creatures without their explicit consent.<br/><br/>The current programs that have already scraped the internet to illegally steal the art, voices, likeness, and words of humans must be erased and start over a blank slate to gather their resources legally and humanely.<br/><br/>Humans first. Please protect the ancient traditions and livelihood of artists in a way our ancestors would be proud of.
