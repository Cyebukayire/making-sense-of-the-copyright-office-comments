As far the use of AI related content, the content should be allowed as it is generated by AI sourcing the public data. If people has allowed to read any of their data publially which should mean the AI or any other bot is allowed to use and generate based on that content too. <br/>There should be no issues into this as the data is public and accessible to google as well. IF anything which is not allowed to be read by any person without permission that source of data should be banned and cannot be generated by the AI.<br/><br/>Other than that the content which is based on multiple articles and AI just re-written based on their algorithms, and tweaked the content as per the prompts passed should also be monitored and removed if not allowed.
