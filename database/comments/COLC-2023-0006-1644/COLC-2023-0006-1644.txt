AI is, on a good day, a slippery slope, combining enhanced research in areas like health, with the blatant monetary grab for the total creative history of humanity without compensation.  Recombined knowledge should never replace original work, either in school or on the canvas.  Just because you CAN do something, does not mean you SHOULD.  Fierce rules need to be put into place to clearly identify AI images (ALL with a specific watermark) to generated content based on a body of literature from an author, the work NOT generated BY that author.  The fines should be ENORMOUS.  Studios should NOT be allowed to to capture images of actors and then re-create them through AI in order not to have to pay them when used in other scenes, or other movies.  The central cancer today is GREED, and that greed preys upon any alley left unguarded that could produce money, or save the perpetrator money.  We have to attribute, through quotes and source material, anything we write.  AI should not be allowed to steal content, any content, or images, and then recombine them and pretend it is new.  You think the economy is cock-eyed now?  Wait until AI guts major industries for greed/profit, producing what will become mediocre re-cycled content adding nothing to the human dialogue, or wonder.  Gut the creative side of humanity, and destroy the wonder and awe. Steal people&#39;s images, and encroach on privacy that the google-world has begun, except that the result will be rape.  Why is there any doubt that this MUST be HIGHLY regulated, with watermarks and attribution, and original credit and financial compensation.  Ask yourself a seminal question - what the HELL are your children and grandchildren going to do for a living when AI takes over.  And remember, AI is run by money-people who, if they had the ability, would be creatives, and not plagiarists.
