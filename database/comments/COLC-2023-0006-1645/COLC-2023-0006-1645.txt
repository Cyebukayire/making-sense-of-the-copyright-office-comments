Artificial intelligence needs to be used with consent or else it is a copyright violation. These programs draw directly from the source, incorporating others pictures, songs and writing for example into a dataset without consent. This is then used directly to produce images which are marketed. This is a violation of the consent of artists and also their copyright. <br/><br/>These AI companies should have their datasets be opt in with consent. They should also be publicly accessible. Anything less is theft of the artist.
