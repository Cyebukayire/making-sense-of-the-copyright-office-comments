My name is Benjamin Berman, and I am a game developer using generative artificial intelligence for my video game Spellsource. I also run a venture funded video game technology business AppMana, and I direct and develop games for Nike, Visa, Hyundai, Wendy&#39;s, the PGA and other companies as part of my creative business. Additionally, I performed research on generative artificial intelligence while a student at MIT, writing my thesis on then-state-of-the-art generative models and exploring issues like copyright with the Berkman Center from 2015-2017. I&#39;ve been invited to speak on AI generative content long before it entered the mainstream, and I&#39;ve been using it in my practice for almost 8 years. My opinions are based on a decade of experience in the film, publishing and video game industries, and my status as a software engineer and artist with work published in the New York Times, by the renown game developer Scopely and through my partnership with Meta.<br/><br/>The Office made a colossal error cancelling Kashtanova&#39;s registration of the Midjourney generated artwork in Zarya of the Dawn.<br/><br/>First, as a procedural matter, the fact that the Office looked at the generated output on its face and saw no issues with its registration in the beginning should indicate the shakiness of its grounds for later cancelling the registration. Just because the Office was caught with its proverbial pants down, reacting to social media, doesn&#39;t mean that its original decision was wrong. At the very minimum, the Office should have allowed registrations like it to proceed, and allow an ordinary process, like congressional action or an actual complaint from someone else aggrieved by the registration, to resolve the issue.<br/><br/>That said, if I submitted a spreadsheet of NBA player statistics for copyright registration, the Office would know exactly what to do: the arrangement can be copyrighted but the facts cannot. This is easy to deal with, because it&#39;s obvious how statistics look like each other. If I submitted a photograph of a monkey, the Office would swiftly register it, and if it turned out later that picture was taken by the monkey as a selfie, I&#39;m not sure how the piece of erratum &quot;the Office was caught with its pants down&quot; makes a monkey taking a picture and Midjourney generating images anything at all like each other. And yet that&#39;s exactly what your letter does, equivocating crank spiritual music, a photographer&#39;s idiosyncratic, legitimate commercial property labeled the work of a monkey due to exceptionally rare circumstances, and a very sophisticated piece of software. The way the Office swiftly approves registrations, and yet applies court decisions of no real, factual, objective, in-real-life meaningful relationship to each other, says to me that the substance of the issues are very poorly understood by the Office.<br/><br/>The most egregious mistake in the Lindberg letter is &quot;How Midjourney Works,&quot; which actually conflates a flawed characterization of Midjourney&#39;s technology with a flawed perspective on how a &quot;human artist, writer or photographer&quot; &quot;obtain[s]&quot; &quot;satisfactory image[s].&quot; First, Midjourney and related generative AI technologies that turn text into creative outputs like other text or art most certainly do &quot;understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans,&quot; Midjourney&#39;s own description notwithstanding. There are numerous demonstrations of the capability of the systems to understand the grammar and sentence structure of the prompts, such as the attachment I provided sourced from (https://twitter.com/heyBarsee/status/1638450096034439172). It illustrates &quot;Old man resting head on juicy cheeseburger,&quot; which never renders a cheeseburger resting a head (of lettuce) on an old man. You are going to receive hundreds of examples like these, so I will not belabor the point here. The Midjourney service would be worthless if it didn&#39;t interpret prompts in the intelligent, purposeful and predictive the way it does.<br/><br/>The interpretation is happening much more similarly to Microsoft Word, After Effects and Maya interpreting their saved files: it is most certainly a much more deterministic and interpretive process than characterized in the letter.<br/><br/>What does the Office think creative professionals do, exactly? &quot;The process by which a Midjourney user obtains an ultimate satisfactory image through the tool is not the same as that of a human artist, writer, or photographer.&quot; You are in for an eye-opening experience when you see how film directors work, how writers rooms work, how studio artists with workshops work: it&#39;s the same thing! It&#39;s choosing from a bunch of options. And they all get copyright to &quot;their&quot; &quot;work,&quot; as their minions do the work. Midjourney is a piece of software that does the work of the staff artists in the studio; the user plays the role of the head artist, director, etc. It&#39;s so obvious to me that it&#39;s baffling.<br/><br/>The Office must allow people to claim copyright on the work generated by software they use.<br/><br/>
