Generative artificial intelligence technologies like language and image models offer significant opportunities for education, industry, and creativity. As these models do not store or replicate training data, but instead learn patterns to autonomously generate new outputs, there are reasonable arguments they should not be strictly limited by the original copyright of that data.<br/><br/>Open-source and publicly available generative models in particular have demonstrated potential for wide-ranging benefits. Models releasing their training code and parameters allow continued progress through community collaboration and modification. When access is unrestricted, these models empower researchers, entrepreneurs, students and individuals to pursue new applications and discoveries.<br/><br/>While copyright exists to protect original works, overly broad interpretation in relation to AI training could paradoxically restrict further innovation. As generative models transform, not merely duplicate, their inputs, exclusive licensing may not always align with promoting the progress of science and useful arts. For the advancement of knowledge and public welfare, permissive use of copyrighted materials for generative AI development deserves thoughtful consideration.
