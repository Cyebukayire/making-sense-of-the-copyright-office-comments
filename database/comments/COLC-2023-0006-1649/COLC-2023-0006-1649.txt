It is absolutely vital for small startups and individuals in the US wanting to innovate in area of AI that all training of machine learning on copyrighted works be considered as fair use (and not require  the rights holders&#39; permission)<br/><br/>If this is not the case then only the largest corporate entities will be able to license required training data to create high quality models and AI development will remain in the hands of large corporate players.<br/><br/>Additionally, other countries such as Israel, have already adopted this as their default position and consider unathorized training as falling under fair use, see attached file which is the Israeli Ministry of Justice&#39;s opinion supporting unauthorized use of copyrighted works for machine learning (English abstract translation is on pg. 3)<br/><br/>Should the US require permission or authorization and/or licensing for use of copyrighted works in machine learning, while any other single country does not, then smaller entities, startups and individuals will simply leave the US to develop in such AI-friendly jurisdictions.<br/><br/>The unauthorized use of copyrighted works for training data in AI models must be considered fair use for the US to remain a leader in AI development and ensure that smaller startups and individuals are able to compete on a level playing field with large corporate entities.
