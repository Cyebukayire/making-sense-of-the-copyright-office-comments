As someone who works heavily in the tech industry, specifically for Game Development, the way AI is being used currently is terrifying. For both the individual, *and* the company. It stems from the fact that there is no fundamental protection on what AI can be trained on, and the usage of those training materials. Because an AI can be fed works without the artist&#39;s consent for the AI to learn and replicate from, the AI can then create images, text, audio, and other procedurally generated content that matches those styles and can infringe upon the creative licenses of the original creators. <br/><br/>It differs greatly from an individual being inspired or performing a transformative work in my mind, because the AI isn&#39;t attempting to transform a piece of art, it&#39;s attempting to replicate.
