In regards to &#39;the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models and whether this constitutes infringement&#39;- I feel that, without some form of contract or agreement directly between the original copywriter holder, the company or persons responsible for training the AI and the persons seeking to copywrite the resulting material, such generation does constitute infringement- the data was not ethicly, consentingly, informably or legally sourced, and could be compared to sneaking nto someones home in order to &#39;analyse&#39; their personal photo library. The learning library should be sourced exclusively from OFFERED or AGREED upon material. Please note that &#39;scraping&#39; the process by which many current AI are trained, does not meet these requirements: simply posting an image online does qualify as consent or agreement.<br/><br/>In regards to &#39;the extent to which AI-generated content should or could be copyrighted, particularly when a human has exercised some degree of control over the AI model&rsquo;s operations&#39;- should only be answered AFTER the former issue has been addressed. Assuming that the AI was trained using ethicly sourced material, and was generated by the AI, there was limited creative, original content issues. However, in depth analysis and editing/direction from a &#39;prompter&#39; could be allowed for definition as a &#39;editor&#39; or &#39;finder&#39;, similar to the work of a photo editor. Therefore , copywrite should be similarly defined as in regards to said Photo Editors. <br/><br/>In regards to &#39;how liability should be applied if AI-generated content infringes on existing copyrights&#39; fines and reimbursement to the copywrite holder who was infringed upon, and a requirement for the infringed material to be removed from the AI&#39;s training database. (I am aware that this can be difficult for many AI programs, which unfortunately, suggests that said AI may require being retrained entirely. I suggest that is an issue for the AI developers to overcome, and that they should see it as another avenue of healthy competition in regards to improving their product.)<br/>In regards to &#39;the impact of AI mimicking voices or styles of human artists&#39; I suggest similar conditions to those used in Yamaha&#39;s VOCALOID technology, where the voice of a singer or artist was &#39;purchased&#39; and guidelines agreed upon. This would also crack down on instances of forgery and deep fakes. Simply &#39;borrowing&#39; a celebrities voice without any form of consent could be seen as not only infringement upon their rights regarding to cooywrite, but also potentially those regarding free speech, and cases involving defamation and/or slander, as will no doubt emerge in the near future. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
