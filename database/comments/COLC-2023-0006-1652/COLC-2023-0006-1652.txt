The copyright office must side with humans over AI or lose it&#39;s purpose in the first place.<br/><br/>These AI systems are a twisted abuse of our laws and an insult to human dignity. The level of exploitation is truly breathtaking and without government action the damage will be irreparable sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>AI systems are built off the back of copyrighted data. They stand in direct competition with the original rights holder and their widespread reckless use is actively destroying every internet marketplace. This is not fair use or transformative use. If the copyright office does not act to reign in these systems the results will be catastrophic.<br/><br/>We have seen, fairly quickly in fact, that AI systems are being used for the mass generation of CSAM content. In addition to that these systems have enabled a new industry of porn generated from social media profiles. This technology will make social media not only unusable but actively dangerous. <br/><br/>I ask you, would you bring a child into this world, knowing that we are actively allowing AI companies to replace all creative industries.<br/><br/>This is not just a fight over basic copyright where a difference of opinion means little in the grand scheme of things. Allowing AI companies to abuse the notion of copyright is societally destabilizing and I beg you to take the time to think through all of the implications around this tech. <br/><br/>Regulate this now or you will have a great depression on your hands before you can blink. The fact that I submit this, in fear that my employer could retaliate against me for not embracing AI, should inform you of how far this are already gone. <br/>
