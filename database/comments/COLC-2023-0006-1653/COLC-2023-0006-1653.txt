As a writer both professionally and recreationally, I am uncomfortable with the idea that AI (which uses other people&rsquo;s intellectual property to generate content and does not have the same nuance as a human mind) could ever hold a copyright or produce content that can be copyrighted. I believe it&rsquo;s the US government&rsquo;s duty to protect its labor force by ensuring content creation jobs (illustration, writing, music making, etc) are performed by people, not by AI. This is essential to ensuring the longevity of our artistic markets, protecting IP, and avoiding the spread of disinformation. <br/><br/>I also strongly believe that AI generated content should be labeled as such.
