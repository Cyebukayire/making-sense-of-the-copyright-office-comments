Artificial intelligence violates the inherent idea of copyright. Majority of AI programs are trained using stolen and private information, profiting off of the unpaid labor of others. There needs to be strict regulation for the use, if any, of artificial intelligence that will only be trained on data given with consent and used by others only with consent.
