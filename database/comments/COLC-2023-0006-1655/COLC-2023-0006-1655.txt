Generative A.I., as it&#39;s currently known, is a blight on every creative industry on earth. Not only are the current major players scraping artwork across the internet with no intention of compensating the individuals on whose art these models are being trained, but now it&#39;s come to light that platforms like chatGPT are scraping written works in the exact same way. There needs to be a comprehensive effort made to regulate and/or outright ban this type of machine-learning until the creatives upon which all of the generators are built are properly compensated for having their livelihoods shamelessly and gleefully stolen.
