Artificial Intelligence is built on work stolen from artists, authors, coders, actors, models, and other laborers without consent or compensation. There need to be stricter rules, a hard reset of databases that have scraped information prior to the terms of use updated to give tech giants those permissions, and absolutely no path for ai generators to claim copyright to work built on stolen properties. Individuals should maintain the right to seek compensation should their work be used, copied, or sold to generative learning databases for a LIMITED amount of time, and maintain the right prior to accepting payment or after said time has expired to strike their work from bare minimum.
