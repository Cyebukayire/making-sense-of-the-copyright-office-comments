AI can be a very good tool in the same way that the internet has become a good tool of putting ideas together. However, it is not promising that the firsts uses of AI has been theft of intellectual property, private medical data, and real human likeness to &quot;create something new.&quot; <br/><br/>AI has nothing to add to the economy; AI generates the &quot;perfect vision of the consumer&quot; by using existing intellectual property and people. It does not generate a &quot;competitive market.&quot; It steals from the existing market until something is created to generate monetary worth.<br/><br/>Consider that Amazon uses AI to summerize reviews by scraping testimonials from actual people leaving the reviews. Would Amazon be allowed to sue the company whose product was being reviewed if said company copied and pasted the AI review onto their direct website? As a byproduct of multiple creators, would Amazon then have to pay out each reviewer for using their words to create the AI summary if the company is allowed to sue? <br/><br/>AI in itself exists because of involuntary human collaboration.  If AI generated works/films/productions/products become legally protected, it would follow suit that the &quot;Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidence&quot; would lose credence on the principle that AI generated pieces do not exist by &quot;pure coincidence&quot;. AI is generated by purposeful uploading and mining accessible data. It is an unfortunate wickedness in our age of social media as much as hacking and computer viruses began to exist with the internet&#39;s conception.<br/><br/>Real people of all ages and appearance are already being used from their incidental photographs, films, medical records, social media and business posts to establish an AI Pornography &quot;market&quot;. AI is mining voice data and can potentially ruin the livelihood of anyone: from performers, politicians, to receptionists who pick up the phone of their local business.These are all &quot;assets&quot; from an unwilling base. To allow AI copyright protection would encourage privacy violation, create unease and a fear of intellectual property loss, and tie the hands of the most vulnerable who do not readily have the means to tackle or protest against this ever-churning tool. AI does not need protection- We as a people- as a species that thrives on intellectual pursuits and personal identity - needs protection in place. <br/>This may change, but only if our first line of defense- the people in our government- see this power ploy for what it is an doesn&#39;t entertain the greed and indignation of these individuals.<br/><br/>We as a people can only watch as AI use veers quickly and readily from a tool into a weapon against the visible person and the humanitarian arts. The fact that AI advocates are seeking recompense from our government for their ill-gotten gains is proof that it&#39;s foundation is set in control and in money, not equality in &quot;expression&quot;.<br/><br/>AI generation is not geared as a tool towards innovation, communication, or connection. Its entire existence is based on trespassing on the rights of others.<br/><br/>
