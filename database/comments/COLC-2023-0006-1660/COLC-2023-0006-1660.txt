The US Government needs to take steps to protect our future - we are on the brink of becoming a society where people are relegated to monotonous, soul-crushing jobs while machines take our places in creating the things that are supposed to make life worth living - art, music, poetry, music, and more.<br/><br/>Art is meant to express our souls, the pain and beauty of human existence. Don&#39;t let AI and corporate greed steal that away. Protect the things that we create - our writing, our paintings, our voices. <br/><br/>If companies believe they can just tell a computer to create some soulless approximation of the human existence for free, rather than pay an artist to produce an infinitely more meaningful expression of their heart and talent, then no artist will ever be able to sustain themselves through their craft again.<br/><br/>Bleak is the future where machines regurgitate an empty facsimile of our own creations at us, while the artists who created the works the AI trained on starve in the street.
