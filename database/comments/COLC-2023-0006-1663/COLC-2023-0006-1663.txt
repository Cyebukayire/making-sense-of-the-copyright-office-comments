Thank you for allowing the public to comment on this important issue. As a college student majoring in concept art/visdev, AI art directly impacts the field I have spent 4 years worth of time and money training for. I fully believe that AI art as it exists currently is extremely flawed- None of the artists or writers being used to train the AI are being asked for consent nor are they being compensated. As-is, both their completed work and even their employment opportunities are being stolen from them. Therefore, I believe that in order for these AI-generated works to be viable for copyright, consent must be involved in the training process, as well as having a human significantly alter the resulting image or article further after it is generated. Again, thank you so much for allowing input on this extremely important issue.
