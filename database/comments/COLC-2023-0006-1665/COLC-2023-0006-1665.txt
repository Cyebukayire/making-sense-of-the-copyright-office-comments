I&#39;m a 15-year-old American currently living in Germany, deeply concerned about proposed copyright changes that threaten open-source AI. Let&#39;s not forget, technologies like the computer and typewriter were once viewed as job-killers. They ended up creating industries and roles we couldn&#39;t have imagined.<br/><br/>AI carries this same transformative potential. It can open doors to new sectors, redefine roles, and create jobs that don&#39;t exist today. However, restricting public data for AI training is a roadblock on this path, benefiting only large corporations with the resources to license data.<br/><br/>As someone invested in coding and research, open-source models are invaluable for my learning. These resources don&#39;t just benefit individuals; they advance academic research and small business initiatives, contributing to job creation in the long run.<br/><br/>Copyright law should protect creators without stifling innovation or job opportunities. I strongly urge a reconsideration of changes that could hinder public data use for AI, centralize power in big tech, and threaten the open-source ecosystem that many of us rely on.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this urgent issue.
