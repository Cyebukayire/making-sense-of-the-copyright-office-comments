Please only allow consented works in data training. Please do not allow AI work to be copywritten as it&rsquo;s entirely composed of existing work it&rsquo;s trained on. The only uniqueness to it is the prompt, which is not enough to copyright, as each prompt is not always unique from other prompts. Allow human artists to copyright their works so there is copyright liability when it&rsquo;s used without permission to train AI. There should be no liability for AI work as it borrows from existing work and is not unique in that regard.
