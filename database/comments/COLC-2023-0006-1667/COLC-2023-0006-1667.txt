AI algorithms should not be legal when they are fed &quot;input&quot; made by human artists. It should not be permitted to use AI for art in general, as they not only unethically acquire art to use for an algorithm, they perpetuate the loss of jobs for artists and those in creative fields, undermining the years of work it takes to become successful in said fields. Businesses, corporations, and the like should not use unethical methods of graphic design for their companies and brands, and instead should employ artists from the start. Company loyalty, consistent design, and economic stimulation are only a few positives that come from employing artists instead of using AI.
