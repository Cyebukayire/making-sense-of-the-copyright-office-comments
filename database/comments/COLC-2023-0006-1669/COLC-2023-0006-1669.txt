There is no human benefit it copyrighting the works of AI machines. What is the point of a copyright if not to protect the human right to creation? Extending these rights to non-human entities only complicates matters needlessly. Elephants in captivity have been known to enjoy painting as well, will we allow the zoos to place copyright claims on behalf of the elephants next? Copyright laws should exist to protect the rights to human creations made by human beings, not AI.
