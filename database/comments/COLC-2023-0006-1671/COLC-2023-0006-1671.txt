Hello, I think that if a creative work has more than 50 percent human effort, then it should be eligible under copyright law, but if it is under 50 percent, then it shouldn&#39;t be eligible under copyright law. Also, the copyright holders of the copyright material that was, is and will be used by AI crawlers and data scrapes should be entitled to compensation for usage of their data, but not any works completed by AI afterwards. Thank you for your time.
