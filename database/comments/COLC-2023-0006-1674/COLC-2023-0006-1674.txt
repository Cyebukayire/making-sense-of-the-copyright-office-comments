AI-generated products should never be allowed protection via copyright. By their nature, AI-generated products are NOT the product of an individual person&#39;s hard work, creativity, or personal experience. They are not even possibly developed from a group of people who have given their consent to create something together. AI-generated products are created by taking from at least one non-consenting creator, given the way all AI programs are trained to develop products/media. They are essentially &quot;stealing&quot; every time something is produced. The protections of copyright should be afforded to human creators who have put hard work into developing something that is solely theirs or their team&#39;s. Otherwise, this will be used by organizations in the future to disenfranchise creators. This will lead to a loss of jobs for creators. This will impact our economy and harm the growth of the human population overall.
