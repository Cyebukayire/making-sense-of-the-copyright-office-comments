It comes down to this: AIs do not store lossless copies of what they learn from. An AI can produce something &quot;in the style of&quot; something else, in much the same way a human artist could, but it can&#39;t reproduce the full text of a book it was shown, or draw the Mona Lisa precisely. This is clearly a transformative work as a result, the same as if I were to make a new piece of art after having studied the Mona Lisa, or made from small clippings of a copy of the Mona Lisa rearranged to form a smiling face. Anything else would be lethal to AI innovation, and sicken public culture as a whole due to the regression on transformative works. Please look beyond this moment in time and consider how your regulations might stifle the most important technological advance of our time.
