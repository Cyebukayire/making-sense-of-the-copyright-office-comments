I don&rsquo;t think AI-created works should be copyright protected. Much of the AI-generated content currently on the Internet is made using work done by artists and writers that is already copyrighted, infringing on their own copyrights, and I and other artists have lost work due to people using work we put our own time, money, and energy into. Using AI system prompts to have a computer take all these copyrighted works and make something that uses other people&rsquo;s work without permission and takes way, way less time and personal investment shouldn&rsquo;t be considered artwork of its own.
