I would like to support the idea to prevent AI art from being allowed copyrights.  I feel it is vital to incentivize creativity by allowing creators to protect there work and think allowing AI to use it without consent to generate work is the opposite the what the copyright was designed to do and will have a chilling effect on putting skilled professionals in the field and the creation of new work.  I also support not allowing AI art to be copyrighted for the same reason.  I hope the copyright office will continue to do its job of incentivizing and supporting of the advance creativity and innovation and think that allowing an algorithm to vomit dubiously learned content will have chilling effect on that and give giant corporations a monopoly on it.
