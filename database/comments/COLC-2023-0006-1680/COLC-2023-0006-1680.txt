I believe that AI &#39;Art&#39; is something very dangerous, and allowing it to be placed under copyright will create a dangerous precedent that will encourage commercial entities to eliminate the use of human artists, placing humans who create art at risk of unemployment and homelessness.<br/><br/>We have already seen public backlash against AI Art from commercial entities, such as this instance with Wizards of the coast- https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/wotc-under-fire-for-ai-generated-images-in-new-dungeons-dragons-product/ar-AA1eQ93P<br/><br/>But public backlash is rarely enough to stifle the dehumanization of work in search of profit that many commercial entities attempt. Unless AI Art is by law something that cannot be copyrighted, it can and will be used to eliminate human jobs and livelihoods.
