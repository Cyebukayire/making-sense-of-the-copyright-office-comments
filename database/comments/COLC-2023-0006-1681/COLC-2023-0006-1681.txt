As an artist I can both appreciate and fear AI. Appreciation comes from the automation of tools, quick turn arounds, and ease of concepts. <br/><br/>I can also appreciate the individual using AI as an art medium and using its results as their own in private. When one tries to use that art for monetary or notoriety gain is where I have an issue. <br/><br/>In order for any AI to work there must have been human interaction first. That needs to be addressed and the original author of the material should be compensated period. Weather it is through a credit system like Adobe&#39;s where AI will only use images that are indexed, and vetted by the site. Then a AI user can make there art from that index. <br/>Now the artist knows when their art has been used, how their property was used , and,  get compensated for the original work if applied. Those humans have a right to their property by law and earnings as a result of. <br/><br/>Cutting original art into pieces and using it in a new art form is not new or groundbreaking. <br/><br/>I feel looking at the current copyright laws in regards to when it is a violation and when it is a new creation would be a good starting point. AI art for instance is clips of original art arranged to create a new. How would this be treated if it was a song? How much sampling can be done before it is an infringement? Same with an image or even literature. AI is just a form of sampling. Music has had this issue for decades. Literature even longer.<br/><br/>Yes words, sounds, and images are free and readily available on the internet. All is free to use to an extent, but when arranged purposefully the original images are the original art. No matter how you distort or manipulate it.<br/><br/>I for instance use AI as a concept tool to begin my art, but I would never include or even use it as an original because to me that would be a copyright infringement. I&#39;m sure the concept artist fears being found obsolete by my practice that has been already adopted by game companies. Their worries are founded but a human final touch will be needed, for now. Still a need for as many traditional artist will dwindle and the need for AI artist will grow.<br/><br/>That&#39;s another huge topic for AI to tackle. Job loss and condensation of jobs due to cutting out the need for as many artist. Artist need to evolve, but when does the art industries start reeling similarly to the coal industry. You are trained but not needed any longer. Obsolete. What do you do next? Evolution is important for both the artist and the laws.
