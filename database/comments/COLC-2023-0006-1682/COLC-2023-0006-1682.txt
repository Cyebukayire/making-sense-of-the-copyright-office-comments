AI can be a great tool, but in it&#39;s current state it&#39;s highly problematic.<br/><br/>Referring to imagery as that&#39;s my field of expertise; Current iterations of AI generated works are built off the labor of a collection of individual workers, turning their own hard work against them. Some even losing work to facsimiles of their own labor - in some cases, using targeted models made with stable diffusion with no accountability.&sup1; The results may be good, but any generative system would be when it&#39;s based off the hard work of others. I&#39;ve worked in 3D for various US owned entities and clients for years and other generative system only use cleared assets (such as purchased assets from repositories i.e &quot;turbosquid&quot;), public domain or studio made/owned assets in their generative applications such as &quot;Houdini&quot; or &quot;Maya&quot; - why should this be any different to that precedent?<br/><br/>Even without targeted training - such systems as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc. can directly call up many artists, IP, character or even individual likenesses in it&#39;s dataset with no current way to remove them. No for-profit or entity, or entity taking funding should even have the ability to do this. Such systems should be retrained on Public Domain - any further training should Opt-In only. An Individual should have the right to say no. Especially if an entity is profiting from it - i.e Midjourney - some even offering specialized branches such as &quot;Niji&quot; branch of generations specifically targeted on images scraped from places like Pinterest and Danbooru.&sup2;<br/><br/>What this creates is a culture where any creator is actively punished for merely sharing their work online, either to portfolios or personal content locations, such as personal websites, many creators going into closed door spaces, ruining public growth. This is not the same as an individual taking inspiration, contextually it&#39;s different and volume wise an individual never impedes on the original creator. The default stance should not be anything online is open for use - public domain and opt-in is the only fair way forward. These systems must be retrained.
