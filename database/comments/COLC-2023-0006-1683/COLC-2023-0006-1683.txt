The use of AI is impossible to monitor, control, copyright or regulate. It should not be used by companies to exploit labour, put people out of work at drastic rates or steal from copyrighted artists works. I personally do not see it&rsquo;s need or usefulness in any industries other than research oriented purposes. It should not be replacing people and taking away our passions for our careers and work. It is diluting the essence of any type of work it&rsquo;s replacing by its speed and creates a pattern of dis appreciation. People are becoming even more expandable because of it. It is crossing boundaries of what is real and what is not. It is encouraging cheating with schools and learning. It is making us as humans more lazy. We are simply degrading in every ability we have as we are letting AI do all the work for us in terms of thinking, going through process of research ourselves and continuing to develop critical thinking. I do not know what our children have to look forward to in a world where learning is discouraged since AI has the answer, working is discouraged since AI will beat us with time and cost, going to movies will be discouraged as no one wants to keep watching AI generated actors or animation. There is a reason why we exist and we shouldn&rsquo;t keep replacing ourselves with machines. AI can be put to great use- healthcare research, diseases, developing technology for clean energy, efficiency that will be good for planet earth. It&rsquo;s impoverishing the peoples abilities to be contributing factors and it&rsquo;s diminishing all we find inspiring and appreciation for.
