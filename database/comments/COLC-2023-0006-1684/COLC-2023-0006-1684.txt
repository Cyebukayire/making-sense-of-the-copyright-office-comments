As AI must (generally) have access to training materials that are drawn from primary sources, I think the following should be required.<br/>1) all materials used in training should be documented, including sources and copyright holder information, and how the material was used, The AI people will claim this ism&rdquo;too difficult&rdquo; but is truly just another database and if they are scouring the internet without care over whether or not their source material is in the public domain, then they are just committing theft of intellectual property and then hiding it. The fair use agreements do not cover this use.<br/><br/>2. Fair compensation for use of IP for training purposes must be included. If an AI is a commercial product that succeeds based on its training material, it used those source materials and the owners should be compensated fairly.<br/><br/>3. AI &ldquo;bots&rdquo; that generate content based on materials they scan from sources and then compile or summarize into final documents should be required to include a citation of all sources they used to produce their &ldquo;product.&rdquo; This is for two reasons A. So that human users can vet the production for accuracy/truth, and B. So that any necessary IP rights are protected and proper compensation is provided (where there is an expectation under copyright laws).<br/><br/>4. AI will eventually start citing other AI sources. This is just another way to hide the trail of IP theft. A bar on use of incited material would deal with this effectively by stopping use of material that lacked proper attributions. Attributing sources to an AI only should be disallowed since the machines are basically incapable of original production without having been trained on prior human productions or human-generated software. This no AI productions should be copyrighted ever. <br/><br/>5. The thorny issue of products that are partially AI generated and how to copyright them is going to be a problem. One suggestion is to limit the amount of AI content in any product that can be included before it loses copyright protection entirely.it should still be required that it be cited if used as a source, but no payment for its use should ever be required. Somehow, the human authors rights must be protected. So&hellip;one thought is that the owners of the AI can never collect anything for the products produced. All money earned should go to the humans. Period. So, if there IS a copyright, it belongs to the human authors.
