I think that AI, which is often trained using other people&#39;s writing or artwork, is a major issue. The creators are often not asked if their work can be used and it is making it harder for them to make a living with their work, since people can use AI to try and get something similar to their style for free. If more rules and regulations aren&#39;t put into place for AI soon, it will likely create huge problems for many people and will impact the ability for people to make a living through creative fields.
