Hello, I speak as a traditional animator who&#39;s worked on TV, film and commercial work in the US and overseas. I also speak as a concerned citizen, because decisions around AI use in the arts is applicable to much of the data we as Americans all share online, in our private lives, public lives and our professional lives. I think AI could be a wonderful tool for society in general but not in it&#39;s current form. There are two primary issues with AI use today.<br/><br/>The first is around our data being used without our consent or compensation. Artists lose out on the ability to compete in the market place when their work or style can be generated by AI for profit or for free by anyone. And AI use naturally can create work at an exponential rate much higher than humans can. It&#39;s estimated that there are more images created by AI than photos taken in the history of photography. That&#39;s just in this technology&#39;s infancy. And regardless of what art comes out of AI, whether it&#39;s &quot;original&quot; or &quot;creative&quot;, none of it is possible without the data going in, which was not paid for or given permission to be collected.<br/><br/>The second is that even if a specific artist&#39;s work isn&#39;t in the training data set, that doesn&#39;t stop companies from using AI to replace that artist. We would be leaving large swathes of artists behind, indeed future artists behind, if just copyright holders were compensated. So I&#39;m afraid just tackling consent and compensation won&#39;t solve the problem. Many companies get government subsidies and tax breaks to set up in a certain state or country. That&#39;s primarily to generate jobs in the community and support surrounding industries that will indirectly interact with the studios. That&#39;s part of what a business owes a community, jobs, and we should not carelessly break that link, that up to this point was a given, with AI.<br/><br/>We need laws that allow artists, indeed all workers to work with AI for companies, not have companies use AI to replace them. There are many once thriving cities in the US that have been left behind like my hometown of Detroit due to a lack of jobs and economic activity. What a shame would it be to have cities left behind that have a lot of economic activity, many very profitable businesses, but none of that good fortune flows to the communities the businesses are in because most if not all their workforce is AI.<br/><br/>As far as laws and regulations, I leave that up to people far smarter than me in the U.S. Copyright Office and other parts of government to figure out the specifics of thoughtful laws and regulations. But I believe a government has an obligation to protect its citizens. This fast accelerating technology is nothing like previous forms of technology and we should not pretend it is so. We have to look at the specific facts of this specific technology and make informed choices. I watched the transition from traditional animation on paper to computer animation. Sadly some artists weren&#39;t able to adapt but the core issue was that artists were challenged to learn a new technology to do their job. Worker across industries today aren&#39;t being asked to learn a new technology to do their job. We are being told the new technology will do our job, and there might be a few people that can work alongside AI on things it struggles with today, while the other workers are displaced. And one day possibly AI won&#39;t struggle with those things tomorrow and even those workers won&#39;t be necessary.<br/><br/>AI can be a force for good in our country, but governments, businesses, and the people have to decide how it&#39;s implemented in our society. Under current law, only businesses get to decide how it&#39;s implemented and that&#39;s to the detriment of the government and the people. Thank you for your time.
