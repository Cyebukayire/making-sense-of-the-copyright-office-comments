I&#39;m an author/freelance writer and would like to see AI-generated elements treated much like public domain material. The unedited, unaltered original output from an AI writing or art program should be usable by anyone, but should be copyrightable when altered by a writer or artist- similar to when artists create a collage using public domain material or stock elements or when a writer creates a retelling of a public domain work (ex- The Little Mermaid story is public domain, but Disney&#39;s movie is copyrightable, but people can also make their own versions that don&#39;t use Disney-created elements)
