I personally believe that if something is created by a thieving image generator then it shouldn&#39;t be able to be copyrighted. <br/>It&#39;s not like the creation of these programs will stop actual artists from continuing their works, but rather steal their previous work and bastardize it into an amalgamation of images so that those unwilling to credit proper artistry can pass it off as their own. Whether or not generated &quot;art&quot; is actually art isn&#39;t the issue, what is the issue is that ai work is a collection of plagiarism, and that behavior should not be allowed.<br/>Thank you for your time.
