I feel that AI is operating in a way that takes it rely on public input. It generates content using art, writing, etc. Taken from others work. To allow it to be copy written is effectively endorsing the theft of public and private works. This will only benefit powerful companies who seek to minimize their labor costs. I believe that AI generated work should be viewed as a tool that all people can use. Make it part of the commons and it can grow to be more beneficial overtime, bit if copyright is allowed to be applied to the work generated by AI it will harm small creators and the labor of professionals in many industries while also being a detrimental to the arts and creativity of our society as a whole. <br/><br/>In short, make AI generated content part of the commons so everyone can use it as a tool, but not profit directly. This will continue to encourage in innovation in creative fields without displacing labor or empowering large corporations.
