If AI is going to be used at all, I&#39;d much rather it be used to make jobs safer and easier than to replace artists or writers. Leave all the creative jobs to humans and don&#39;t let AI steal and make poor imitations of human art. To be perfectly clear, AI should not be able to take and repackage art created by people.
