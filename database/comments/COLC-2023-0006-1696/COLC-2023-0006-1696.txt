Comment on the first issue: Collection and Curation of Datasets:  The unapproved, unremunerated wholesale use of copyrighted material to &quot;train&quot; artificial intelligence is blatant copyright violation. Without input being restricted to fair use, output inevitably plagiarizes copyrighted characters, plot lines, sentences.  Reading the book and stealing a paragraph to repeat in one&#39;s own writing breaks copyright; adding a machine to change one or two words doesn&#39;t change the underlying theft. Input should be restricted to fair use excerpts or copyright holders should expect the permission, compensation, and record-keeping due for large excerpts of their work.<br/><br/>Second Issue: Running software is not human creative effort. Someone assembling a precut quilt kit with a sewing machine cannot call it handstitched, give the sewing machine creative credit, or copyright the result without putting in significant transformative work. The same applies to &quot;precutting&quot; intellectual property into a dataset, running it through software, and attempting to copyright the result without adding a human-based creative transformation.<br/><br/>Third question: The responsibility for plagiarism in the output lies entirely with whichever party introduced copyrighted material to the input.  Neither software designer nor requestor could introduce stolen material - even if they wanted it! - without it having first been added to the dataset.
