I&#39;d like the Copyright Office to maintain the integrity and rights of authors and creators, not machines or corporations using machines to scrape their work. AI is too ripe for abuse and plagiarism by bad actors and scammers who want to profit without paying creators. A computer program cannot match human creativity because it cannot create anything by itself, and so it cannot be called an author, artist, filmmaker, editor, or any other type of creator. Already there are cases of authors having their books scraped, artists having their work stolen to be used by AI to produce cover art. To allow AI companies to copyright work stolen from people would be to destroy the principles of copyrighting itself.
