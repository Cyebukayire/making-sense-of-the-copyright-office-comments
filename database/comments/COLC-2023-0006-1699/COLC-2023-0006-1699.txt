I believe AI to be a potential destructive force, and the OPPOSITE of creative. A written computer program is a machine, and any &quot;art&quot; it generates is DERIVATIVE, not creative. By definition, anything &quot;created&quot; by a computer program should not be protected by copyright, indeed, it should be stopped from ripping off every writer and artist and musician and actor living and breathing in a biological body who has poured blood, sweat and tears into their art.<br/><br/>JUST FULL STOP. <br/><br/>AI could be a wonderful boon to humanity in the medical field. But its creators are worried for good reason, it&#39;s been released into the wild and can therefore be harnessed by criminals.<br/><br/>JUST FULL STOP THIS UTTER MADNESS. Listen to the scientists who know.
