The use of copyrighted material to train AI data without consent of the copyright holders is reprehensible and unfairly takes economic leverage and opportunity away from human creators like writers and artists and places it in the power of big tech companies. AI generated works should be considered non copyrightable due to the nature of the data they are trained on for this reason, as well as the fact that the creative agent is not human: creative works by animals such as monkeys cannot be copyrighted by humans
