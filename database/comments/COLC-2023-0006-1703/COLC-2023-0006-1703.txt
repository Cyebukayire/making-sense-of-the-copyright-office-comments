&#39;AI&#39; (artificial intelligence) is a very exciting and newly accessible technology for many. This makes many folks feel as though they are creating something (true) unique or only creatable by them (false). In the same way that plagiarism isn&#39;t tolerated and should not be sold for money, such as directly tracing or copying artwork for monetary gain, AI should not be used in any capacity that would have money exchanging hands or creating wealth for others through its sole use (ie a writer, artist, company or office using AI to create something that would then be sold for gains). AI is a pattern recognition tool that, while programmed by a human or group of people, still does not have the capacity for morally creating whatever it is that it makes. It cannot tell you a &#39;why&#39; with feeling, only with pre-determined reasons coded into its process. Using images and text that have not been explicitly made or allowed for use by AI to &#39;build&#39; its informational background is unethical and should be considered a form of stealing, in the event of the produced work making money or acclaim. Furthermore, all AI-created items should be required to have a label of that type, and anyone found to be utilizing AI for gains without disclosing their AI use should be prosecuted in the same vein as plagiarizing. AI is not inherently bad and it may even come to help systems like architecture or public communications, given the proper regulations that will allow creatives to still retain value in their works in legally protected manners.
