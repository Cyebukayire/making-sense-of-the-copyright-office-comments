I strongly believe that AI needs to be regulated. I think AI has the capacity to be dangerous to individuals as well as corporate bodies. It is a tool that wealthy individuals wish to use in order to downsize employment and frankly, on human rights. I think AI can be weaponized politically in a variety of ways and can be abused by individuals. AI should be used in order to better humanity. It could assist doctors and scientists to help us deal with so many issues we face today, including the biggie, climate change.
