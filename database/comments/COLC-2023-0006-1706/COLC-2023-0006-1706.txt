How can you copyright text that has been gathered from scores of sources loaded into the machine?  There is nothing &quot;original&quot; about such text.  It clearly derives from the original authors, not the machine itself.  No copyright rules protect the authors whose original work has been &#39;stolen&#39; in order to educate the machine, so why should the machine (and the people/corporations using the machine) be protected?  As a former Appellate litigator whose life&#39;s work is on file in federal and state court records, I object that my creative efforts may be copied and grafted into untrue and false legal arguments.  I have already read of at least one case where the machine created a false legal argument out of the &quot;whole cloth&quot; of briefs loaded into it.  The attorneys who failed to review the &quot;created&quot; case law cited in the brief were disciplined for attempting to mislead the court.  Why on earth would such false and misleading text be entitled to copyright?
