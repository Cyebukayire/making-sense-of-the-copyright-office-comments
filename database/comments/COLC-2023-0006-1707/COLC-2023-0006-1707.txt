There is no &quot;minmum modification&quot; that an AI program has to make to an image in order to redistribute it, now suddenly as a &quot;new&quot; work with a different, or currently no, copyright.  This allows one to effortlessly launder an image by making tiny insubstantial changes and then displaying it as a new work. And the rate at which these works can be created makes it impossible to personally resolve each with a court case. <br/><br/>It might seem like the solution is to include some kind of limitation, a sort of minimum amount of change made before an artwork can be generated, but I guarantee you this will not work because the AI itself will be making these changes, and they could easily be modified to for example shift everything 1 pixel to the left or right, causing the image to be comparatively different, or modify the color 1 shade darker, making it &quot;100% different&quot;. Or most likely the /metadata/ on the image would be changed but not the image itself, so the ai and any computer scanning the image will think it&#39;s different when it isn&#39;t. <br/><br/>The damage that AI art programs will do to every sector of human creation is going to be significant, even if it&#39;s tightly monitored and restricted, but if left unchecked it will continue to collapse entire industries, making them reliant on AI. But AI is already demonstrably getting worse because as it&#39;s fed more AI images it reproduces and magnifies the small subtle mistakes, each generation becoming exponentially worse. As the total amount of AI generated images grows their quality will continue to drop even as it becomes impossible to compete on a financial scale with making thousands of pieces of art and writing for free. <br/><br/>The inevitable conclusion is that industries will become more and more rapidly saturated with AI works due to their pricing, whose quality is growing worse the more saturated the market becomes.Every major industry is already having major industry leaders cutting corners and producing terrible low quality content using AI art and unless it is tightly regulated or banned this will only get worse.
