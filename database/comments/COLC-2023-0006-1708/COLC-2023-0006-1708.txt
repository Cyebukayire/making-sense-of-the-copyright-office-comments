It is important to note while described as intelligent for marketing purposes, the AI systems of today are far from intelligent. Moreover, to describe what they do as creating new art is false, and it would be more accurate to say they create a collage made of the art that was fed into the machine learning process. While the specific process is new, I believe there is already a precedent set for collage art that would be applicable here. Which is to say unless the machine is only using fair use art for its generation, the copyright holders of the art used should have a right to say how their art is used, especially if copyrights are to be granted to works using their own copyright.
