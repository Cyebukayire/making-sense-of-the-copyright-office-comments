Thank you for opening this topic up to public comment. As someone who is a creative and works in a creative field involving both writing and art, this issue directly affects my livelihood, as well as the livelihoods of all my coworkers and the freelance artists and writers that we collaborate with. <br/><br/>Issue 1) Any materials used in AI training sets should only be used with informed and opt-in consent, at a minimum. Required compensation for the authors of the works used in the training set should also be considered, as trained AI models are intended for financial gain. Copyright is designed to protect human author&#39;s profit from their work, and the current system of AI training threatens that goal. The Copyright Act offers a certain time period where an author has exclusive rights to their work, so while works in the public domain may be used, works still within that time period should be exempt by default from AI training unless informed, opt-in consent is given by the author. Since AI training of a piece cannot reasonably be undone at this moment (the only way to retroactively remove a portion of an AI&#39;s dataset is by re-training the algorithms from scratch), uninformed or opt-out consent are not strong enough protections. The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training AI on copyrighted works without the informed and opt-in consent of the author(s) of these works violates the Copyright Act. Given the global nature of the matter, the terms of AI training should be given in layman&#39;s terms and offered in multiple languages.<br/><br/>Issue 2) Results produced from AI should not be eligible for copyright without further human contribution deemed transformative from the initial AI result. Anything generated by AI, regardless of a human&rsquo;s guiding prompts, is still created by the AI and should be deemed insufficient for copyright. Non-human animals cannot obtain a copyright for anything they create, regardless of human prompting, and a machine system created to endlessly remix input should not be able to either. <br/><br/>Issue 3) The four pillars of fair use should apply to results produced from AI when determining potential copyright violations. Is the work used to train the AI available commercially? Is the AI result being used commercially? Was the AI result produced and then transformed by a human? Was the work published or unpublished? Is the AI result in competition with any of the works used in the training set? AI models are not trained on individual works but on mass data sets -- how much of an author&rsquo;s oeuvre was used in a training set? To help answer some of these questions, AI models should be required to retain complete records of all the materials used in their own training sets (potentially including metadata of author information, like a web handle or legal name that the work was released or shared under), and those records and materials should be available to the public for accountability and so that cases of potential copyright infringement may be proven. As the data sets required to train an AI can be hundreds of gigabytes large, the records would also need to be navigable or searchable to make them usable. If copyright is proven violated, financial compensation should offered in the form of royalties, as that work will be used by the AI on an ongoing basis unless it can be removed from the AI&#39;s training (which is not currently feasible). The compensation should be comparable to lost revenue from the author, and will act as a deterrent from violating copyright. <br/><br/>There is strong corporate pressure to use AI to replace jobs (look no further than the terms that the WGA and SAG-AFTRA are striking against in 2023) and we need protections to ensure that AI is a tool for us, rather than against us. Use of work in data training sets should also be clearly announced rather than quietly amended -- as of 9/7/23, Twitter/X recently updated its terms of service to automatically opt-in all public data in training AI, while simultaneously waiving users&#39; rights to join a class-act lawsuit. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration of these comments.<br/>
