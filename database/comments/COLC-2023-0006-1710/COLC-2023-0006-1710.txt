AI works are a complex piece of technology that should be developed, but not at the detriment of the livelihoods of artists, writers, musicians, etc. As most AI programs do not require payment or a small fee for their work, it makes corporations and the like more likely to fire all creative positions in favor of AI. <br/><br/>To prevent this, there should be copyright rules against AI works to promote human creative works. Using AI to support a work should be allowed, with some limitations, but copyrighting a work done completely by AI should not be allowed. The nature of how AI create works is by taking other creative works and synthesizing it into their own. Due to AI&#39;s own limitations, this can take entire portions of work from a creative and put it out as its own without meaningful change or parody. The programmers of such applications also do not require the AI to cite what creatives they used to create their works, which means their work is used and also not credited. <br/><br/>If the nature AI creative works were changed, it might be more of a tool than a replacement of creatives themselves. I hope that changing the way they can br copyrighted will facilitate that change.
