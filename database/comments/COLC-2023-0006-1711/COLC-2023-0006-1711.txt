Although AI can be a useful tool in the creation of art, like music, digital art, writing, and more, there are not enough protections for those who have their work used without consent by AI learning and for those who work in artistic industries as a whole. AI tools should be regulated to protect those whose work it uses to teach their algorithms and artists should be compensated if their work is used (Unless agreed otherwise). Artists should also have protections to prevent job loss from AI tools, such as making AI only works, such as art, writing, and music, uncopyrightable without documented human additions to the piece.
