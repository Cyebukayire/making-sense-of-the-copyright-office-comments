A.I. art is not art and should never be considered art. The entire concept of A.I. &quot;art&quot; relies on scanning samples from human made works and ripping what it desires to make a Frankenstein&#39;s monster. Nothing A.I. is original or artistic. It is all blatantly stolen and destroyed. From small up and coming creators, to well known professionals, they&#39;re hard work will be stolen and processed by an algorithm solely designed to steal and cut up. A.I. should be made illegal as it violates the basic protective rights every artist and artistic individual is granted. Keep copyright human. Keep Art human.
