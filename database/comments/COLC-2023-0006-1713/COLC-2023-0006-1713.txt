The training of AI should be limited to public domain works, and/or works that copyright holders specifically allow to be used for AI training, on a work-by-work basis, so that not all of the copyright holders works are included in the training unless specifically given permission. An opt-in system is the most efficient since it eliminates potential lawsuits and wasted time, money, and effort in court for both parties (this also prevents more stress on an overburdened legal system). <br/> Current technology may not be sufficient for an opt-in system, but it is always adapting and upgrading. Our modern telescopes can almost see to the edge of the universe--we can figure out a permission slip. The opt-in system should, under no circumstances, ever be compulsory. It goes against a person&#39;s freedom of choice.<br/>Unauthorized use of copyright materials by AI should not be considered fair, and will need to be corrected, with harmed parties receiving compensation. <br/>Copyright holders should be compensated for the use of  their work (in whole or in part) on a regular basis, receiving a percentage of revenue generated by the AI product, for as long as that product is in use.<br/>AI generated content does not exist without human input in some way. All human parties should be compensated for their time, effort, skill, talent, etc. that was used (in whole or in part) for the making of the AI content as well as the final product and its uses.<br/>Copyright liability should be apportioned between the user whose instructions prompted the output and the developers of the system and dataset.<br/>AI should not be used in place of humans, it should be used to enhance or enable human creativity and all human parties should be compensated accordingly. The technology is new and we have not seen all its potential yet. The laws and regulations will change to account for it over time. In the mean-time, human creators must be given some recourse for the lost revenue and competition that AI generated content  will cause in order to avoid hardship. Humans need to eat, AI does not.<br/>Public libraries will need a clear decision on AI content to better help library patrons. This is related to making copies on a public copier or printing form a computer.<br/>Developers of AI models  and creators of datasets must be required to collect, retain, and disclose records regarding the material used to develop and train their AI models to all parties involved, including, but not limited to the copyright holders and creators (if creators are not copyright holders, and are not due monetary compensation, recognition of the creator should still be given).<br/>Reproduction issues will probably be determined on a case-by-case basis with liability falling to developers of AI model and the developers of datasets.<br/>Label AI content so end users are aware.<br/>AI using the likeness of a person would lead to legal trouble or criminal charges for that person. If the AI generates a contract in someone&#39;s name complete with signature, how does that person disprove it? How would a person disprove a voice recording as not their own? Care must be taken, and all options and scenarios considered, before the technology is utilized in such a way. A law will be required to prevent the use of likeness by AI (authorized or unauthorized) without strict protocol and ongoing compensation. A time limit and strict description of uses allowed for use of likeness by AI would help, as would complete control being held by the person(s) whose likeness(es) is(are) being used.<br/>AI models, datasets, and content are reliant on human involvement, and humans should be given the most fair outcome possible.
