AI works should never be copyrighted, as they rely entirely on previously created pieces to exist. They are an entirely derivative function of other people&#39;s pre-existing artistic labors, and the person generating the AI piece has had absolutely no creative input to the process. Unlike something like a remix of a song, AI works do not include any sort of artistry. A remixer needs to know how to produce music, how to use music editing software, and must have a general talent for song composition to create a remix of a song. An AI user simply types in a generic sentence prompt, and is given an output scraped together from other people&#39;s work. Allowing these pieces to be copyrighted would be a disaster for artists everywhere and would effectively kill their entire industry.
