While I feel like AI image generation has potential as a resource, the unfortunate truth is that it is not ethical in its current form, without regulations.  The images AI is trained from are often pulled from the internet without artists&#39; consent, and recognizable aspects of those artists&#39; work show up in the AI&#39;s generated images.  Some AI are trained on specific artist&#39;s artwork in order to replicate their style without the artist&#39;s consent.  Many people who generate images with AI claim the work as theirs, without crediting the sourced artists at all.  Even if an AI generates seemingly unique images, it was still trained on artists&#39; copyrighted works without their knowledge or consent.  So, I believe that AI image generators should only be trained on work in the public domain, or on creative commons (amd similar liscenses) works with credit.  Emphasis on credit.
