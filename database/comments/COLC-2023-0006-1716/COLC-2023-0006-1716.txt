AI not only steals jobs from artists it does so by copying existing art. Credit must be given to the artists the AI is trained on, it must be done with the artists&#39; consent, and artists should be compensated for having their work used for training. Websites should not be able to just decide that every piece of art or photo on their site can now be used to train AI, it must be opted in to and not hidden in terms of service
