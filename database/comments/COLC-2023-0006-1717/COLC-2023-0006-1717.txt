Generative Artificial Intelligence has been built on the creative works of individuals across the internet without permission by infringing on their IP and copyright rights. Both graphically artistic and literarily artistic works have been stolen and fed into AI as it exists now in order to have it create artwork at the behest of those who have no interest in the time, energy, and passion it takes to make those works. Because generative AI is based on stolen work, it should not, no cannot be copyrighted, as it is little else but an amalgamation and approximation made from countless stolen works without thought to compensation or fulfillment of copyright requirement.
