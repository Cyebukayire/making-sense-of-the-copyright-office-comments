As we all know, AI pulls from multiple sources to blend into a &#39;new&#39; creation, but with that comes the discrediting of many artists and writers. AI is harmful for our workforce and rights if it is not regulated accordingly. People deserve credit for their own works and recourse when their copyright is abused. I have seen first hand this effect on students in my university. AI has an issue with authenticity front and center and I strongly believe without parameters the U.S. will fall behind in multiple aspects.
