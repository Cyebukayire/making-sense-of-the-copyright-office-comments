The process of training an AI which will generate anything at all involves feeding it reams of data to sample and learn from, in the form of examples of things it might generate. In the case of artwork, this means thousands upon thousands of creations of human artists.<br/><br/>If a website, or game, or any other computer product &mdash; or in fact any product at all &mdash; presents artwork to its consumer without express consent of the artist, that constitutes theft of intellectual property on the part of the developer. I would argue that training an AI to generate artwork without express consent of all the artists whose work is being used as training data constitutes theft in the same way &mdash; especially given some generative AIs&rsquo; tendencies to often fully reproduce one of the pieces in its training set.
