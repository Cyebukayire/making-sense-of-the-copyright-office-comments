I am not a professional artist, but I am concerned about how the big players like Midjourney have obtained their training data. Was it obtained from willing participants, or did they just pull from publicly available sources and call it a day? Until we are absolutely certain that AI training data has been obtained from willing participants who have been compensated for its continued use, I am not comfortable with AI that can generate images and video. Similar thoughts extend to AI that can generate text.<br/><br/>The recent copyright rulings where AI-generated artworks failed to obtain copyright protection due to their derivative nature feel correct. However, I would like to see legal protections for artists whose work was scraped for their training materials. Additionally, I would like to see a legal obligation for AI developers to provide an easy way to see if one&#39;s work has been scraped for training data and an easy (and legally binding) way to request removal from the dataset.
