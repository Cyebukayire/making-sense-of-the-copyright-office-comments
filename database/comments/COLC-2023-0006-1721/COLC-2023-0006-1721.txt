Note that the &quot;Large&quot; in Large Language Models (LLMs) is quite the understatement. Large for many of these LLMs means nearly the entire output of the human species on a topic. When deciding how to treat the output of LLMs under the copyright law, it is fair to say the model output is always infringing on some human&#39;s work, somehow. As such, setup a way for these models to pay all humans for their infringement at the time of infringement, that is, whenever output is generated. LLM output that is used in anyway for profit should generate revenue for all humans proportionally to its value.
