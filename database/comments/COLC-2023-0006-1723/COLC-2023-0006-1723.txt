Please regulate AI and AI creations. AI depends on mining data and hard work from individuals, and that line can turn into a very slippery slope if it goes unchecked. There should absolutely be a limit on what AI can take to learn from, and there should be ramifications if an individual or corporation attempts to profit from AI-generated work - that AI-generated work was inherently stolen from other work done by human beings, and corporations should not profit from stolen work. Allowing AI to go unchecked and unregulated would be a disaster, and the internet would soon be rife with AI-created work. AI art in particular is extraordinarily harmful, and requires blatant theft of work that is already inherently unappreciated. There must be a limit as to what a corporation is allowed to do with AI. The inherent theft it requires will lead to a distillation of enthusiasm and discouragement within the creative community and will lead to a serious media drought, which will in turn affect the overall happiness of workers throughout the nation.<br/><br/>Further, websites should not be allowed to require your work to be mined for AI. There should ALWAYS be an option to opt your work out of AI collection, and with the normalization of AI, the ability to opt-out will be the first to go. This cannot be allowed. People should always be the first copyright holders of their creations, and allowing AI to steal from their creations will negate that inherent copyright.
