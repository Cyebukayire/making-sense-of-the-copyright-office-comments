AI should not be considered an author or co-author of any work, as AI programmatically combines and regurgitates content from other works and does not add anything creatively without user input. An artist&#39;s work should not be used without their permission and compensation, as an artist&#39;s artwork is a culmination of both hours of their labor as well as of study to reach the level of ability they have at the time of creation of the artwork.<br/><br/>A Human author&#39;s contributions to the work should be more than 80% to consider the work itself as something made by the Human author, firmly assuring that the AI generation was used as a tool to help in the creation of the work.
