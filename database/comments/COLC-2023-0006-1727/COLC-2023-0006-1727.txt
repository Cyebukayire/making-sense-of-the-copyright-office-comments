&quot;AI&quot; is a misnomer.  It&#39;s just a tool that looks at existing works and copies what someone else did, either in form or substance.  Just as any author who copies another work, that copying either needs to be cited, credited, and/or compensated.  Works created by AI are not original, and should NOT be protected as if they are.
