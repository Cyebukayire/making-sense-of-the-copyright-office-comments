Copyright should protect artists and creators of all types and allow them to benefit from their own work. This seems bedrock to me.<br/><br/>I do think AI technologies will have a place in the creative process, but what sort of place is one of great concern to me (and I think to a great deal of other artists/writers/actors/etc.). All the most prominent AI companies currently rely on datasets that are built on images and text taken without permission, and much of the hype seems to be around the idea of getting rid of the human in the process. I think this raises questions about copyright infringement already, just based on laws that currently exist, and I certainly do not think the opt-out programs being offered by some AI companies are enough. Either we have control over the work we make or we don&#39;t, and opt-IN datasets (at least for for-profit enterprises) seem like the only ethical solution to this. That may mean less powerful AIs, but, well, tough. It would probably be profitable to copy and reprint the works of Stephen King at a steep discount without his permission, but if such a thing were legal no one would ever be able to write -- which is why we have, well, copyright.<br/><br/>I also applaud the recent decisions in the US that stated that copyright only applies to works created by humans. That seems straightforward and hard to argue against.<br/><br/>I think we&#39;re at a crossroads here. Either we have a culture with art created by humans, or we move ever closer to a culture where we have content created by machines. As powerful as AI is, it is far from human. It is currently, in fact, far from even being intelligent. This may seem a little philosophical, but stories and art are how humans make sense of the world. We should be very, very cautious about turning that responsibility over to a fancy text autocomplete.
