AI-generated works are not &quot;creative&quot; works. They were not created by a person. They should not be granted the protection of copyright because no creator actually made them. It would be a perverse misuse of law to reward people who sat there hitting a Random button for hours, producing infinite &quot;content&quot;, over people who have actually used their skills and creativity to CREATE something. <br/><br/>AI-generated works are derivative works of whatever they were trained on. Fine for personal use, for brainstorming, for reference. NOT fine for commercial use. It should be considered copyright infringement to commercially exploit the output of an AI generator unless you owned the rights to all of the input it was trained on. AI output trained on purely public domain material is not infringing, but the output remains public domain and must be clearly marked as such, free to use for anyone who wants it.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t want all the AI tools shut down. People should be allowed to play with them and have fun. Getting a database to produce a made-up sequel to your favorite book is amusing and should be fine to do at home just for fun - but NOT to turn around and sell. <br/><br/>Restricting their commercial use is important not just to protect all of the creative industries but to protect the future of innovation itself. Relying too heavily on algorithms that can only produce mangled reproductions of the past prevents us from moving forward.
