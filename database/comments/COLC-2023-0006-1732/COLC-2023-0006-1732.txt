Artificial intelligence, as it stands now, only functions and exists as a matter of mass copyright infringement. We have heard time and again of artists alive and dead whose work was used against their or their estate&#39;s will, and without their knowledge or consent. If individual artists are to continue creating the visual and written works on which their livelihoods depend, they must be confident that their product is unencumbered by instant duplication and intellectual property infringement. New AI models must be created wholecloth from regulated databases, and artists ought to have pathways to claim and remove their intellectual property from these databases. Furthermore, AI work cannot and should not be copyrightable, as its basis is not in intellect, but pattern recognition and duplication.
