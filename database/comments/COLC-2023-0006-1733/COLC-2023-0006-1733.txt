I am not even an US citizen, but I am terrified about A.I as a creative, and because US have a monopoly on the internet. I plead you to give regulations to A.I who steal people&#39;s work who use their hard earned time and creativity to work. If A.I could be copyrighted, organizations would abuse it and a lot of people would loose income, lot of them my personal friends.
