AI is not creation, its is the re-arranging of existing material created by humans. Anything resulting from AI generation is nothing more than stolen images or writing. Copyrighted material is created by people, not machines. Do not allow AI to be considered copyrighted material, not is it morally wrong, it will have a catastrophic domino effect on the entertainment industry.
