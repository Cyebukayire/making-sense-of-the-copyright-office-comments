Hello, I&#39;m writing to express my belief that using &quot;AI&quot; models that are trained on other people&#39;s art without their express permission is theft. I think anything made with AI should have to be transparent and disclose how they were trained, and that AI-generated outputs should not be eligible for their own copyright claims, because more than likely they are violating someone else&#39;s.
