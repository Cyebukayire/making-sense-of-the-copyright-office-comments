The current state of ethics in the field of AI is a bungled mess of abuse, invasions of privacy, and chaos. There are no rules beyond what the AI companies themselves decide to follow, rules that are presented vaguely and could allow these companies to get away with anything not already illegal. Issues surrounding copyright violation are but the tip of the iceberg of a very large problem where institutions are simply allowed to do whatever they like to gather data.<br/>Copyright violation is the canary in the coal mine that got people talking, but it is by no means the only issue present or needs addressing. The use of copyrighted artworks as part of Stable Diffusion is simply another instance of AI researchers and companies acting as cowboys and treating data as nothing more than their toy to play around with to make cool things with. The fact that the teams behind Stable Diffusion and OpenAI made the products of their research so easily available to the public without regard for present artist industries on the internet further shows that ethical concerns are secondary to the advancement of the field.<br/>Any solution addressing copyright and copyright only will not fix the underlying issues, but instead band-aid over the most visible issue and still allow institutions to get away with clear ethical violations. A general regulation on the gathering of data is what is needed, defining in clear terms what can and cannot be done in gathering data and providing clear methods of investigation and recourse by anyone.
