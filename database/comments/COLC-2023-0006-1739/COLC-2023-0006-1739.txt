Hello and thank you for this opportunity.<br/><br/>As an artist watching the rise of AI generated content, whether that be voice, music, video or images, I have found it personally disheartening and insulting to the hard work we put into our art. While I have no issue with the idea of AI itself (in fact, I feel that if utilized correctly it could assist us artists as well, but nevertheless), in it&#39;s current state it&#39;s being used by both regular people and corporations to try and make us essentially obsolete, which we certainly are not.<br/><br/>I personally wish to get into the art industry, specifically animation, but with the way AI has been used to essentially replace us I don&#39;t feel as though I&#39;ll ever get that opportunity and many other artists have been feeling the same exact way. Our livelihoods and dreams are being squashed the longer this goes unregulated and I fear that if something isn&#39;t put into motion to at the very least regulate AI there will be dire consequences in the future for both artists and everyone else as well.<br/><br/>Admittedly I am unsure on how it would be regulated, though I&#39;m sure the other people who have commented here have given way better ideas than I can come up with. This is also not to mention the detrimental effect AI has had regarding information on Google and potentially other browsers as well, which could lead to mass information spreading or worse.<br/><br/>Anyways, I feel as though I&#39;ve said all I&#39;ve been wanting to voice. I hope that something is seriously done about this because as I mentioned above, this will not lead into anything good should this continue. <br/><br/>Again, thank you for the opportunity and I shall leave this here.
