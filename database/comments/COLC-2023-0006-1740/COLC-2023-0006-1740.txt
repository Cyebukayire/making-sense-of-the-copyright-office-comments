I have found that the use of artificial intelligence, in regards to copyright, almost universally violates existing laws and agreements to protect artists and their works. AI takes the literal image, writing, audio, or even likeness of an artist and uses it without giving any credit. Full books have been used to &quot;train&quot; AI without the author&#39;s express permission, and then others use that AI to make money without any credit or portion of the earnings going to the original author. AI used without explicit permission violates copyright laws and denies artists access to any money made by the software that stole their works in the first place. Regulations upon AI are necessary to continue to uphold copyright law and to protect American artists.
