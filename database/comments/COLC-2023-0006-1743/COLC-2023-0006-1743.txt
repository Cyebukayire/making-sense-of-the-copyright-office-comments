While I think there are potentially useful applications of learned language model text and model-generated artwork, I think the current models built on unethically sourced content, in clear violation of the copyrights held by the original creators of the works, is the &quot;poison pill&quot; that destroys any utility these models might have had. Until models are ethically built, and the use of them a required disclosure (for example, articles must say &quot;llms have been used to generate part or all of this text&quot;), and the acknowledgement made that these model-generated creations are not art, cannot be copyrighted as art, and have no place being treated as a replacement for art (but rather as a supplement), there&#39;s no way llms and art generators can be allowed to grow. It&#39;s my opinion that the current existing models need to be destroyed, and replaced by models built using ethically sourced datasets. Consideration of legal ownership rights and human decency of not profiting off them unethically, thus driving them out of work and credit, is tasteless and purely soulless money grabbing and short changing the public, not doing anything for the economy when those people are out of a livelihood.
