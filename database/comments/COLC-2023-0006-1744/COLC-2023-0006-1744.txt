Generative AI programs that are used for writing, image generating and voice replicating can&rsquo;t actually create anything without first being trained directly on the work of uncredited, unknowing and unpaid artists, writers, voice actors, singers, photographers and designers. Thousands of professional artists in all of these fields already struggle to find steady work with decent pay while having their labor devalued by the companies who hire them, and the proliferation of generative AI tech only further empowers these companies to pay low-level professionals even less than before &mdash; or replace them altogether with this tech. It&rsquo;s fundamentally unethical for this generative AI, which is only capable of doing what it does because it scraped and replicated the work of non-consenting human creators, to replace the very workers it stole from.<br/><br/>While this technology exists and increases learning from input, people will continue to use it (whether for recreation or to fulfill a commercial need), but refusing to grant copyright to these works would be a huge step in protecting the people whose stolen work made that tech work in the first place. From personal experience, I am a freelance comic illustrator who has been working in the comic industry for over a decade and have been honing my skills as a visual artist for over twenty years. It is already a struggle as a semi-established artist working in this industry to ask for a decent wage in my contracts with different publishers and companies, and to have my work devalued and have to wait for months-late payments from my largest professional clients. Immediately when I saw this generative AI tech become more popular on social media, I knew it would be used to devalue and replace the work of my colleagues in both the visual art world as well as myriad other creative fields. In the system under which this country operates, companies will always, always pay their workers as little as possible, and there is almost no protection for freelance artists in my field especially. Thousands of artists have had their work (which they created through decades of practice and labor) scraped and replicated without their consent, and the people who scrape and replicate that work with this tech should not be allowed to profit from it or hold any ownership of said stolen work.<br/><br/>Furthermore, in the case of image-generating AI programs like Dall-E, MIdjourney, etc., there is nothing stopping users from uploading images from wherever (and OF whomever) they choose at any moment. Since there is virtually no safeguard from a person&rsquo;s likeness being fed to these programs, the products made by generative AI programs should never be given the protection of copyright, and users of this tech should not be allowed to monetize or hold ownership over these products. I would also like to draw your attention to the risk of adult visual content being created by AI users who have access to countless photos of minors through websites like Facebook and Instagram. What protection are minors being given in the case that an AI-user feeds their photo to one of these programs and creates unlawful materials with it? If any person&rsquo;s photos are taken from their social media account and used with AI to create adult materials, how are they supposed to find any recourse &mdash; especially if AI users are allowed to copyright the images or video that this tech creates with their stolen likenesses?<br/><br/>If our government truly purports to value a free market and any semblance of meritocracy, the people within the legislative branch should protect the intellectual property and labor rights of the people whose work has been scraped and replicated by this tech &mdash; not those who wish to profit even more off of our stolen work.<br/><br/>GenAI presents many ethical problems on several different fronts, but I believe there is one huge way to cut down on the proliferation of disinformation, the theft of intellectual property and years of labor, and the destruction of entire industries of careers: do not allow AI-generated works to be copyrighted and profited from!
