Artificial intelligence programs used for art of all mediums, including writing, are created by aggregating creative works that have been made by real human beings. Many of these programs have been trained on works that the real creators have not approved the use of. Even if the programs are using works that were approved of by the creators, there is no real human being involved in the creation of AI-created work beyond what was given to the program as reference. Therefore, it is my strong belief that these works should not be protected by copyright, as they are stolen and/or highly-derivative works. People who did not create them are attempting to copyright and profit off of these works. If it is not legal or morally acceptable to claim an illustration created by another person without that person&#39;s consent and transfer of ownership rights, it should not be legally acceptable to copyright a work created by AI. I believe this both in the sense that it is created from another human&#39;s work, and in the sense that the human user of the program themselves did not create the work and therefore does not own it. My firm believe is that an AI-generated work is either the intellectual property of the artists that the program was trained on or of the program itself - as a program is not a human being and cannot hold a copyright, it is clear to me that AI-generated works being submitted for copyright are inherently fraudulently claimed. I believe that allowing AI-generated works to be copyrighted will do real harm, and this damage has already begun to be seen in illustration communities who are no longer receiving inquiries from potential clients. I strongly urge that copyright claims of AI-generated works be soundly rejected.
