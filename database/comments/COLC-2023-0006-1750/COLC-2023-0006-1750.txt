Tech companies and the tech innovation ethos has a policy of destroying things first and asking safety questions once there&#39;s nothing left but ashes. Art is created by humans. The point of copyrighting art is to protect the financial interests of the human creator. Machines are simply not entitled to copyright protections because they have no personal financial interests to protect. Only the creators of that AI would financially benefit. Why should any human or entity be able to profit off of artwork they didn&#39;t create when the creators of these AI systems often can&#39;t even site &#39;where&#39; the AI &quot;learned&quot; to &quot;create&quot; that &#39;art&#39;? This is all feeling like a high end grift to repackage plagiarism as innovation. If the US doesn&#39;t firmly, boldly, and completely protect humans, it&#39;s citizens, from the most basic infringement of copyright we probably will beat China is this &quot;AI race&quot;. The burdens and cost of that victory will be paid for by humans,  People who require food, water, and shelter, while machines rake in more stolen cash for Silicon Valley. Copyright protection is for humans - People who need financial protection. The robots will be fine without it.
