I am all for Artificial Intelligence being regulated as they are trained on copyrighted work without permission and has already had a negative impact on everyday people. From art work like paintings and photography to written works like works of fiction and articles from established companies, AI just copies from those works. There are already smaller artists being affected, losing out on private commissions and having contracts canceled in place of AI generated works. Another concern about AI, aside from intellectual theft, is how this tool could be used to spread disinformation about serious topics concerning our government. There are already many clips showing how current and previous Presidents&#39; voices are being copied and used for laughs on the internet. Granted, many people can tell it is fake but as time goes on and AI gets more advanced, how are everyday citizens supposed to tell real clips and fake AI clips apart? Same thing for photography. In the span of just a couple months, AI has advanced enough to where average, everyday citizens cannot tell the difference between real photos and photography. Even if AI doesn&#39;t pose an immediate threat,  there needs to be regulations in place clearly labeling works as AI.<br/>
