While Artificial Intelligence is at it&#39;s mere humble beginnings in creation, the point of it&#39;s making is not to make it commited to becoming a human. A human touch is required for any artisinal creation to have soul, have feeling- and generating words to create something is not well enough of a human touch to consider applying copyrights when it is merely theft.<br/><br/>The AI is not creating, it is taking. When a human makes something, everything that we create has part of us and our lives built right into the precipice. At the centre of it all, we are the gods of the realms we create, if for the simple and core urge of making. To share what we make with one another and build off each other, in hopes of being seen, being heard, and enjoying something together.<br/><br/>Marketing and capitalism today tries to wash its hands of those who do the labour, who sing the songs, create the art, but without us, it will be a soulless husk. A never ending loop of disappointment, an incestuous cesspool of stolen art reverberating in the corridors of a robot that knows not the difference between why we make the line curved instead of straight.<br/><br/>All of this is to say: please understand that when your child draws a house and family, it is in relation to you and yours. When a robot attempts to take that art, there is nothing at the base intelligence it carries that would give any rendition any meaning. It has no home, it has no family. There is no joy in creating for it. But our children will remember not being encouraged to draw simply because a person put words in a generating machine so they would be forced to go to work twenty years too soon.
