I think machine learning is fundamentally a similar process to a human learning - seeing art and trying to copy existing works is how beginner artists learn, after all, before moving on to novel things. The same is true with AI art - it learns by trying to copy art during the training process, until it can move on to novel art in a live deployment. Banning the usage of copyrighted art in AI model training would be no different to banning the usage of copyrighted art in human artist training.<br/>Moreover, diffusion models, the currently most popular approach to AI art, essentially work through what can be described as a form of drawing - they start with noise and then apply basic image manipulation operations to that noise like sharpening filters etc. to produce an image out of the noise. This is similar to how a lot of human artistic processes work, in fact, using noise as a base for art is common when making things like textures. They cannot and do not copy and paste existing materials by their basic design.<br/>All in all, it&#39;s very similar to a human artist learning to draw by looking at what those who came before them did and trying to copy it before starting to draw on their own.<br/><br/>As for whether AI art should be copyrightable - I think a parallel to photography is the most apt. With photography, a human artist has to decide what to take a picture of, find a good angle to do it, etc. The resulting image is produced by a machine, but the work to get there is from a human. A similar thing is true with some (but not all) AI art - I would find it useful here to make a distinction between human-guided and non-human-guided AI art.<br/><br/>On one hand, you can have an example of a human coming up with a prompt, then tweaking it over many iterations to get AI art they like. They put in artistic work by both writing the prompts and painstakingly selecting images over possibly hours, which requires an artistic eye. They might also use an AI that takes an image as an input and provide their (definitely copyrightable) sketch of an image composition as an input to define the composition of the resulting AI image. They might also do image editing on the resulting AI art image to further tweak it to their liking. There&#39;s clear artistic labour in many steps of this process, and so even if the image is broadly speaking &quot;AI made&quot;, it clearly should be copyrightable.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you can have an algorithm that uses ChatGPT to create prompts which are fed into Stable Diffusion and used to automatically mass produce images. There&#39;s clearly no human artistic input here, and thus it should not be copyrightable.
