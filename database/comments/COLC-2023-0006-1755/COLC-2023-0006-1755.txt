For context on this comment, I work as a software development contractor at a Fortune 100 company and I&rsquo;ve been an avid user/expert on AI technologies since 2021 prior to the release of many of the modern Generative AI models including GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Stable Diffusion, and many other open source generative AI models.<br/><br/>That being said, I think you all have done the right thing in disallowing copyright on AI generated content, and I think this policy should remain in place for the foreseeable future, assuming no new laws are passed or court rulings made that grant AI personhood as it relates to content creation. As I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re all aware, there is precedent for these kinds of circumstances for copyright (Naruto v. David Slater et al.) that establish that a non-human entity that creates a work is not copyrightable based on US law. <br/><br/>So ultimately, the office made the right initial decision by not allowing for AI generated content to be copyrightable. Given this precedent, I don&rsquo;t see any reason to change this decision until future laws or legal precedent on AI are established within the US. Furthermore, an attempt to change this policy outside of any changes in law or legal precedent would likely be an overstep of the copyright office&rsquo;s legal authority and would likely lead to a cascade of legal/societal issues as a consequence of such an action for human artists and media companies that would likely do more harm than good with the blame for said issues lying solely at the doorstep of the US Copyright Office. <br/><br/>I think you all have already made a wise and tactful decision on this matter as it relates to your authority on copyright, and I wish to commend you all for your prudent decision-making on this topic.<br/><br/>So please just keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing and let the Congress or the Supreme Court establish the appropriate laws or legal precedent for moving forward on this topic.
