Generative AI images, audio, and writing are scraped from the work of real people. I see no reason as to why it should be allowed to be copyrighted, bypassing the ownership of the original creators. It would be like allowing bootleg recordings of a movie or TV show to be sold in stores with their own copyright separate from the actual work they copied. Regardless of being a combination of different images or audio or writings, none of it was created by the AI, only taken from living people.
