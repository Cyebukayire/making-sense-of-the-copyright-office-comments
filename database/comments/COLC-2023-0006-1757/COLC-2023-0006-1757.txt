I believe that AI art based off either uncredited or credited artists (defined as both people who write and/or draw) who never provided their art with permission is theft, and to claim that the new &quot;art&quot; is copyrightable, even if made with multiple artists unpermissioned works, is gross misconduct. Generative AI should be a tool used by artists to help quicken the process of creating art, not to steal from those who may even be unaware of their art being stolen. <br/><br/>It is my belief that those who steal artwork for generative AI and claim it as their own should be charged with penalty under the law on a case-by-case basis. One person who stole is much different from an entire company who try to claim that theft is copyrightable.
