Many who defend AI generation of content, including video, audio, image, and literary content, argue that it is ethical and excempt from copyright breach because the sources (regardless of copyright protection and ownership) is scraped from the broader internet, therefore the artists and creators in question &quot;consent&quot; to being viewed by others and by extension, &quot;viewed&quot; by AI.<br/>This argument is rendered obsolete by the simple fact that if theoretically uncopywritten works are available on the internet and available for use to the AI, anything the AI makes out if these works cannot be copywritten. Because the AI cannot transform works, only amalgamate them with no intention of transforming them or interpreting them artistically as a human person would, the AI is simply generating uncopywritten work from uncopywritten work. Therefore the AI, or owner of the AI, has no right to the generated output.<br/>Additionally, most sources that make up the AI training database ARE very much protected by copyright and have been fed to the database without the owner&#39;s consent or knowledge. It is unethical to strip copyright from creators baselessly and then hand it over to another person, as AI cannot own anything.
