One of the concerns with AI that i have run into is how copyright and AI work with voice actors. Recently voice actors have raised the alarm about how you can train an AI into sounding like the voice actor. Beyond the violation of privacy, automation of an industry, and the ability to ruin someone&#39;s career by faking their voice, it raises a question of who owns the material used to train the AI. Does a person &quot;own&quot; their own voice? If the model was trained using lines of a show, does the person with the copyright of that show own the training material? How would this work with international works (someone in America making an AI model that sounds like a japanese voice actor) etc.
