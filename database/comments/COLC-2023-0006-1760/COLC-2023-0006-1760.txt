I believe it should be illegal to train generative AI on copyrighted work. Any creative work that AI generates is drawn from a source, or corpus of text/images. Any content it creates comes directly from those sources, though it may be cobbled together from many data points. But it does not cite its sources or offer credit, and that is plagiarism. If the artists did not consent their copyrighted work to be mined for generative AI content, then that is theft. If there is no way to credit or pay the artists who created the &quot;data&quot; that generative AI is trained on, let alone ask for the rights to use their work, then those who use AI&#39;s generated &quot;work&quot; are committing theft. There is no substitute for human perspective and creativity in art. At best, AI can only mimic that. Please protect the work that artists have dedicated their lives to to enrich ours.
