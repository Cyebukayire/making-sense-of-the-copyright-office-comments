All artists should receive a portion of the money generated by the AI software company that uses the artists&#39; work to inform the AI-model to produce &quot;original&quot; works of art. AI is useless without input, and the input is the labor of the artists that came before the software was created. Therefore, whatever money is generated based on the AI should be apportioned back to the artists&#39; from whose works were used by the AI to generate art.
