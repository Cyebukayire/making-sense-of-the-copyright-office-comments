I know that there are a lot of loud and uninformed voices out there and I just want to raise the point that these do not represent the majority and that legislation must consider and hear the latter. Decisions also should not be made to merely benefit current megacorporations, which I think is a real concern given past actions.<br/><br/>What is needed at this time is not to protect companies to dictate how their outputs are used but rather protection against their monopoly over creative work.<br/><br/>While many express wanting to protect eg &quot;artists&quot;, the fact of the matter is that most produced &quot;art&quot; are assets, and their rights belong to corporations, not artists. The narratives around this appear odd and uninformed.<br/><br/>As someone who is familiar with the technology and its applications, I must warn that even modest regulations may have rather drastic effects on competitiveness, GDP, and can lead to the further concentration in the hands of a few companies that have no issues circumventing the same. While it may be counterintuitive, less strict protections around how material is used is what will encourage innovation, and any modest regulation can lead to countless attempts to restrict from large corporations. I also warn that all mediums must be considered, as if the same restrictions that may seem sensible with it comes to eg art or music was to be applied to text or data in general, it would cause the modern technological landscape to implode. Even something relatively innocuous may lead to other applications such as ChatGPT becoming unfeasible. Depending on what regulation is made, many companies may also simply move operations elsewhere or outsource to reap the same benefits.<br/><br/>I think there are too many that only want to focus on the negatives of technological progress while ignoring to see the many positives and the many problems that can be solved by it and further economic growth. This is the greatest opportunity for it and there are many other nations are not going to set it aside.<br/><br/>I also believe revenue is mostly made either by providing value to society or through branding. With the former, no protection is needed - what is delivered is valuable in and off itself, and being able produce more is only better for all parties. In the case of branding, while some companies may need to protect their brands, it is mostly overstated with little revenue lost that is not ultimately due to value competition, and so the ones who will benefit the most are still the rights holders. This idea that somehow you should get a portion of all value that someone can produce by building upon your previous works, does not seem to exist or is not particular relevant in our society.<br/><br/>I think some regulation may be needed but it must not be pandering or misinformed. I think it must consider how this technology can go badly. How society could be dysfunctional after it has adapted to the new status quo.<br/><br/>With no regulation, it could be such things as - highjacking and copying of anything newly created, spamming of content, producing illegal content, influence campaigns, etc.<br/><br/>I think the latter are likely handled by other agencies. On the former, I think the protection is relevant and regulation against wide-spread training does not help to alleviate it, since that part can be made with unregulated material. I think perhaps what one should consider is to make sure that whenever something new is created, it has a period of protection against obvious copy-cats. This should apply no matter what technology is involved.
