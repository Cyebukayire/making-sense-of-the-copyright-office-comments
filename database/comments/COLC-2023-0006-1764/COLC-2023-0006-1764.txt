What are your views on the potential benefits and risks of this technology? How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, technology developers, researchers, and the public?<br/><br/>Considering there isn&#39;t a single AI-model so far that isn&#39;t based around the theft, education, and hard work of thousands of people, no matter the field it&#39;s being applied to, whether that be the arts (written, visual, or audio) or the tech (code or program writing), and also considering that any work of these generative processes still requires hours of editing work by humans before it can be applied to any commodity makes AI vastly cost-consuming. Given that copyrighted work is also used in these data dumps also means that, by law, anyone caught using copyrighted works (either art or tech) face the scrutiny of current CC laws which heavily restrict derivative works that do not fall under research, education, or parody clauses. Therefore it is also vastly more expensive to use AI. For copyright owners, they will now have to scrutinize any AI product to see if their property is being used illegally, for technology developers, they would have to triple check every single line of code spat out by an AI program before seeing if anything it generated could actually be useful (so far, from what I&#39;ve heard the code &#39;creating&#39; AIs are very good at bricking programs. This is a negative thing.) Researchers in no way need an AI to do their work for them. I cannot for the life of me fathom why a researcher would you use a GENERATIVE PROGRAM in any capacity. There is no ethical way to use an AI in the field of research. For creators, being unprotected from AI just means their creations can and will be stolen from them. Again and again. And used to make worse shallow imitations. AI, so far, is nothing but a generative program and an illegal scam bloated like a goose destined to become foie gras.<br/><br/>2. Does the increasing use or distribution of AI-generated material raise any unique issues for your sector or industry as compared to other copyright stakeholders?<br/><br/>I would recommend reading through the current demands of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA unions. Protection from having their entire careers stolen from them by the illegal use of AI is a pretty high priority requirement that is currently being refused by the AMPTP, I believe. Don&#39;t quote me on the acronyms. I work as a logistics member of a Target in the MidWest. I draw, write, and do a little voice acting, as a hobby mainly. I would love for my hobbies to be able to pay for my bills but while my the legitimacy of my hobbies is currently being stolen by some scam artists with programming degrees, and an unseen force in Africa (ie ChatGPT), then there is no opportunity for me to even consider these opportunities.<br/><br/>
