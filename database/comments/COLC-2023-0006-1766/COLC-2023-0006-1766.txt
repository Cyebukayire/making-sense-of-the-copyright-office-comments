AI art and content should not be copywriteable. It is work generated by an Intelligence that does not have a government over its choices or results as it is made from trends and based on the work of others to create its outcomes. AI should be used as a tool to improve our work and lives not a replacement for people. If this is allowed we will end up leading to a dead end of creation and imagination as they will be commoditized and take the human out of humanity
