Artificial intelligence generated content is interesting. Because it is an abstract generative process, that is made and trained from other datas. To the extent and level of copyright and patent applicability of AI produced content, unless a group can prove that their AI was exclusively created on their own training data that they have license to, and has no other inputs from non-licensed sources, following a tree of source based evidence, intellectual property cannot be extracted from AI generative processes and operations. If an image was created on stable diffusion, a common generative model, somebody could not copyright that image as their own, not because a machine made it, but rather because the information that was used to train that machine was not theirs. Generative content has a place in our incredibly broken and tormented IP structure. But only to the highest and most rigored standards of traceability and proof of ownership of all datas that were used in the synthesis of the generated content. In terms of patents, competitiveness must be kept and reserved to the general population, otherwise a single group could create a patent generating program, and create more documented, disclose, or patent pending ideas and other novel creations than any human could in a lifetime. This is inherently unfair. We must give both human ingenuity and absolute stupidity a chance before computers can create a beneficial product that others get to hold license on. The simple way to ensure fairness with generative content, in most all instances, is to consider not applying any copyright or patentability to any product, process, service, content, or other generated forms, that provide and create an explicit benefit to human existence and or enjoyment and or beneficial factor to and or for and or of life and or existence.
