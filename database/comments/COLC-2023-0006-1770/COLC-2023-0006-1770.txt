In my humble opinion,  AI generated works do not deserve to be copyrighted. They are a direct hodpodge and remixes of existing works, done to an uncanny degree. Whilst artists and authors spend their lifetimes studying and honing their craft, AI directly steals it and attempts to remix it using prompt data. Until the day machines themselves can have an original idea and execute with styles they&#39;ve learned , they cannot have anything copyrighted. In addition,  this could lead to mass abuse of the copyright system to attack pre-existing works just like the YouTube media platform.
