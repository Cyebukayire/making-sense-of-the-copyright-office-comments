Anything that incorporates material generated by AI should be uneligible for copyright protection of any kind, and companies that train AI with copyrighted material without consent should be prosecuted for infringement. AI does not create, but rather compiles from the material it was based on; put another way, everything an AI puts out is ultimately composed entirely of work made by people who are uncredited and uncompensated for what amounts to the use of their work. AI is incapable of independent creation, as it lacks consciousness, and even if what it generates bears no meaningful resemblance to another work, it is entirely composed of elements of other works, if remixed by an algorithm. The compilation process itself is based on the material the AI was trained on - its entire process is about replicating the works of people who often do not consent to have their material used for such a process. All content put out from AI is ultimately the product of a human creator, and copyright law should treat it as such. But because of the sheer volume of material that AIs are trained on, it is likely impossible to track down the humans ultimately responsible for AI-generated work, and thus such work should be completely inadmissable for copyright protection. It is absolutely unacceptable for companies or individuals to be able to copyright work that isn&#39;t theirs, and the work generated by AI doesn&#39;t belong to the one who commissioned it. Allowing AI-generated content to be admissable for copyright creates opportunity for rampant abuse; it is absolutely essential that restrictions be placed on this technology before it causes serious harm.
