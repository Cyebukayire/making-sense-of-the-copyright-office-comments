I&#39;ve already had friends who do art for a living have to go out of their way to find any possible way to keep their art from being scraped by ai in order to create terrible ai art. I think its ridiculous that there are people who want to claim what ever art their ai spits out as something worthy of intellectual property when it was taught on art that was owned by other people who actually own that art and are not being informed or compensated for its use. They do not create anything with ai art. It&#39;s like someone going through a museum and stealing art pieces so they can copy them and smash them together. I would greatly appreciate having the copyright office create regulations on such things. The emergence of ai art has created an environment that is hostile to actual artists as they never know if their art has been scraped for some bot until its already been done and there isn&#39;t anything they can do about it afterwards.
