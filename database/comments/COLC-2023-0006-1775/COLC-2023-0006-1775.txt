While I do truly believe in the &quot;Fair Use&quot; application, I don&#39;t see how AI creators can use Fair Use since it is not acknowledging the original creator&#39;s rights (esp. in the case of artwork). <br/><br/>In fact, AI seems to completely infringe on everyone&#39;s rights including writers, journalists, scientists, authors, voice actors, actors, illustrators, artists, musicians, etc. and uses it to create income.<br/><br/>It purposefully steals existing copyrighted material and plagiarizes even more. If the Supreme Court can rule against the Andy Warhol Foundation (2023 ruling) for his reworking of Prince&#39;s photograph then I don&#39;t even understand why we are entertaining AI as it currently stands. I believe it can be a useful tool eventually but there must be stringent protections for copyrighted material. Otherwise, why should copyright even exist?<br/><br/>We have already seen incidents where this is taking place. Whether it&#39;s an author begging Amazon to shut down unauthorized AI books published in her name (https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/10/tech/ai-generated-books-amazon/index.html) or an artist whose work is being copied and sold w/o authorization (I have seen this innumerable times the last few months), there needs to be intense guardrails in place and that is the job of the copyright office and the government.
