My former job laid off at least fifty writers and put the burden of the work on their editors because of AI. They thought that it would be a good idea for increasing company profits, despite all of our customers insisting that we write without AI and specifically requesting that we checked to make sure that people weren&#39;t using it in place of real writers. It was a way to undermine our work and cut costs at the expense of workers and customers by offering lower-quality products and work. None of our work was copyrighted in the first place; if people want to own copywritten material but don&#39;t want to write it themselves, they can and should hire a ghostwriter. It&#39;s a profession that has been around forever. We are very good at what we do and at emulating style. When people risk copyright violations using AI when they could just hire someone to create completely original work, it shows that they don&#39;t have a very high opinion of the writing in the first place, and that they will break copyright law the second they get the chance because they don&#39;t believe that intellectual property should exist unless they are the ones that own it.
