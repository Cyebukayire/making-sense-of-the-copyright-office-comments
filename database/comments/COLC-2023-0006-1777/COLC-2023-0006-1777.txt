As a long-time reader and lover of art, I must say that I do NOT consider AI generated images or text to in any way be anything more than plagiarism - every pixel of an AI generated image and every phrase from AI generated text is taken not from the true creativity or inventiveness of a person but from a pool of (often illicitly) skimmed material. I don&#39;t think that people should be able to sell or make money off of AI generated material, and they especially should not be able to copyright claim it. I don&#39;t think AI generated material is able to speak to any real expression of the human experience because it is so divorced from the person &quot;generating&quot; it through phrases and other prompts in an AI generator. There&#39;s also a real disregard for the technical aspect of art, the training and the practice that artists put into their work. And even if an untrained artist made some piece of artistic expression, it&#39;s a more genuine form of creation than an AI generator, where the person&#39;s effort is going into playing with levers on a machine they didn&#39;t create that is fueled by material they likewise didn&#39;t create.
