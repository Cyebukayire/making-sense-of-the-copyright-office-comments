Ai illustration should be classified like art thief, fair for fun and new artists to learn, not for reappropriating as one&#39;s own work for clout and definitely not for commercial use. Even if the AI art is not used as the finished product, using in in the development of a finished product for commercial use should be banned, with legal rights going to those whose sources were used. If AI art is posted online, sources or a directory of sources should be provide as research, and artist or companies should be able to request the removal of such sources they own to be used by AI sources. Artists should be able to opt in to this process, but they cannot be, by default, opted in and need to than opt out.
