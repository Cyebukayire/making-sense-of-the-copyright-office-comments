AI doesn&#39;t create anything. It takes pre-existing works and combines them until they resemble something (slightly) new. When this happens in music, we call it &quot;sampling&quot; and the creators of sampled works are entitled to credit and protection--AI is just an elaborate work-around. If we do not place rational limits on AI and its use, it will destroy the vast majority of creative careers while contributing nothing to humanity.
