Hello, <br/><br/>Thank you for opening this public forum on what has become a very sensitive subject, particularly where it concerns matters of human art and creativity.<br/><br/>I&#39;ll keep this as short as possible, as there are countless others who are more knowledgeable about the exact specificities of why Generative Artificial Intelligence (or Gen-AI) poses a threat to various creative circles, but I do stress as someone who enjoys human art and their varying modes of expression: <br/><br/>In this conversation, I am on the side of the artists. Furthermore, I am in favor of stronger guardrails for the use of Gen-AI and increased copyright protections for artists of multiple mediums (graphic art, music, filmed media, etc).<br/><br/>I do want to express that I understand that AI (in its current form) as a developing piece of technology will not go away; I&#39;m well aware that stronger protections and regulations will not necessarily stop its advent. This is not my intention, anyhow. Nor is it the intention of most in the artistic community who are advocating for these protections. <br/><br/>What I and others demand is the assurance that the proliferation of disruptive technology (such as Gen-AI) is not going to crush the livelihoods of those who contribute much to the creative cultures that have not only shaped who we are as humans but how we see the world, and most importantly: each other.<br/><br/>One other note: artists have historically been among the first (if not THE first) groups of people who have taken emergent technologies and not only implemented them into their creation processes, but have made them accessible and attractive to the general public. <br/><br/>It&#39;s a secret hope of mine that one day, we may reach a point where AI can simply become another tool in the artist&#39;s toolbox, as digital art programs and computer tablets haven proven to be in years&#39; past. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, we are not there yet. Gen-AI/Machine-Learning currently sits in the hands of some of the worst groups of people. Scammers, grifters, con artists and outright thieves alike. Disseminated not by actual artists or innovators, but by venture-capitalists and tech billionaires who see Artificial Intelligence as the next gold rush, with little to no concern over who gets hurt in the process. <br/><br/>To put it simply: so long as the narrative of AI is controlled by those whose only end-goal is ill-gotten wealth off the hard work of people who often never see a percentage of said wealth, it&#39;s only fair that we raise our voice and audibly demand limits (even full-on restrictions) to Gen-AI&#39;s uses. An overreach is an overreach. <br/><br/>AI is the new wild west and it&#39;s time to bring some order and structure.
