AI content can be extremely dangerous to creators and everyday people alike. AI can allow for the stealing of everything from art style to voices for monetary gain of another. This is akin to if I stole the mona lisa, then sold it as my own work. It&#39;s not something I created, and it&#39;s not mine to sell. AI can also be used to replicate other people&#39;s voices. This means that if I voice acted for a movie, then someone else can use my voice to put in their own works without my permission or knowledge. No one wants to live in a society where they have to be afraid to speak.
