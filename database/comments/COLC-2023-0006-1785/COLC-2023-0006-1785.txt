Good afternoon, fine people. <br/>The issues of copyright and the training of artificial intelligence is still an ongoing debate, and it is unclear if it might even be feasible to resolve this issue in the next few years, as the concept of training AI agents using copyrighted data dives deep into the mysteries surrounding the phenomenon of complex neural networks. <br/>If we were to take our brains as an example, one might expect that someone who memorized the entire script and scenes of the original Star Wars trilogy might not get a copyright strike, so long as they do not share this information with others. In some sense, this could also be applied to neural network systems used by institutions and individuals. <br/>For this, I will propose the following: We could construct a more nuanced system of laws that would allow individuals or institutions to train their models on copyrighted data, and such models could be monetized. However, the user of neural networks that are run locally (that is they are being run on their own computers, rather than on some other computer accessed through the internet) must ensure that the content generated is not a direct copy of any content that a content creator might have made already, and that institutions which deploy such models on mass might need to take extra steps to make sure that copyright laws are being respected. <br/>However, models should at least retain their ability to copy styles and be free to generate content that has either entered the public domain, or have been dedicated to a more permissive license, though the exact details would have to be figured out by these users and merchants. Regardless of choices made, I hope this comment at least gives some perspective on what could potentially be done, and I hope you find it useful.
