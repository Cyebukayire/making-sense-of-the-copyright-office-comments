With the current direction that AI has taken I find that it&rsquo;s simply a way to abuse the rights of individuals. Most AI are not opt in and almost none of it has been sourced ethically. AI especially for art and writing has been sourced off the internet without consent and without providing credit or compensation. In the academic world to use writing in that way would be considered plagiarism. Not to mention that the continued and unregulated use of AI has been leading to spreading misinformation. Functionality of things like chat GPT has decreased and can be used to provide inherently false answers and information. Looking for images of famous paintings, normal references, and landmarks have started to be replaced with inaccurate AI generated artwork. It is getting to the point where it is making the internet more unusable and perpetuating untrue content. There&rsquo;s also no way to trace where images and content come from with the current way these system are set up. I don&rsquo;t think that AI should be able to be copyrighted because it is inherently stealing other people&rsquo;s work. Copyright laws are supposed to protect individuals intellectual property and companies who are using this technology and benefiting off of others should be required to pay them for using their individual content. Thank you for setting up this forum to be able to give comments on this topic.
