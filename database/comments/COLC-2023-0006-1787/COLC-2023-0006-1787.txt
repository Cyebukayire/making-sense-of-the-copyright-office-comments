AI must currently scrape data from other sources before being able to generate a result, this scraping means that the AI is not creating any original intellectual property of its own. It is re-using and reshaping the creations of others, often times without the knowledge of the creators. The coding for many AI is designed to scrape almost everything it has access to, without caution or care, and then searches for common patterns, thus eliminating outliers and minority representations in the content it will generate. This then sanitizes and limits whatever supposed creativity may be coming from AI.<br/>AI generated content should not be allowed to be copyrighted, as it is not original intellectual material. And it should be subject to restrictions, which limit its usage, what data it is allowed to scrape, as well as other concerns as time goes and on its usage leads to the discovery of more issues with its existence.
