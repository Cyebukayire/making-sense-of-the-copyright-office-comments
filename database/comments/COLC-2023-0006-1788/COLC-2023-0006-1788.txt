As an artist the unregulated nature of a.i. Technology threatens my livelihood. The use of human made works of art in the training of these programs, often without the consent of the original artist, should be considered a violation of copyright. A.I should have no place in the professional art world yet it is threatening the jobs of many artists from illustrators, animations, and concept artists.
