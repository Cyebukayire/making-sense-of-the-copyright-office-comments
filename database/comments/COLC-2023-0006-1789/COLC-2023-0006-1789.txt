While AI can be used efficiently, using it with the intentions of not paying workers, using it as a tool to harm others, or using it to belittle the arts is not efficient. You can ponder the question &quot;what is art&quot; or &quot;what is ethical,&quot; but at the end of the day, using a tool not as an extension of creativity but to destroy and tear away creativity will only cause long term problems. The arts are needed, the arts are important, the arts tell the stories of humanity and the endless thoughts of their minds. The arts connect people, tell history, create bonds. You cannot take away the person from the art; it will only cause a decline of culture.
