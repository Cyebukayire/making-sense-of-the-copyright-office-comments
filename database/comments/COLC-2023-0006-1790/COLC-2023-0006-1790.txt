AI in the use of art has been everything but good over the past year or two, sending many freelance artists without jobs. Many have had their work stolen and pumped into companies that do what they want with the work of others, without any sort of credit, let alone payment to the artists they stole from. AI has greatly discouraged many people from doing the things they loved to do in the past, as it put fear in them that they could be easily replaced with AI. This not only includes writing, but art, as well as actual people. There are many arguments that people use to say that Artificial Intelligence is a tool that can be used to create, however, that tool is stealing the information of other people&#39;s hard work and not even polishing it into something original. However, when a human being has laws against plagiarism, artificial intelligence can get away with the theft of others&#39; hard work, scraping it down to its bare bones and only changing a little at a time without the consent of those whose hard work has been stolen. It&#39;s somehow deemed okay that we condemn plagiarism of human hands, but not the very same thing from machines BUILT by human hands.
