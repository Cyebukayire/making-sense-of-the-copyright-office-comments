 I am a professional artist for a career. I think AI should be be able to use all copyright material to train with complete impunity. My reasoning for this is because this is EXACTLY how humans do as well. I have fans make fan art or write fanfiction based on my characters. I have been told many times by fans that my work inspired them to go make their own. And, my own work was inspired by my childhood in the 1980&#39;s. Shows like Star Trek, books like Stephen King&#39;s works, and movies like Friday the 13th, have all influenced my works. As long as an AI is not specifically giving away the precise content for free (for example showing off the entire movie or books or other copyright works) but rather using those items as a means to &quot;inspire&quot; it, that is, to learn just as humans do so that it can create NEW works from information it gleans from existing works, then it should be fine. It is not copyright infringement because it is behaving exactly as any human would, learning material, and using the material to create new things. The only line should be drawn, as I said, if it is simply giving out the copyright works for free- which is the exact same as if someone gave out copied Star Trek episodes for free. To limit AI is to render it fundamentally useless as a creative tool, and it should be governed exactly as any human is in regards to copyrights.
