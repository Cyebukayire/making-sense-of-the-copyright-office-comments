Alo,<br/>I probably don&#39;t understand all the ins and outs, but if I create something, then it is mine, right? A company couldn&#39;t use it in their training material without my permission, nor could they advertise or sell pieces of it within their &#39;own&#39; content. I&#39;m not clear why that&#39;s any different for an AI. I believe the people who setup the AI do own the AI itself, but they need to purchase (or receive) permission to use someone else&#39;s work to &#39;train&#39; the AI. An AI cannot understand or learn (the name is a misnomer, isn&#39;t intelligent; it just repeats what it&#39;s fed like very fancy search engine), so any work an AI produces is a mix of the programming and the content it received. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any original content in what an AI produces either, since it&#39;s just random repeats and copies.
