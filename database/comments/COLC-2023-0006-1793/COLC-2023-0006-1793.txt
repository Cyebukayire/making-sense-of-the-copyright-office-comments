I believe that the use of ai should not be able to create copyrighted media (art, characters, tv shows, movies, etc) or be able to use individuals intellectual property (writing, photographs, art works) in order to train the ai. systems that have already scrapped artist&#39;s intellectual properties should have to wipe the software and restart with specified public domain works.
