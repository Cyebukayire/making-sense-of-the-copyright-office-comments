AI and machine learning models should abid by the same policies already in place. If they draw inspiration or use a piece of media, it should be cited and kept in the public. The issue is that AI and machine learning models are regurgitating work from other people as it&#39;s own ideas. It would be better if AI/MLM cited their sources and allowed authors/creators to opt out of their work being used as training data. And if AI/MLM are trained on open source work, than any output or anything created from it should also be kept open source. In summary, if AI/MLM want to use copyrighted data, they should have to either get permission or give credit to the original creators. This keeps the interests of both the private and public in mind.
