I have found that, for non-commercial applications, the use of AI can be of great help! As a table top role playing game player, like Dungeons and Dragons, the current waves of AI tech greatly enhances the experience. Not only can I generate character art for characters quickly and easily using image generators, I also use Chat GPT as a writing assistant, helping me generate random loot tables, generic Dialogue for Non-player characters, and names for characters and places. While I personally like these uses, the negative impacts of AI on artists all over means that the current laws won&#39;t work. AI can be ruinous for artists who would have gotten work, I really like the use of it personally for places where a human artist would never have been hired, like my games. But, if the quality of my game needs to be slightly lowered, to make sure artists get their due, it&#39;s more than worth it to heavily restrict their use.
