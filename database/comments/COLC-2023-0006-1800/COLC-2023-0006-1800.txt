These programs are intellectual property theft machines. They depend on being &quot;trained&quot; with large bodies of work that their programmer wishes to emulate, and most often this is done by scraping art, photos, music and prose off the internet, with no respect or regard for the creator or their intellectual property, in order to replicate their labor at no cost. Their creators and benefactors must be held to account for the thievery they depend on. If this stifles &quot;innovation&quot; and preserves the livelihoods of artists, writers, and other creatives then, in the mind of this citizen, all the better.
