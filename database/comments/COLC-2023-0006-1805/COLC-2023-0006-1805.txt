Hello! About AI images and copyright: I do not believe AI images or anything AI generated should be able to be copyrighted. 1) It&#39;s dependent on input from actual humans, many of which have not consented for their work to be used in this way. 2) AI generated content is not created by a human and thus is not intellectual property 3) Allowing AI content to be copyrighted would have a definite negative effect on any creative industry
