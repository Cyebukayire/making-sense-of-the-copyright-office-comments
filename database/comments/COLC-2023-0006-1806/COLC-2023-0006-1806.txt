There is a very large and very important difference between humans drawing inspiration from copyrighted work and machine learning algorithms copying copyrighted works. Machine learning algorithms (frequently called &#39;AI&#39;) should absolutely not be allowed to train on copyrighted works (unless the algorithm&#39;s creators hold the copyright, of course). The algorithms can consume more media than a human ever could, and their creations contain no truly new content or innovations.<br/><br/>By contrast, people must be allowed to continue to make new work that is inspired by copyrighted material. It would be extremely difficult to prove that a human drew no inspiration at all from any copyrighted work. Attempting to crack down on the work of humans would only give existing copyright holders a stranglehold on new media.<br/><br/>Please restrict machine learning algorithms but not human creators.
