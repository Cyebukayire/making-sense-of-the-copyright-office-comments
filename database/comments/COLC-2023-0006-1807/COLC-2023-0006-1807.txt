AI created works should not be copyrightable because they are not the result of a person or group&#39;s creativity, but instead the product of an algorithm attempting to mimic the look of creativity based off of a given prompt. AI writing/image generation/voice programs often make use of creative&#39;s work without permission to train the AI, so could in some cases be considered plagiarism
