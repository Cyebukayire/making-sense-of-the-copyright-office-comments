Generative Ai can be a great tool if used right, but right now artist&rsquo;s works are being actively stolen and mass produced. And it&rsquo;s actively damaging to us as artists. It&rsquo;s not about jobs, it&rsquo;s about our work being used for Ai without our permission. <br/>It would be like if parts were stolen to build a machine. The machine was created, but it was made using stolen parts.<br/>I&rsquo;m actively against Ai being used in a way that uses other works and images without permission from the original owners.
