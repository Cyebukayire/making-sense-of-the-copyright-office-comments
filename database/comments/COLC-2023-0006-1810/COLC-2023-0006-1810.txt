AI should not be able to be trained on copyrighted works and should only be allowed to be trained on content that has submitted for that purpose or given explicit consent (not hidden in terms and conditions but has checked a box on each post [or something similar] saying they&#39;ve given their consent). AI is detrimental to all creative fields, from illustrators to investigative journalists, and must not be allowed to use people&#39;s skills that have taken years to hone without credit and proper compensation.
