I believe AI should not be given copyright. AI can only be created on by training on art/works of others and this can often and easily lead to the theft of other people&rsquo;s work. Additionally, with the writers strike and everything, I think giving AI copyright would be an ethical violation and insult to workers. In terms of precedence, there was a case in which a monkey was not given the right to receive copyright for his selfie because it lacked standing to sue for protection and another group. It stated that because it was &ldquo;not human&rdquo; that it &ldquo;lacks statutory standing under Copyright Act 1.&rdquo; I believe AI falls into this same &ldquo;not human&rdquo; category and should therefore be made to follow such precedent.
