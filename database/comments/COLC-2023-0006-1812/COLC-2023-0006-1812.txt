AI generated works should not be eligible for copyright protection. Copyright is meant to protect human creations. If a monkey can&rsquo;t hold a copyright, then neither should a large language model. Giving a copyright for AI generated work is akin to giving Google copyright to your emails or Apple copyright to your text messages due to autocomplete and autocorrect.
