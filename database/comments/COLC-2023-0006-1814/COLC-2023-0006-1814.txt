After reading what this office hopes to achieve, here are my thoughts:<br/>With regard to using AI as an assistant, it should be recorded a) that an AI and which AI program(s) were used in developing a work and b) in what capacity the AI program was used (ex the user just typed a prompt into the program and called it done vs a game developer focusing writing most of a game&#39;s script and using AI to give the NPCs a variety of background dialog lines).<br/><br/>As to whether a work resulting solely from an AI program after entering a prompt, these should not be granted the same copyright as something created purely by a human. With how quickly AI can generate text, images, video, etc, it would be so easy for bad actors to generate as much content as possible with the intent of suing anyone who happens to create a similar piece of work. It would be like people who apply for patents with the intent of making an unsuspecting inventor to have to pay them for their idea just because they have a logged patent, but no work to show from it.<br/><br/>The US and the world as a whole is not mentally or politically ready for AI work to be granted the same protections as human work. Better to put a stop to it now and reassess in the future as AI&#39;s role in our society becomes more defined.
