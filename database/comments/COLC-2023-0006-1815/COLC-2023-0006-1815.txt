I&#39;m a full time, self-employed freelance artist and am so disappointed that &quot;AI&quot; has been allowed to get to this point. Not only does it threaten the craft of all artists, but steals from them in order to compile an image. There&#39;s no intelligence, AI is nothing without stolen data and images from working artists, living artists who live in the real world. I would be more accepting of it were it trained on an opt-in basis, that paid artists accordingly. In it&#39;s current form, it&#39;s nothing but an ethical violation, a copyright nightmare, and should not exist. It&#39;s just a new thing to inflate the tech hype machine until the next thing comes along, but in the meantime it&#39;s affecting real people. Even image searching for references lately, more and more images pop up that have been AI generated. There are no tags, nothing indicating that it&#39;s been faked, so on top of it violating artists copyright, it also leads dangerously into potential misinformation campaigns.
