I firmly do not believe that AI-generated works should be protected by copyright. <br/>I work for a media company that runs a number of high-profile websites focused on various topics -- think tech news, financial advice and so on. This company recently attracted news coverage and controversy when members of the public noticed that a number of our articles were written by AI and also contained errors. I was among the staff instructed to produce these articles using a proprietary AI tool.<br/>When this outcry happened, the company put all production of AI-written articles on pause and reviewed all existing content for errors. I was frankly relieved when this pause occurred and hoped that production of AI-written content would never resume. In addition to the potential damage to reader trust, and the difficulties of producing usable content with the AI software, I had serious concerns about potential plagiarism.<br/>Here&#39;s how the tool worked: You enter a headline containing a keyword. The software scrapes Google for the keyword&#39;s top results and pulls in subheadings from the articles in the results. Then, for each of those subheadings, the software essentially repeats the process (or the software&#39;s user can manually choose articles to pull from). The software summarizes these competitor articles, then uses those summaries as a knowledge base from which it produces a &quot;new&quot; article. <br/>The software is incapable of producing new insights the way a human writer could. It doesn&#39;t draw on years of expertise to pull in surprising related facts or generate useful advice. All it can do is regurgitate and rearrange facts that were already present in the source articles (which it does not cite in any way, and which it occasionally plagiarized wholesale). While the software had a mode that was supposed to produce more &quot;creative&quot; writing, that mode was prone to hallucination -- that is, making up spurious information. <br/>The human editors were tasked with taking these rote articles and fact- and plagiarism-checking them. We also frequently rewrote significant chunks of the content to make it less generic and to add our own knowledge. If this material is copyrightable at all, I suspect it&#39;s only because of the human labor and rewriting that went into it. The machine-generated results were, in my opinion, entirely unoriginal.
