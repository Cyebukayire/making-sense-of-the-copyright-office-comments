I am a graduate student working in computer science and I am certain legistlative steps need to be taken to control datasets used as input for A.I. systems. Much of the Academic world only utilizes A.I. from datasets with explicit cleaning and oversight from the dataset creators. Not carefully assembled datasets can contain not just copyrighted works but personally identifying information, biased information, and even legally dubious content. To prevent further use of irresponsible datasets in the future legal steps must be taken.
