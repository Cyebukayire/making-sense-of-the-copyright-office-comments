Allowing AI to train itself based on copyrighted content and materials is an infringement on intellectual property rights. Especially where art, writing, and other uniquely human and creative subjects are concerned, AI can only copy those examples.  Therefore, especially where creative materials are concerned, not only is allowing the use of AI training on them an infringement, it is also morally wrong. Additionally, because AI is not human and cannot make human judgments based on the nuances of law or society, none of the work or materials created by AI should be protected by copyright law. As a professional in creative services, I know how important copyright and its protections are for creatives and the businesses who employ and use them. If AI is granted those same rights, it will not only endanger small businesses who rely on the unique talent of creatives, but it will effectively diminish the role of creatives in the workforce. This will then lead to higher unemployment across that demographic. Finally, where legal disputes are concerned, the party that used AI should have the burden of proof to prove that the work that was created was NOT created after mining data, content, or examples from the other party&rsquo;s copyrighted materials. Thank you for your time. In a rapidly developing world, we need to remember that we are still human, and to give AI rights meant for human beings is to diminish the talent, skills, and experience of millions.
