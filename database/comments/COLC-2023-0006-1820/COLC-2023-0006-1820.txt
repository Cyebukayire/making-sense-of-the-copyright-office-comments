I am a professional voice actor. I am vehemently opposed to generative AI being used to clone any of my biometric data including but not limited to my voice or my appearance, without clear, explicit, and verifiable consent from me or anyone else I give authority to (such as a family member.)<br/><br/>No corporation should be able to own any part of me on this deep of a level. It&#39;s one thing to own recorded voice-over lines or filmed video footage of me, it&#39;s a completely different story to own what is essentially my DNA.<br/><br/>Thank you.
