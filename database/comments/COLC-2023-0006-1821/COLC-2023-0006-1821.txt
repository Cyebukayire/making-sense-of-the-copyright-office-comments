I am a young freelance artist from Southern Illinois, and AI Generative Text and Images have been a huge detriment to my work and many others. The AI is largely trained on stolen work from copyright holders, and scrapped from across the internet without consent, and used to train AI for generating images and text based off of the data from copyright holders. <br/><br/>My work has plummeted in value, years upon years of working to get where I am has been ripped away and it is now impossible to live off of my work as no one will hire me if they can simply use AI to generate images that have been trained off of my work without my permission. I know personal friends and colleagues that have not only lost profit but been let go from the companies they work at because their workplace has switched to using AI rather than paying the people for the work.<br/><br/>They are wanting our work but are not willing to pay for it so they are scraping our data and stealing it from us instead. My commissions have dropped 80% in the past year. I have not been able to find work at all in the past 6 months in the career I&#39;ve spent so long working on.<br/><br/> AI not only impacts me negatively as a creator but as a consumer too. I am unable to hire people for projects anymore, I&#39;m unable to afford it. And am in constant doubt as it gets harder and harder to tell if the product I pay for is actually the real thing or if it&#39;s stolen work. I can not use the commercial rights I buy from artists and writers legally if the work is produced via theft and breaking copyright laws.<br/><br/>It is genuinely heartbreaking to see that something that once brought me stability and joy is no longer viable as a career because I am being out competed by technology. I have been an artist and writer since I was a child, and unfortunately my future family and the next generation as a whole will likely not have the chance to do anything like what I love to do at all. <br/><br/>As creatives we deserve to be paid for our work, and not be replaced by machines in a dystopian like economy. <br/><br/>Our jobs are being stolen by machines. - Sincerely a very passionate citizen of Illinois
