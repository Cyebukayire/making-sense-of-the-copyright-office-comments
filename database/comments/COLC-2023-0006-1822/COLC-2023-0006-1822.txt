Artificial intelligence is a tool that it is too late to ban. Nonetheless, now that it is here, it is important to regulate in the law, who is responsible for the act of creation when it is used. Indeed, when a user prompts some AI to create a so-called piece of art, no proof of originality originates from the user of the software. Indeed, it is the similar process as ordering a third part to make a visual result. In such case, the artist still own its rights to inalienable, while selling the rights to use the rights for its commercial use. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, with AI, the visual created is in reality a work of collaboration between the artists that have seen their works used to train the AI, and the AI itself that ingests all of these inputs with machine learning to create a new visual. One could argue that there is true artistic and technical originality in the AI techniques that are developed. BUT, it is but the equal of all the artists that have seen their work used. Then, the orignality of the art should be attributed to the AI company, and the artists themselves. In no case, the prompt user proves originality in the creation. It is but an order which is very different. <br/><br/>In reality, what happens is a complete violation of the precedently mentioned principle. Indeed, the prompt user can enjoy all the benefits from a commercial use of such a technology, the AI software fails to recoup all the value of this transaction, and most of all, all of the artists that were illegaly scrapped their art to build the database needed to create thousands of pieces are unfairly not compensated. <br/><br/>This is the biggest crisis of intellectual property. This is a threat for all artists, a threat to all media IPs, and a philosophical question to open on what makes an art creation. If you follow every principal of intellectual property that made today&#39;s art, and the protection of it, the current situation is an outrage that needs reparation as soon as possible.
