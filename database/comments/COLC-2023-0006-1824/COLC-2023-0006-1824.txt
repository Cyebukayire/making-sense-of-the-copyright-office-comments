AI should not be referred to as anything other than that which is it; plagiarism. Artists work for years to master their craft, and to have it blatantly ripped apart and mixed into an engine with a hundred others whose livelihoods have received the same grim treatment, only to be slapped together in an over-saturated, melting pot of blatant theft, for the self-righteous &ldquo;prompter&rdquo; who has barely learned to string a few words together to be able to not only claim it as their own, but to even profit from it, is ABHORRENT. Please protect the art of genuine artists, and do not allow plagiarism to become a viable option for profit.
