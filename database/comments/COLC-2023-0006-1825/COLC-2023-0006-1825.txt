Hello, this is my comment on Artificial Intelligence and Copyright<br/><br/>Training Ai on copyrighted content without the consent of the copyright holders is completely unethical and it is a violation of human rights.<br/> <br/>Using the works of creators, artists, musicians or writers without their informed consent to use them for training Ai systems is completely unethical and is theft and infringement of intellectual property.<br/><br/>Ai training should only be done in an ethical and moral manner, using only licensed or copyright-free content.<br/><br/>Ai training should only be allowed through state licenses, and every one or two year checks should be done by appointed specialists (but not specialists appointed by companies creating their own Ai)who they willcontrol and check the training datasets for any copyrighted content in the training data without the informed consent of the copyright holders.<br/>Any violation they should be punishedpicking up license.<br/><br/>Content and songs generated by Ai should never have been given copyright because they were not created by humans. Giving them permission would be disrespectful to any artist or creator. Content and works that contain any elements generated by Ai should not receive copyright.<br/><br/>I have hope that the United States will show the world, very decisive actions to make the training of Ai moral and ethical and block all Ai systems trained on data theft.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my requests.
