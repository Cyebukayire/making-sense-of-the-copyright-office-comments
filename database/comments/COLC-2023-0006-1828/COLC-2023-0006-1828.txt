AI art, ai writing, etc. as they exist today are unethical. Most if not all AI generative programs on the market today scrape from sources all over the internet with no consideration for the original copyright owners. Artists&rsquo; and writers&rsquo; livelihoods are being impacted because now anyone can just ask an AI to generate a product that copies their unique styles/voices without permission rather than commissioning an artist or buying a writer&rsquo;s work. Actors are also at risk of their voices and likenesses becoming unwilling assets for AI to draw from and steal their jobs. Furthermore, AI that scrapes from photographs is stealing people&rsquo;s likenesses and is at risk of utilizing them for distressing purposes that the photographer or the photographed subject would likely object to (i.e. AI pornography). In non-generative pornographic content, there are ways of verifying performers&rsquo; ages to endure that only adults are consenting to perform. But how can anyone reliably confirm that AI pornography scraped from all corners of the internet isn&rsquo;t utilizing the image/likeness of someone who is underage? AI as it is currently being used is recklessly inconsiderate of consent, copyright, and (in some cases) safety. Regulation is sorely needed. Laissez faire AI use is detrimental to multiple creative and performing industries.
