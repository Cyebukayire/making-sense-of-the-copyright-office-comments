I think there should be strict Copyright laws against AI generated art and works. Having these laws would help protect artist and writers from theft and would also prevent the spread of misinformation.<br/><br/>Before the release of AI systems for public use, artists and writers had some protection against thieves on the Internet. Thieves would have to take or copy the entire piece or work/art, usually with watermarks and names attached, which made the counterfeits easier to spot by the original artist or fans. While this type of theft is still a problem and a hassle to resolve, AI&#39;s make this more difficult because they not only copy a piece of work, they copy an artist/writer&#39;s style or voice. A style or voice that has been refined for years by the artist or writer through hard work and dedication.<br/><br/>For example, what is stopping someone from going to an AI and asking it to write a story in the style of Stephen King, or to create a piece of art in the style of Picasso, and then selling that work as their own.<br/><br/> Furthermore creators of these AI systems did not ask the artists/writers permission to use their works to train these AI algorithms. Archive of Our Own, a popular fanfiction site that contains thousands if not millions of fan written works, was scraped for data to train the AI that makes up ChatGpt in December of 2022. The moderators of the site and the writers were given no notice, and only found out that the site had been scraped when volunteers noticed something amiss after the fact. Keep in mind, these writers create the works for free, while AI systems like ChatGpt are usually in a paid subscription.<br/><br/>AI&#39;s like ChatGpt are also notorious for generating fake data in order to answer questions. The lawsuit led by Mark Walters is a great example of this; in June 2023, ChatGpt produced a text of a legal complaint that accused him of embezzling money from a gun rights group. If NEWS stations and journalists rely on this type of AI to pump out articles at increased speeds, this could cause widespread misinformation.<br/><br/>Having Copyright laws against AI generated works or art is a must. It not only protects artists and writers that have been perfecting their style and voice for years against unlawful theft, it would also prevent the spreading of misinformation.
