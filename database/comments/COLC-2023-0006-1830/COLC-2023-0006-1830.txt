This is outrageous.  All you people need to do is actually try generating some images yourself.  You will quickly find that it takes lots of work to get AIs to generate what you actually want to see.<br/><br/>But, you argue, it&#39;s just copying the work of real artists.  So do all hip hop beats.  So does all satire.  So does all reaction content on YouTube.  So does every cover band.<br/><br/>The fact that old morons can&#39;t see these AIs as just another tool, like a hammer or paint brush, is beyond me.
