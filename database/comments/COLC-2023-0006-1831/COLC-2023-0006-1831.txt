Generative AI is nothing more than glorified plagiarism. It&#39;s been proven that the only way the technology learns to &quot;create&quot; is by literally stealing other people&#39;s original creations. Artists and animators, and now even voice actors, either are at risk or already have been losing their jobs and being replaced by a soulless machine. AI is not a skill that someone learns, it&#39;s merely feeding a system certain data to spit out a desired result. That is something that someone should not be able to copyright, because they had no hand in actually making anything. It is an amalgamation of other&#39;s hard work and genuine practice. People in college have also been shown to use AI as a means to cheat through their courses. People see it as an easy-out or a fast, lazy cash-grab. And when you realize that the AI is only trained based off of what it&#39;s fed (ie. the already developed work of other creators), it&#39;s unethical and immoral. It has continued to put so many livelihoods at stake and potentially stunts education if people are to simply fall back on letting a machine do everything for them. Nothing will get done, everything will be sloppy, and eventually the AI will cease to learn how to do anything new and the patterns and the messy, clunky, inhuman details will become more clear.
