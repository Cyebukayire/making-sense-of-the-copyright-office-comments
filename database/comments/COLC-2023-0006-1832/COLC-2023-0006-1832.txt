It is my belief that AI that uses copyrighted material to create AI-generated outputs should not be copyrighted. Fundamentally, this type of AI is using the content of other human beings, often without the express permission of those individuals, to &#39;copy&#39; the works of living or deceased artists. Copyright in my eyes is something that should only be granted at this time to beings with sentience, rather than computer codes that simply re-hash the creations of others.<br/>I believe for copyright to be allowed for a work, it must be a unique creation or addition to an existing property. AI is incapable of making something truly unique or creative as it is not creating original works, it is just using others works. I hope that makes sense, and thank you for your time.
