The lack of copyright protection for individual artists whose work is used by generative AI is unethical, exploitative and allows for their brands, personal image and in many cases, previous copyrights they already hold, to be violated. People should have the choice to contribute to AI softwares willingly, out of an interest in furthering the technology - not unknowingly, without their permission or against their explicit request.
