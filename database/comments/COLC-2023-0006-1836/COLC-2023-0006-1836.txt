The use of material to train AI should be considered fair use. The person who uses AI to generate something should hold the copyright to the output. AI shouldn&#39;t be required to be disclosed since no other tools or resources are required to be disclosed when making something new. It is no one&#39;s business how a creator creates, if they use AI, Photoshop, a thesaurus, or brainstorming with a friend it has never mattered and shouldn&#39;t.
