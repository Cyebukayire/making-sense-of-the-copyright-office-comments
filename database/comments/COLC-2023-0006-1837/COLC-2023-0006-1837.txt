I work as a graphic designer. I am against the use of unethically sourced generative AI for various reasons. 1) I don&rsquo;t want my work stolen and used for someone else&rsquo;s project and take credit for it. 2) job security for not just myself, but my fellow artists, designers, photographers. We are important too.
