I am a human artist, and my fellow artists and I suffer greatly from the impact of AI generated content. Our creations are stolen and used against our will by AI generation tools. I do not think that anyone, company or otherwise, should be able to take people&#39;s data or creations for use in an AI algorithm without their consent, and if consent is asked it should be up front with its wording and not in fine print hidden in terms and conditions.
