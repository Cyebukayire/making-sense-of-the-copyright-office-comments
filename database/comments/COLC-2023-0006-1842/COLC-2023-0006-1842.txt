The use of copyrighted works to train AI systems will give actual artists, actors, musicians, writers, DJs, set designers, directors less work. It is a net negative for our society to give creative jobs to computers while real people seek wages for making important creative work. I&#39;ve listened to AI DJs on spotify and it&#39;s a nightmare. I&#39;ve seen AI generated art. Some of it is beautiful, others disturbing. If beauty were our only primary goal, that would be one thing, but humans are gifted with ethics, values, and morals. If you think about the current WGA strike and AI for about 15 minutes, you&#39;ll start to see it&#39;s a power play by the executives to squeeze creatives out of their hard earned money, and give us even more watered down slop than ever before. Copyright won&#39;t stand a chance in the face of corporate greed.
