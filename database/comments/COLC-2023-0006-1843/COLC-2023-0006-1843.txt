AI and the people who shape it/train it do not take into account consent. They do not seek artist consent. They - frankly - do not want artist consent or artists for that matter. Artists are inconvenient human beings with rights and thoughts and stomachs and apartment rents... <br/>AI cannot deliver what an artist can deliver but it can* steal their work. And in the game of AI and unchecked corporate power - that&#39;s all the talent it needs.<br/><br/>The technology used to create AI could be so helpful - another tool in the toolbox - *if* artists had control over how it would be used and trained.<br/><br/>The use of AI right now breaches copyright and human decency and should either be politically forced to evolve or go back into the ass from which it came.
