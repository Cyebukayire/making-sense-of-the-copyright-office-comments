I am commenting only my personal opinion, as a lifelong patron of a variety of art forms like music, animation, portraiture, fan art, tattoo artistry, mixed media, and fine arts. I have a layman&#39;s understanding of machine learning tools like Mid journey and Dall-E. <br/><br/>I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to continue upholding the legal logic behind the two registration denials noted in 2022; plain and simple, &quot;art&quot; created by typing a prompt and pushing a button is not art at all, it is machine generated imagery. I do not believe that it should be illegal to use machines to create such imagery, but it should be illegal to profit off of that created imagery until and unless there is a mechanism in place to assure proper compensation to the copyright holders the models are learning from.<br/><br/>In the case of all the existing machine learning/AI tools that generate images, I believe the only legal remedy is to direct the owners of the tools to either disclaim to their users that nothing generated by these tools can ever be copyrighted since they are based upon copywritten properties, OR have the tools completely purge the current learning models that have been built upon open ifringement of copywritten works and re-build only using works that have been given written approval for sharing by the copyright holders. The duty to determine whether works scraped en-mass from sites like Twitter each hold individual copyrights should be a burden for the tool owners, if they wish to provide users images, text, sounds, etc that are intended to be used for copywritten/for-profit work.<br/><br/>The U.S. Copyright Office should stand with the artists who have already done the right thing and gotten appropriate copyrights for their works and seek to provide remedy from those who have stolen their works. Consumers and users of these tools also deserve to have a clear understanding that they cannot profit off of or copyright machine learning generated images, text, music, etc.
