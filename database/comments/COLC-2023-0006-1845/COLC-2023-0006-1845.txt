I&#39;m a small artist who is concerned with the fact that &quot;AI&quot; has already been used to take and use artists&#39; works without permission, consent, or notice, to generate new &quot;creations.&quot; The lack of clear rules and laws protecting these artists&#39; work from such use has seemed to legitimize this process. These programs do often charge fees for commercial use of the generated images, but the original artists whose work was used in this programs have no consent to the use of their works in that way, and are not seeing any amount of that cost the &quot;AI&quot; programs are collecting. &quot;AI&quot; programs need regulations and oversight to both prevent further infringement on artists&#39; rights to their own work, and to compensate artists whose works were already used in this way.<br/><br/>The focus of such conversations regarding &quot;AI&quot; image-generation should always center the concerns of the artists whose work make up the backbone of what these programs do. These &quot;AI&quot; programs should not be able to use data they do not have rights to, and certainly should not be able to profit from that data.
