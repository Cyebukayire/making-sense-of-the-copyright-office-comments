&quot;Artificial intelligence&quot;, as it exists presently in our popular discourse (e.g., ChatGPT and its fellow travelers) wouldn&#39;t exist if it weren&#39;t for flagrant ongoing violations of copyright. From intellectual property owned by the largest rightsholders to small, single proprietor art studios and graphic design contractors, AI programmers have gone beyond Fair Use and are actively hostile towards copyright, all in the name of &quot;machine learning&quot;. There are ways to train complex artificial intelligence programs without violating the law of the land, but those are complex and aren&#39;t fast&mdash;two things that are anathema to the entities behind contemporary AI implementation. As a private citizen, I cannot (and should not) violate copyright to further my own interests and goals. The same rules apply to software and hardware developers. I ask the government to enforce copyright statues to the end for which they were created&mdash;to protect creators and rightsholders.
