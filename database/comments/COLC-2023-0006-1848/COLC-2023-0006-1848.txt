Any work produced using AI should not be copyrightable. AI models are trained on the work of others, especially other copywritable material, and as such the works produced by an AI should not be considered new or unique or eligible for copyright. <br/>AI also damages the integrity of media consumption and production, and society at large is not adequately equipped to determine when something produced by AI is being passed off as an individual human&#39;s work or voice. It would be a danger to society to allow such works to be copyrightable.
