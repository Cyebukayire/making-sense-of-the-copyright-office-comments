The owner of the voice should have the right to choose if someone can use their voice, any voices they act for (i.e. the voice owner also owns variations, impressions and the like) and what the limitations of the voice usage is. If their voice is used, they should be paid for it. Perhaps not as much as usual work, but still, they should be paid for their voice.
