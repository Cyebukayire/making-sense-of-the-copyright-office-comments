I believe copyright law should protect works that are substantially human-created (not necessarily 100%), with minimal AI input. The use of AI editing tools (such as ProWritingAid or Grammarly) should have no impact on a creative work&#39;s eligibility for copyright. But I don&#39;t believe the copyright protection should be extended to creative works that have a significant amount of material actually created by AI (as opposed to edited with the aid of an AI tool). I understand that this may be difficult to track.
