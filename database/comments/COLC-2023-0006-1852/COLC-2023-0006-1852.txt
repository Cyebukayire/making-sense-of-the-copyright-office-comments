My written material, my likeness and my voice are my livelihood. They belong to me. They are what I use to make a living and support my family. Anyone, human or AI, who wants to use my written material, my likeness, my voice, or anything that belongs to me, for anything at all including machine learning or any other kind of copying or use in the known universe(!), MUST contact me personally for my written permission to do so. If I agree, we will draw up a contract. If I do not agree, there will be no contract and NO USE. Violators should serve jail time. The jail time should be severe and lengthy.
