At this time, AI as a &ldquo;tool&rdquo; depends on using data scraped and stolen from working artists and creators as reference. In most cases these creators do not know their work is being stolen and profited from. There should be methods in place to prevent and opt out of training AI data sets. Increasingly so, websites such as Deviantart, art station, and Twitter are threatening to automatically submit images(including artists portfolio work) to be trained on by AI datasets, and are hiding options to opt out of this behind difficult site navigation or extra forms. It should not be assumed that upon signing up for a website, that you are consenting for your work to be used in this way. The default should be that you are only opted in if you CHOOSE to be opted into training AI datasets on your work. I personally believe that there should eventually be laws either preventing major networks like previously mentioned from scraping this kind of data from its user base altogether, or at least preventing them from making the default option on their platform &ldquo;opted in.&rdquo;
