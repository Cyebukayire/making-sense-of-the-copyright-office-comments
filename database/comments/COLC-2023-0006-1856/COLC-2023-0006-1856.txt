AI software runs blatantly off of stolen artworks created by people who have spent many many hours honing their craft. The use and spread of AI created imagery under the pretense of it being art is unethical. It highlights the depreciated nature jn which the people value art. It represents the unethical commodification and exploitation of artists. Allowing it to continue to attempt to present itself as artwork is going to present terrible consequences not far down the road.
