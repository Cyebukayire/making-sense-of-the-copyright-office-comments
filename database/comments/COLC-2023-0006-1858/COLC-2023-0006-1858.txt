AI generated content should not be copyrightable. That should a right reserved for art produced by humans. Limiting AI use of copyrighted material will inherently limit other transformative uses such as collage or rap sampling. So the best way to protect artists from AI competition is by making AI-produced work non-copyrightable. Additionally, philosophically, the copyright in an AI generated work should be held by the AI, not the human who prompted it, but neural networks can&#39;t hold copyrights.
