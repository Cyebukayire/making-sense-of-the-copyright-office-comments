AI should not be able to copyright work, as it is in many cases stolen. Additionally, copyright is for humans. Copyright should also not be allowed in cases where AI writes the first draft of something (ie a tv show script) and humans have to rewrite it for lower editing wages. Additionally the usage of AI for that, or to supplement extras, or to use peoples likeness in other films, is extremely negative. That should not be allowed, or what the film industry should be about.
