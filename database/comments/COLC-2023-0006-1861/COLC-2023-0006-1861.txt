AI-created works should not be copyrighted or receive the protections provided by copyright. AI models are not &quot;intelligent&quot; and are trained to copy patterns present within the datasets, images, and other works created by people. AI does not create anything new or novel in the sense that all AI-created works are not a creation at all, merely an unintelligent mashing together of algorithmically related themes or elements copied from often stolen intellectual property. Even the term &quot;AI-created&quot; is inappropriate; &quot;AI-generated&quot; or &quot;produced by AI&quot; or more accurately reflects the outputs of AI models. AI tools could be compared to a search engine where a user inputs a set of words and criteria with certain results in mind. Should search engine users be granted copyright for the results page just because they put in the search? Absolutely not, that would be absurd. AI is materially the same. <br/><br/>I strongly oppose any copyright or other intellectual property protections for AI-generated works.
