Speaking as an educator, a fiction writer and as a person who studies personality formation, I am begging you to use all of the resources at your disposal to strengthen/sharpen both copyright law itself and the mechanisms of enforcement in a way that will cut off generative AI models&rsquo; ability to train and draw on copyrighted material. Quite apart from the question of monetary compensation to creators of the works being scraped for training, these generative models are stealing signature style and voice from individual creators. It&rsquo;s not just a question of whether (for example) artist X has lost payment for a commission to illustrate subject Y for someone who wants that thing illustrated in X&rsquo;s style; it&rsquo;s that artist X (and others) has lost the right to refuse. I do understand that parody and satire have always existed and are covered by fair use; but in prior technosocial moments, effective parody or commentary has required technical significant skill or perceptual insight (and often both) on the part of the person creating the parody or commentary. This is just one small slice of how generative AI&rsquo;s rapacious access to existing works harms both the arts and our wider intellectual culture. I strongly urge you to draw on the law in its existing scope to prevent training-set use of copyrighted AIs, and to create accountability for those who violate the rules against using it.
