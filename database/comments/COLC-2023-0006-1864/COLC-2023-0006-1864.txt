This is more simple than a lot of people are making it out to be.  If search engines are allowed to do what they do, then it should go without question ai should be able to not only create content, but allow copyright(to a human) if a human makes the prompt.  The technology is using examples of images/text/etc as training then(here&#39;s the key here) making it&#39;s own code to create the content based on what it has learned/seen.  Humans creating content are essentially doing the same thing;  Using prior examples of learned patterns to create their own content.  Having a machine do the same thing shouldn&#39;t matter, it is not making a direct copy of anything.
