Artificial Intelligence is developed off of stolen work where creators (artists, writers, etc) did not give their consent to have their materials used, even in a derivative nature. If these technologies had been trained off of consented content, this would be a much different discussion - unfortunately, this is not the case, and many people&#39;s works have been stolen to feed these machines. Websites that previously safely held uploaded art forced their userbase to automatically consent to their uploaded works being used in AI, eroding the trust between creator and observer. Many deceased artists had their content enrolled in these AI training models automatically, without any option to decline. This art was copyrighted by the creator, and the elements that made it up are now in use by AI.<br/><br/>A large part of art creation is the development of style - one can recognize a Monet by the brushstrokes, the choices made in color and composition - and although style is not copyrightable, it is sickening to have someone be able to automatically steal the elements that make an artist or writer stand out and then attempt to pass that off as anything other than creative theft. Feeding classics into a machine that spits out a Frankenstein&#39;s monster result does not make the person who fed the machine an artist - it makes them a tool user. They did not create any of the input, and therefore the results should not be theirs to copyright.<br/><br/>Thank you for allowing this conversation to be had.
