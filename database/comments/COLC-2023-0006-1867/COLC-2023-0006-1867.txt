We need AI protections in place so corporations can&rsquo;t use my face and likeness on more than one project than the one it was scanned on. I work on movies and if I&rsquo;m scanned those pictures shouldn&rsquo;t be used on another production Besides the one that it was taken on!!! A company can&rsquo;t own me and my face from now to infinity bc I&rsquo;m me and no one should be able to replicate me without my consent and if they do they should as Brad Pitt says in Killing Them Softly they should &ldquo; fucking pay me!&rdquo; It should be a substantial check too not . AI hurts creativity and we can&rsquo;t have an art industry like movies and tv be ruined by it.
