The idea that what ai art and writing can be copyrighted is frankly silly. Works of art that are scrounged together using the essence of works made by thousands of unknowing people both living and long dead. The process through with these images and texts are generated makes it impossible to copyright these works as they contain the physical and intellectual property of thousands of other human beings which would have to be identified and then share ownership of the work. This process also infringes on many preexisting copyright claims as seen in the case between Getty Images and Stability Ai, as various ai sources are refusing to disclose their sources because of this suit it can be inferred that all refusing parties and violating other copyrights and this should be denied the privilege to protect their pilfered images under the law. Attempting to claim ownership of these frankensteined images, text, and even audio, should be considered embarrassing as it is a violation of the legitimate ownership of the people who made each algorithm&#39;s fuel. There also is no relevant reason why legal ownership of ai pieces should be allocated to a person or entity, because producers had nothing to do with the creation of the work, the owners of the algorithm have little to do with it as well. While the code is interesting from a technical standpoint, the actual creation of ai media is a hands off process and thus lies outside of the realm of any human creator.
