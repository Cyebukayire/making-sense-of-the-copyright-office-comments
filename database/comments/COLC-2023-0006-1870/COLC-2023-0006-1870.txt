AI is basically plagiarism by statistics. The large language models are essentially predicting the most likely word to come next in a sentence, and they do that by looking at every bit of writing they can steal off the internet and remix slash mine for good stuff. The ones that make &#39;art&#39; are even worse, in that you can input an artists name and get back out art that looks remarkably similar to that artists published works. The thing is, none of the original writers or artists get paid for the use of their work in remixed outputs, which is a type of theft. AI outputs should NOT have the protection of copyright, as the original copyright holders didn&#39;t agree to letting their work be used as base material in these plagiarism machines.
