I encourage the study and advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) as long as all work used to train the AI was permitted to be used for training by the creator of the work. Artists, writers, and more, are the owners of the work they create, and they should be the ones that decide whether or not their work is used to train AI for any reason. Also, I believe that all intended purposes for the AI should be clarified for the creators when they are deciding whether or not to allow the company to use their work for AI training. AI cannot be given permission to create work for display and then also use that same work for sold merchandise if the creator did not approve their work to be used in that way. Companies need to be held accountable for their work, and they need to pay the creators for the use of their work.
