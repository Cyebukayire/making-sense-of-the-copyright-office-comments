I agree with your current ruling that a living human being must have direct control and personal involvement in the creation of original, copyrightable works. AI-generated content should never be awarded copyright. However, if a human being creates a detailed, original, comprehensive and sufficiently lengthy prompt, they should be able to copyright their prompt, but not the AI-generated output. Thank you for protecting the rights of human authors, artists, musicians, performers, etc.
