Any AI creation usually stems from another humans work. The AI looks at different artworks, stories, and even voice acting and then combines certain things to create something new. However, most of the creations are blatantly obvious in their theft of original ideas. The process of scanning each of these works is where the problem starts. It gives no credit to the original creator and allows for their work to be taken and repurposed without their acknowledgement. AI should not be granted the permission to to recycle original ideas instead of just creating something. That is what makes it copyright infringement. The AI puts the creators work into it&#39;s system and that takes the content and credit away from the creators who made it. It&#39;s clearly against the point of copyright, which is to give ownership to a concept that took effort to make.
