In the digital art landscape, AI tools have catalyzed an unprecedented wave of creativity. While some may superficially use these tools to mimic renowned artists, there&#39;s a burgeoning community of innovators, especially on platforms like Midjourney, who are pushing the boundaries of artistic expression. Beyond refining pre-existing designs, I&#39;ve harnessed these tools to conceive entirely new characters&mdash;ones that the world has never seen or imagined until brought to life through my creative prompts. These characters are not mere byproducts of algorithms; they are the culmination of my individual creativity, countless hours of development, meticulous selection, and refinement, akin to the role of a creative director in traditional mediums. Yet, our current legal framework remains oblivious to the originality and effort behind AI-assisted creations. It&#39;s crucial that our legal system evolves, recognizing and safeguarding the ingenuity inherent in both refining existing art and birthing entirely new characters through AI. genuine innovation, regardless of the tools used, warrants protection and encouragement.
