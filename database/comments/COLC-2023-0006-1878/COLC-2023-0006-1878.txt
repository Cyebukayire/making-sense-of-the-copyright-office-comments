AI, while it may seem like a &ldquo;new revolutionary&rdquo; thing, it&rsquo;s actually harmful to not only artists but also people themselves, <br/><br/>It&rsquo;s not numbers or someone behind the scenes, it&rsquo;s a literal computer that is try to learn how to take away the hard work people took ages to do, just one click and someone did an art piece similar to the Mona Lisa with no effort at all that doesn&rsquo;t even look right but is &ldquo;So Great!&rdquo; <br/><br/>Same can be said for voice actors, or just actors in general, instead of casting people or look-alikes you make a computer replicate one&rsquo;s voice without consent to make them say things they never would, or make actors appear that don&rsquo;t even wanted to be apart of the worst case is &ldquo;The Flash&rdquo; movie where literal AI replicated dead actors for the sake of a joke that wasn&rsquo;t even remotely funny and spat on the legacy of those actors, it&rsquo;s disgusting. <br/><br/>AI isn&rsquo;t an advancement in the industry, it&rsquo;s the straw that&rsquo;s breaking the camel&rsquo;s back, and isn&rsquo;t an excuse to replace actors and screen writers during the strikes either.
