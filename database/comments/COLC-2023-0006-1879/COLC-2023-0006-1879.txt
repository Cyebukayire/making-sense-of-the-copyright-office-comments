Artificial Intelligence is not a human. A human currently only authors a prompt, and feeds it to the AI Generator; nothing innovative, and no artistic authoring is occurring especially with AI generated images. If AI generated artwork is able to be authored by a human - the AI would need to be trained only by that human and the creators of the AI&rsquo;s own data and not stolen data scraped from the entire internet. That data is copyrighted by other authored artists, humans, and businesses. AI Generated Art is only a generator off of stolen data theft from public and private humans, entities, and governments world wide. <br/>AI generated anything is currently a disturbing topic from a few rotten individuals and companies trying to legalize something that is and has not been legal. It is a tool that has stolen from current living humans, and they ( AI companies ) do not want to be found guilty of their crimes. <br/>AI Generated content should not be considered for copyright and all AI Companies selling their AI should be held liable for all copyright infringement violations and prosecuted.
