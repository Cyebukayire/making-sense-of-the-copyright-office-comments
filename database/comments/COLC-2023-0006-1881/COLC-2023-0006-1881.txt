AI is harmful to artists, voice actors, musicians etc. Anyone in the creative field in general. AI feeds off the hard work of creatives and is essentially stealing from them. Freelance has become slower for creatives since AI took over. It is the reason why SAG AFTRA and WGA are striking. Background actors were told that their entire bodies would be scanned with only on day worth of pay while studios get to use their bodies for whatever they want without consent or pay. AI will replace people. This needs to be regulated.
