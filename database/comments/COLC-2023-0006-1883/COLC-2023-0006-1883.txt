Content that is generated by Artificial Intelligence should not be considered for copyright. Unlike art created by humans, artificial intelligence cannot express the level of creativity that a human can. Its generative nature also represents a danger to copyright holders, as it can be used within a context that prevents enforcement by copyright.
