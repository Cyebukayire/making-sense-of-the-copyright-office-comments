Ignoring the glaring evidence that prediction-based text generation will never amount to genuine human insight, it is positively unconscionable to allow entire industries (tech support, film/television, advertising, marketing, etc.) to be hemorrage jobs without any sort of oversight or new job training program. It represents a short-term cash grab by a reckless few that, if left unaddressed, will very obviously lead to a net-loss in overall useful production.
