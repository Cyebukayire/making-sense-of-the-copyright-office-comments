I believe Artificial Intelligence and its creations should NOT be eligible to apply for copyright. There are a swath of AI programs that source and steal content online from hardworking artists and their work with no recourse or consequences. A majority of artists are never informed that their work was used to train AI models, nor have most artist agreed to the use of their work in these programs.  AI users actively, knowingly use these stolen works as a basis to create &quot;original&quot; works but the very process of training AI requires the use of existing art to &quot;learn&quot; from, but cannot deviate from the original piece in the same way humans can. AI cannot be trained in the same way a human artist does,  it can not be inspired and create original works with respect to another work or primary source,  it can only manipulate existing works of art into a new arrangement. This is stealing. <br/><br/>I do not believe that images, writing, or other creative works created with AI should be allowed to be copyrighted, as it is not an original work created by a person. It is a regurgitated blend of many works stolen from unsuspecting artists and upheld as the AI user&#39;s  &quot;own, original creation&quot; when there was no true creation involved, only entering terms into the program and seeing what it mashes together from other artist&#39;s work. <br/><br/>In the future I do hope to see AI programs that are made to help artists, and that respect the creations artist make by not stealing them. I think there is room to make AI creation programs alongside artists; ones that artist consensually provide work for the purpose of training the AI. But until we reach this point, we cannot, in good faith, allow for AI creations to be treated in the same way human-made art is, and protections for human artists must be created. <br/><br/>Copyrighting creative works for the time being should be limited to purely person-made works, and not ones generated by AI programs.
