AI content is not copyrightable. The purpose of copyright is to protect the intellectual property of a creator - AIs are not creating, simply generating composites from other creators (which is already ethically problematic), and an AI cannot benefit from the protection of copyright. Corporations do not need any more shortcuts to generating wealth at the expense of others&#39; efforts.
