AI trained off of illegally-appropriated works by human creators who have not consented for their works to be used in this way should not be given the protections their datasets were denied.  Even if a specific instance of an AI is trained only off of legal and permitted datasets, the tools themselves have already been developed by using illegal datasets, often including work that has explicitly been disallowed for this use.  Until AI tools can be developed ethically and legally, nothing they create should be considered exclusive to any specific party, since they were made by denying other parties their own ability to grant or deny use of their own works.
