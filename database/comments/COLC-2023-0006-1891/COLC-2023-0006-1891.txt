I say AI generated items should not be viable for copyright. As the items and &#39;art&#39; produced by said ai can have wildly varying levels of input from the user and with how widely ai is used for an unimaginable amount of things and takes reference from unpredictable sources you never know what someone could be copyrighting. With how ai has been used to mimic peoples voices, faces, and even specific art already created with very little change it would cause more legal trouble than it&#39;s worth. Especially once you consider how image generating ai&#39;s have in the past copied near identical work, private medical photos (to the point that the doctor recognized her patients features), and to edit photos of young women to imagine them naked. If the referenced sources cannot be clearly seen or reviewed there is no telling where parts of it came from. <br/>Considering how many websites offer a free space to share their original or fan inspired works for free, how many people have admitted to feeding their favorite creators work into ai programs, and the fact that popular cloud sharing and saving websites have started hinting towards sweeping users files to add to their own ai programs. Any user could steal work that has already been completed by another creator (even directly ask the programs to copy that specific creators work) and claim a copyright on it because if you can&#39;t see the source you can&#39;t prove they stole anything even if that was the direct intention of their actions.<br/>Attached to this comment is a side by side image of two &#39;different&#39; pieces of art. The one on the right being the finished work the artist posted after an 11 hour live stream of it&#39;s creation from start to finish. The one on the left was posted by a user who posted their &#39;original&#39; ai art that was posted in the middle of the first artists stream. Being part of the same community the second artist claimed their art was stolen by the first artist and cited the fact that they posted theirs 5 hours before the first artist posted theirs (after the live stream) as their reason for believing their art was stolen despite the fact that the first artist was streaming the entire process and never checked their account. <br/>This is just to serve as an example for how much messier the situation could get if this situation happened on a much grander scale and the ai generated work was copyrighted before the &#39;referenced&#39; work was even completed and gave the creator no time to even figure a near identical copy of their work had been copyrighted. Especially if it involves a more well known or famous figure copying a smaller unknown creator. Or in a space where the original &#39;referenced&#39; creator wouldn&#39;t know about the copyright. <br/><br/>Not to mention the fact that copyrighting is to save the integrity and rights of someones original intellectual property. So what does it mean when the work is not the users original work, and their intellect was not used in the creating of said work
