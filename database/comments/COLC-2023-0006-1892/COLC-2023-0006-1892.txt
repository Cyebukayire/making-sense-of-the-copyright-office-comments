AI should not be valid under copyright law. Although AI has plenty of potential for good, if allowed to be copyrighted, it would be devastating for workers on every level, starting with creatives. People in the creative industry - illustrators, designers, writers, and so on - already struggle immensely to have their work be valued. AI would dillute that value, and provide studios an avenue to cut corners at the expense of hardworking people, quality, and ultimately the final product. AI is just an amalgamation of people&#39;s work - often without their explicit consent or knowing how it will be used - fed to an algorithm, and cannot be seen as a valid means to replicate human effort as it comes at the expense of actual people. Thus, not only should AI be strictly regulated, but it should not be allowed to be validly copyrighted as it will easily be exploited to further minimize human effort.
