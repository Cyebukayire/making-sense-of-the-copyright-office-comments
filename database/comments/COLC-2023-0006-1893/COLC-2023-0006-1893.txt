AI uses data scraped from the entire internet to create a product. By scraping the artwork of others without permission the users of this ai are stealing the works of all artists. Artists have been struggling to survive economically using their own skills. Not only are ai &#39;artists&#39; taking advantage of struggling, skilled workers they are also attempting to replace them. The &#39;art&#39; created by ai while sometimes visually impressive is always imperfect, uninspired, and soulless. As a computer program lacks all of the human emotion required to make purposeful and touching art ai &#39;artists&#39; not only spit in the face of the history of art, but in the face of the human experience.
