AI is the worst thing that ever happened to the creative field. It had allowed people to steal others art, change it with AI and claim that it&#39;s theirs because it&#39;s &#39;different&#39;. It has caused people to lose jobs, lose their livelihoods, and have to constantly fight to protect their creations. I recently saw someone created books using AI, and put them under an author&#39;s name to make money and the author had to go public to get them removed from Amazon and from her name, because of AI. I agree with District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell who ruled &quot;A work of art created by artificial intelligence without any human input cannot be copyrighted under U.S. law.&quot; Art, Books, anything creative, should be done by a person and only be allowed a copyright if done by a person. All of these companies want to replace people with AI, so they do not have to pay them a proper wage. Or, people want to use other&#39;s art, or writing - run it though an AI and then claim it as theirs to make money off of other&#39;s hard work and name. Not only should AI work not be allowed to have a copyright, if people can prove it was their work that was taken and changed using AI, those people should have an easier time getting said AI work removed from whatever platform it is on, and be allowed to take legal action against the person, if they wish to. A program is not a person, a computer is not a person. It does not have rights, it does not have laws to protect it, so it should not be allowed to have a copyright. Allowing this will do more harm to the creative sector, than good. It will make it legal to steal, because it was tweaked, and then allow that person to protect the work they stole. Please, do not allow AI work, especially creative work, to have copyright protection in any way. I already know so many people who are suffering from this rise in AI who are having their work stolen and used. This is akin to plagiarism, &quot;the practice of taking someone else&#39;s work or ideas and passing them off as one&#39;s own&quot;, is what AI does. Someone takes another person&#39;s hard work, runs it though an AI program, which changes it slightly, and suddenly that person claims that it is theirs? No matter how you look at it, it is stealing. Please, don&#39;t allow people to steal other&#39;s work, copyright it, and suddenly they have protection on stolen work that wasn&#39;t even created by a human. No matter how I look at this, it&#39;s a serious problem waiting to happen, and allowing this would only make things worse. Please don&#39;t take us down this path. Creators already have a hard time as it is, this will only make it worse.
