In short, AI created content (especially artwork) should not be eligible for copyright protection. AI art is theft, not creation. By typing words into a prompt an AI software steals copyrighted images, actual artworks online (that are copyright protected) and an artist&#39;s style. There is nothing to copyright in AI generated content because it is all sampled and stolen without permission to create an end protect that was created with no input from a human being outside of a handful of words. It&#39;s like building a copy of a car made of stolen parts and calling it a different, original idea. It&#39;s not original, you are just stealing other people&#39;s work and calling it your own. <br/><br/>If AI generated content is allowed to have copyright protection, then the purpose of copyright protection is redundant. Copyright laws should protect the artists who create the original ideas and concepts, not the people who steal them and slap their name on them. The same law that protects a painting created by hand through hours of hard work, should not apply to someone who types in words in a matter of seconds. Any art that is on the internet would, and currently is, at risk of being put in this situation.<br/><br/>Because it&#39;s machine learning, it cannot exist solely on its own. It needs images to sample and steal from to generate an end product. It can&#39;t create, it can only manipulate works that are already created.<br/><br/>Do not let AI destroy human creations. Do not give them copyright protection.<br/><br/>Thank you
