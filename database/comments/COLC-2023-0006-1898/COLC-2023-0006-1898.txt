As a librarian and search expert, I&#39;m very aware of the value of information in the context of its creation.  Citing sources is vital for research, and constitutes the basis of most scholarship: without reliability there is just a morass of opinion.<br/><br/>Allowing AI to be trained on copyrighted materials creates value at the expense of writers and artists who made them in the first place, without proper approval and compensation and without any way to trace sources. <br/><br/>AI-generated content copyright would both diminish the source materials and miss the point of copyright in supporting original creation.  It would also unfairly and inappropriately compete with new art and writing, drowning original work in a morass of derivative work.<br/><br/>If AI-generated content infringes on existing copyrights, the software manufacturers and users of the AI should both be liable -- the computer systems only do what humans program them to do.  They should also be liable for disinformation and misinformation if they impersonate humans, including mimicking authors and artists.
