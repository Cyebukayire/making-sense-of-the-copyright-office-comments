I strongly believe that AI needs to be restricted and regulated, both in situations of monetary profit as well as public sharing. I am a digital artist that works as a 3D artist and animator, so I will mostly be speaking about &#39;AI art&#39;, and it concerns me that AI generation programs can so easily steal artworks to use as training data without our consent or knowledge. Stable Diffusion claims to have AI work in a &quot;semi-similar&quot; way to a human&#39;s creative process, where it looks at images, &#39;learns&#39; and recognises patterns and creates a result based on the given prompts. However, I believe this to be a dishonest perspective of how these AI generations work. <br/><br/>Artists indeed learn from taking in references and learning from existing works, but it is the fact that artists are humans that creates the distinctive factor between us and AI. Imitation without inspiration is just theft. Unlike human artists, a machine cannot get inspired, and thus the works they create are disingenuous copies of the artworks in their database that they&#39;re trained off from. It doesn&#39;t &#39;learn&#39; and replicate patterns out of inspiration and a human desire to expand its skills, it only processes data given to it, data that real artists never consented to being used in this manner. If an AI generator is suddenly cut off from its database, it is suddenly unable to function at all, unable to create anything because it truly hadn&#39;t &#39;learned&#39; anything like a real human. That fact alone does a lot to prove that what AI does is closer to stealing than learning. <br/><br/>Allowing the open publication of AI works, both from profit and non-profit, threatens the livelihoods of independent creators, as attention and opportunities get steered away from them. As such, I believe AI works shouldn&#39;t be protected or eligible under copyright law when it comes to publications. Individual creators that post AI works shouldn&#39;t be able to attain copyrights to the generated image, and companies that make use of AI in their artistic assets, shouldn&#39;t be able to hold copyrights over that specific asset either. But beyond that, I also believe that AI images should fall under illegality, as it is essentially plagiarism based on my prior reasoning, especially when artists are unable to consent to their works being taken in this manner. Therefore, AI programs should be required to properly source and credit the artworks their images are trained from, and monetary profits made from AI works go to the artists whose work was used in the generated image.<br/><br/>In this way, exploitative and plagiarizing usage of AI can be regulated, while allowing the tool to still exist as something privately used and not for publication at the expense of others&#39; works. For example, artists who feed their own works into AI to publish the result are deemed acceptable, as they limit the database to their own works which they hold rights over. Another safe example is when artists use AI as a private tool to better help visualise drafts of what they want to create for themselves with their own skills and efforts.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that the laws will recognise the ethical issues of AI usage and protect the creative rights of artists who spend years learning their craft, over programs that have no creative rights to protect. The world will always make advances in technology, however, losing touch with the jobs and passions that involve the expression of humanity, individuality and creativity would only be a step backwards in &#39;advancement&#39;. There is nothing to gain, yet more to lose, if soulless programs take over such mediums of expression.
