AI generation should require transparency about where data is sourced from to produce its content<br/>data sourced from someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property should qualify as a copyright violation or require paying some sort of royalty if profiting from the AI generated content<br/>in the case of the music industry, AI generated songs that use the voice of an existing musician should have to give that musician royalties, people should own the rights to their own voice <br/>the AI is machine learning from their existing music and so the AI creator would have to pay for each song analyzed to generate the voice (similar to how sync/publishing license fees etc currently work in the music industry)<br/>This would also work the same for instrumental tracks<br/>AI affects the music industry as well as visual art with AI generated images, and AI scripts affect the movie industry, AI generated text affects writers across multiple fields<br/>AI generated images should be transparent about the images they source from to generate the image and any original artist/photographers used to source for AI generated images should be credited and given royalties or allowed to sue if they did not give permission for their content to be used for machine learning<br/>Same should be for writers or any sort of AI content generated for profit, the sources should be publicly known and the original creators serving as data for AI generation should be paid a percent of the profits and credited- if they give permission for their intellectual property to be used, if not, the AI generated content should be considered a copyright violation
