I, along with many other online artists, writers, and content creators in general, have long felt the press of AI data scraping, and have so far felt powerless to do anything to stop it. It&rsquo;s not until a company that houses one of the AI models comes under lawsuit do they even begin to admit the overreaching they have done into countless portfolios and people&rsquo;s personal data to train their AI models. I have long thought that the idea of machine learning and image generation tools can be extremely beneficial to artists, however the way that corporations have used this technology is not only invasive and exploitative, it comes directly at the cost of individuals who have little to no avenues to defend themselves (for instance, if an online artist is struggling to make ends meet as it currently stands with commissions, they don&rsquo;t have access to legal defenses that they would require to combat the theft of their hard work, artistic style, and loss of profits from some &ldquo;untouchable&rdquo; AI system that was trained off of their work without their consent). There&rsquo;s benefits out there to AI technology, however there are far too protections in place to prevent corporations and general grifters and thieves from using it against those who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of their passion.
