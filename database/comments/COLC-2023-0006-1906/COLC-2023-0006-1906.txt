If I spent a year learning about Tony Robbins motivational speaking methods and then published an informational paper about it, that would not be a violation of his IP rights.  Nor would my study of his methods, including accessing his website, be a violation of his IP rights.  Nor would my compilation of the paper on his methods with other papers on a site with a paywall violate his IP rights (as is the case with countless journal sites).<br/><br/>However, if I learned his methods and adopted them as my own, selling them in substantially the same form, then I would be in violation of his IP rights. <br/><br/>Thus, the issue is not the learning, but the application.  AI draws from information everywhere, just like an excellent reference librarian, professor, or topical expert.  It&rsquo;s absorption of content should not be a violation of IP rights, nor should providing an overview of that content be a violation.  The fact that LLMs are so good at such a variety of learning is not a reason to restrict their access to that information.
