AI-generated images should not be copyrightable, as there would no longer be a motivation to have professional artists create art. It would simply be cheaper to hire a robot to copyright a design, undermining the entire concept of copyright as it exists (to give artists monopolies over their vision). A company could train a robot on a professional artist&#39;s style rather than pay them, totally eliminating the need to pay masters at their craft.<br/><br/>The concept of copyright itself is violated by the idea of having a trainable robot that can create copyright. Copyrighted works could be trained upon until any person has a machine capable of replicating works from any other intellectual property, and claim it as their own. For instance, if a machine were trained entirely on Disney properties, it could then create copyright for Disney works.<br/><br/>When people create fanworks, the original artist retains copyright of that idea. But when a robot is instructed to create a fanwork, yet is capable of creating copyright in doing so, it then has privileges that humans do not.
