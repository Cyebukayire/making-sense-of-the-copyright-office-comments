Ai should not be considered a copyrightable art as there are many things to account for<br/>1. It doesn&#39;t create as it more so re uses<br/>2. No one made anything, they just forced a computer to do it with prompts<br/>3. It&#39;s being used as a means to put film people out of the job<br/>4. It scares me and every one of my friends who wants to work in the entertainment industry as they don&#39;t want to be replaced by technology. I severely advise to make an content not protected under copyright as it also infringes on other people&#39;s rights in the first place. Thank you for your time.
