If A.I. generated images are not Copyright worthy, art done using paint programs like GIMP, Photoshop, and Paint are no different. Regardless of whether the input for an image is a text prompt or a mouse click, it is still using a computer program to produce an image. Like a picture drawn in paint, how much detail you add via either a mouse click or a text prompt will determine the complexity of the image.<br/><br/>Because many images are unique, how could someone duplicate an A.I. artwork if rhey didn&#39;t bhave the correct prompt set? Likewise how could anyone duplicate Picasso without the correct style, paints, and brushes?
