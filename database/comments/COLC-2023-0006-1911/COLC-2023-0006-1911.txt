We are inviting all kinds of problems by not regulating AI, heavily.  Just because corporations see dollar bill signs does NOT mean it should not be regulated.  We are talking about major changes to our existence.  There ARE some very promising signs for AI in the medical field and many others, but should not be available to the general public.  We didn&#39;t regulate the internet and look what it did to our 2016 election with heavy involvement from the Russians.  The same (only much worse) will happen with AI if it is not heavily regulated.
