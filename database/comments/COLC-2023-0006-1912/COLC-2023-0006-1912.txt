I do not think that &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; material should be in consideration for copyright protection. It seems like a very backwards idea, as nearly every AI Generated work is arguably in violation of copyright law due to how their algorithms work. Typically, when an artist uses another person&#39;s work, they are required to have a list of sources or reference material stating exactly what works were used along with permission from the copyright holders... AI works filter through so much stolen content that they try to skirt around even this basic courtesy, and I believe it&#39;s because if people had an exact list of what works were taken from that algorithm the supposed &quot;Artist&quot; who plugged in the prompt into the algorithm would be getting several violation lawsuits against them.
