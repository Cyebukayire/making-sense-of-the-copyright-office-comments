Artists (including actors and writers) should solely own their artistic works, and have the choice/ability to license or sell it as they see fit. It should not be allowed to be &ldquo;consumed&rdquo; by AI platforms as a means to teach the platform how to amalgamate the concepts of artists into saleable generic works that enrich said AI platform owners/operators/investors. It&rsquo;s morally wrong, it&rsquo;s in conflict with the human experience and frankly - it creates poor content that lacks a humanistic element (not unlike photocopies of a picture of a painting.) We should only embrace and invest AI as a means to improve life on Earth - in areas like medical research, for example. AI should be a tool, not a product or a usurping faux art creator. For these and many other reasons, I believe AI needs to be well regulated and artist rights/copyrights in the context of AI need to be protected. Thank you for your consideration.
