AI is a product of industrial-scale copyright theft, whose so-called &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; is a mere agglomeration of stolen human talent, artistry, and originality. As a playwright, and film and television writer and producer with nearly two decades of experience, I am beyond dismayed to see corporations pillaging my labor to &ldquo;train&rdquo; its AI without compensation of any kind. It is criminal, pure and simple. The idea that AI could generate copyrightable material of its own is absurd on its face, as AI can generate nothing on its own without the overt theft and repurposing of human ingenuity. AI is meant to degrade, cheapen, and finally eliminate human creative labor altogether. Aside from being a blatant criminal conspiracy disguised as a technological enterprise, the current AI regime is a ticking time bomb that threatens to de-skill and immiserate huge swaths of the working populace. At what point will our government stand up for the vast majority of its citizens against a techno-oligopoly that makes no secret of its intention to transform our society in unthinkable ways, all for the sake of the enrichment of a shrinkingly small cohort? Please stop AI from stealing out work, our livelihoods, and our humanity. Thank you for your attention.
