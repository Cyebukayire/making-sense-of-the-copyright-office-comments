As a writer and a visual artist, I believe AI needs to be more strongly regulated. I have intellectual property which I share online, and I think it&#39;s wrong for that IP to hypothetically be used to train an AI which others--and especially corporations--could make money from. People have also paid me to create artwork for their own IP- if these commissioned pieces were to end up in a training dataset, it would be violating both my wishes and the wishes of my clients. Lack of regulation would create further issues if, for example, myself or one of my clients filed a copyright for our IP. Many artists and writers share their work online and many have already had their work scraped and used for training AI. This happens without our consent, and those which compile these large training datasets aren&#39;t taking IP and copyright into account.
