AI generated art, music, writing, or any other endeavor should not be allowed to receive copyright protection. At this current time AI generation/AI learning revolves around feeding the program materials that people have actually created and worked on. Most of the time these databases are built using stolen work, and the creators of the original composition are rarely notified or asked permission if their works could be used in such a manner. If one was to allow copyright protection for AI created works, you are essentially copyrighting something that created from stolen works, which is an infringement upon copyright itself. <br/><br/>In conclusion, allowing AI generated work to be copyrighted would be the same as stealing money, exposure, enjoyment, ect from people who put their emotions, thoughts, and a part of themselves into the original works. There is no credit to the original creator when something is lifted from their work because there is very little way to tell. The original creators have not been asked if their work could be used to create the database that AI systems pull from, so it is all STOLEN works that companies thought they could get away with.
