I agree entirely with the review board&#39;s decision from February 14, 2022, in which they denied copyright as the work was created &ldquo;without any creative input or intervention from a human author&quot;. These are the two key terms that must be present in a work and its creation to earn copyright - creative input and/or intervention. Art is a creation by and for humans, and is protected under the law to insure rewards go to human authors. The use of any generative &quot;AI&quot; system that operates without intervention or input from a human author should proclude the result from copyright. The output is akin to a remix, which can only be copyrighted with explicit permission given by the creator of the original underlying work. Infamously, most generative AI models at present moment are made out of creative work scraped unceremoniously, and without consent nevermind copyright permissions, from the wider internet. Theft is the underlying infrastructure of these models. Conversely if someone could prove that they provided all the creative material for a generative system, they own the copyright on the underlying work and therefore copyright should go to that underlying material, not the generative output if it is not intervened upon by the author (i.e. an unedited &quot;novel&quot; generated by remixing an author&#39;s extant work.) This deliniation is crucial to the further viability of creative work - if art is to be made by machines for humans, the machines will simply out-compete by virtue of being machines, and further the race to the bottom that has devalued communication and art.
