The decision to allow copyright of AI works fundamentally undermines the concept of copyright in the first place. This would mean that you could train an AI model using a dataset of ambigously obtained works (as OpenAI has since been unwilling to comment on their use of copyrighted written work), without requiring permission to use said works, to generate a copyrightable work (written, image, etc) to then claim as your own and to sell to the public. The idea of copyrighting a piece of work, the result of a statistical combination of copyrighted work, holds the same analogy to claiming ownership over every sum and calculations that came as a result of a mathematical theorem.<br/><br/>Unless it can be argued that mathematical sums and their results can be copyrighted, AI work is still merely the result of statistical analysis of pre-existing data performed automatically by a machine. Algorithms related to AI models should be copyrighted as they required human effort to develop but the result of those models, using other people&#39;s copywritten work, is not human ingenuity, it&#39;s theft.
