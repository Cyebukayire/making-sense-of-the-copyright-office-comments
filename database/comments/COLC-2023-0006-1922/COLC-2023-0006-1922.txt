In Isaac Asimov&#39;s &quot;Runaround,&quot; he introduced the three laws of robotics.<br/> <br/>1) A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human to come to harm.<br/>2) A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. <br/>3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br/><br/>I thoroughly believe that AI, as we currently understand it, fundamentally breaks not just the first law as defined by Asimov. While Asimov&#39;s concepts were to be applied to automatons and synthetic life, the development of AI in recent years has gone beyond possibly even the imagination of science fiction. <br/><br/>To look at the first law of robotics, that a robot may not injure a human being, we must think of what the term &quot;injure&quot; truly means. One of the definitions is &quot;harm or impair,&quot; while another is &quot;to do damage to someone.&quot; AI harms us. AI injures us. For an artist or writer to have their work taken over by the work of AI is to do harm to the artist. Art, in all forms, is something produced to express or elicit an emotional response - and AI is incapable of experiencing emotional responses, so thus it cannot produce art. <br/><br/>For AI to replace the art of humans would be to harm not only the artists but would harm all of humanity. Humanity as a whole, the concept of what defines us, would be at the risk of being replaced by an algorithm that feeds and leeches off of the work of others. AI does not create. <br/><br/>It is for this reason, that I object to the idea that AI should be able to be used in copyrighted materials. Nor do I believe that AI should be allowed to steal from copyrighted materials. We do not allow individuals to plagiarize, so why would we allow a machine to plagiarize? Copyright is designed, in many ways, to protect the intellectual property of someone who created something. AI does not create. <br/><br/>While I do not agree with some elements of the copyright code - specifically what has allowed entities like the Walt Disney Company to own some of their works far beyond the lifespan of their creators, I don&#39;t believe the AI should be subject to these guidelines. Nor do I believe that AI should even be considered for these guidelines. As, I repeat, AI does not create.
