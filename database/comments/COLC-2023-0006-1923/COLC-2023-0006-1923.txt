Works generated by AI should not allowed to be copyrighted. Right now, many AI users would use the current copyright rules as argument that because it is not plagiarism (i.e. a pixel by pixel copy). However, if one examine the works produced by AI who scraped a particular artist&#39;s work, it is distinctively a copy of the style (see example). If an artists name is in the metadata of a image, the AI user can generate images based using the artist&#39;s work. Without the artist&#39;s original work, the AI cannot make anything. Ultimately, the AI is not a person, who filters an image through their mind, as much as coders like everyone to believe. They use words like &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;intelligence&quot; and the aesthetics of decades of Scifi to give AI personhood, specifically designed to bypass current copyright laws. If it is a tool, it is a tool that indiscriminately steals copyrighted works and cannot be regulated. I support the original intent of the copyright rules, and not it&#39;s current wording. The intent is to protect the intellectual property of artists. AI cannot make work without scraping, and thus there can be no ethically made AI because the metadata of a image on google is not always correct. And companies who make these AI have no incentive to police their own content scraping and currently social media pressure from victims barely works. Of course the making of an AI and the use of an AI cannot be banned, as a random person copying another&#39;s art is not illegal. But the AI generated &quot;work&quot; should not be copyrighted, which will at least prevent thieves from profiting of it.
