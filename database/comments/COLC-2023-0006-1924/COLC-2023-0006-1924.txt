Hello,<br/><br/>I am writing this comment with intent to persuade the U.S. Copyright Office against allowing Artificial Intelligence (henceforth referred to as AI), A.K.A. Machine Learning or Stable Diffusion, to remain unchecked and unregulated in all forms. My concerns are as follows:<br/><br/>1. AI is a tool used against smaller, independent creators, be they artists, writers, actors, or working through other mediums. Regularly these AI models such as ChatGPT or Dall-E collect artwork, video, writing, and other artistic works without the knowledge or consent of individuals who own these works and then cobble together a product that is passed off as its own creation. This blatant theft of intellectual property must be ended full stop.<br/><br/>2. The information produced through AI is routinely and demonstrably fabricated and can lead to real life consequences for innocent parties (Included but not limited to unjust imprisonment, injury, and death). From false books on natural foraging credited to authors that do not exist and using harmful misinformation, to People in professional settings using AI produced content as legitimate work with no fact checking, the danger posed by widely disseminating false info is evident<br/><br/>I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to strongly and succinctly regulate and restrict the usage and abilities of Artificial Intelligence programs wherever possible in order to protect creators and consumers alike.
