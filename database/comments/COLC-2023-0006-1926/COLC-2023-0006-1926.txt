Artists, writers, developers, actors, and workers of all backgrounds should should never be forced to see their work, their likeness, and their artistry used to create AI programs that a corporation can use instead of hiring a skilled human being, without their consent and a contract for proper compensation. AI developers should not be permitted to scum the internet for for others work without consent and compensation for every single contributor. Attempts by large studios and corporations to issue contracts to employees--career, seasonal or otherwise--that retain that worker&#39;s unique likeness, movements or skills in perpetuity should be banned outright. The trajectory of AI otherwise would facilitate a market where no skill, performance or likeness could not eventually be supplanted through clever implementation of an AI, leaving virtually no avenue left for human workers to maintain a healthy space in any marketplace.
