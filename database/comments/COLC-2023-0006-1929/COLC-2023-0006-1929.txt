I am an artist and I do not want my art to be used to train machine learning algorithms without my consent, but right now there is no way to ensure that that does not happen. Companies and consumers turning to AI art instead of human art for its cheapness and convenience will mean a major loss of income for all artists who work on commission. AI tools made from artists&#39; work without their consent with the intent of replacing those artists&#39; jobs is a serious violation of copyright.<br/>I am also an English instructor and am concerned about how AI language tools will impact the classroom. How will I tell the difference between something a student wrote and something a student got an AI to write for them? There needs to be a way to readily distinguish between human and AI-generated texts. Right now there is no reliable method.
