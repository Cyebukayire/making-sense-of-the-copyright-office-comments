Generative AI can and should be explored as a tool for individuals and businesses the world over, but the current state of affairs leaves far too much to be desired on the ethical and legal fronts, particularly when it comes to visual media. Corporations are developing and deploying this technology with no oversight and no accountability to the artists whose work is being used to train their generative AI products, and as such, much if not all work generated by these technologies is likely to be infringing on the rights of artists who have not been compensated for their involuntary participation. Government bodies should work to regulate the usage of publicly visual materials in generative AI technology. Until regulations are in place, only public domain works should be used in the training of these models, unless artists &quot;opt-in&quot; to the use of their work.
