Hello!  We need rules and regulations on the usage of AI instated ASAP. AI is being touted as revolutionary technology, but it&#39;s obvious to countless artists that it&#39;s merely copy -pasting our work and reusing/ repurposing it. It does not truly create original work, yet it pretends it does so that the tech companies who invented and manage these AI services can get rich without compensating the artists they are ripping off. In addition, a lot of large corporations are being seduced by the promise of AI - the ability to deliver voice acting, art work, music, films, etc. without having many, if ANY actual human beings to pay is enticing to them and makes them think this will improve their bottom line. Artists know this is an empty promise and fear that when the large companies realize they&#39;ve been duped, many people will lose their livelihood. We really hope and insist that the government will step in and REGULATE the usage of AI. Ideally it will be banned in the workplace, but if it is used then the company who does so needs to compensate ALL the artists whose work was stolen. We need to make it illegal to insist artists sign away the right to their work in the fine print of contracts, effectively giving away the right to use their work to be used by AI on future projects. <br/><br/>A great comparison would be the usage of sampling by hip hop producers in the 80&#39;s. If a classic song by James brown is being sampled to create a new beat for rappers to rap on top of, then both James Brown (or his estate, record label, etc) needs to be compensated for using his work. In the case of AI, these tech companies would be completely leaving James Brown, his estate, and his record label out of the conversation, which is undeniably wrong and is theft. <br/><br/>I hope that we can collectively realize what is happening here and pass laws as soon as possible to stop AI, and in the event it gets used, make sure artists whose work is getting scraped get compensated accordingly. <br/><br/>Thank you for you time.
