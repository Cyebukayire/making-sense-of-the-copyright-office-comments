AI, if unregulated can be harmful in many ways and I am against it&#39;s free use.  Here are some of the things that will unregulated AI will impact:<br/>-there will be harm to artists via stolen copyrighted work<br/>-there will be harm to artists, actors, and authors/writers when AI takes over because it is faster (but you lose the human creativity behind it).<br/>-there will be harm of deep fake images <br/>-there will be harm of fake porn - and give more people access to images and video of pedophilia because &quot;it&#39;s not real kids&quot; and perpetuate it as something that is &quot;normal and ok&quot; <br/>-there will be harm to academia as students AI generate their assignments and the education level and general knowledge/understanding of youth will diminish.<br/>-we will stop thinking for ourselves all together because there is a computer that does it for us.  How many kids know how to do long division versus taking their phone out to do the math?  How many kids don&#39;t know how to properly address an envelope or write a formatted letter?  Having unregulated AI will make this problem worse and on a larger scale.
