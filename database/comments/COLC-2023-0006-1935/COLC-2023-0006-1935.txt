So called &quot;AI art&quot; does not do what it claims and does not meet standards for human creation for copyright. The phrase &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; presupposes a mind capable of thought and creativity. This simply does not exist and possibly may never exist. Instead, what we have now is computational machine that generates data based exclusively on statistical analysis. <br/><br/>When a human produces art, even when producing something we might call derivative, say a collage, remix, or ready-made, labor is inevitably involved. The human must learn what such a work looks or sounds like. They must discern what will be interesting or relevant. They must procure and curate meaningful references. <br/><br/>By contrast, the machine does not learn, because it cannot. Instead, it has a data set, selected by human hands (which more often than not, includes works from artists who would have opted out). It dose does not discern, because it cannot. Instead it has filters and tags selected again by human hands. It does not curate, this again is done by people, who openly discuss sorting through dozens of ill fitting duds before selecting a sample that is appealing to them. <br/><br/>The heart of art is choice, and the work of choosing is what what the government attempts to protect through copyright. These machines make no choices, instead they simply place a statically likely pixel between the pixel that is likely to proceed it and the pixel that is likely to follow. Therefore, something that cannot make human choices should not be granted human copyright as the courts have already suggested. <br/><br/>Briefly, I&#39;d like to note that some people have suggested allowing human artists to copyright &quot;styles&quot; as a solution to stop the proliferation of direct imitators. This would give more more power to the engines within the law that presently squash satire, parody, and commentary, indeed, the essence of free speech. Denying copyright to procedurally generated pieces will do enough to prevent commercial exploitation of an artists labor without binding the hands of other human artists.
