Attempting to ban an idea is foolish at best. But, people should be honest, which is to say, AI art should always be labeled as such. AI written media, or really any creative media, should always be clearly identifiable. Purely AI created things should not be copyrightable, as a human did not make them. Prompts should be copyrightable, assuming a human crafted them. Human creativity, that&#39;s what we&#39;re protecting. That is the idea of a copyright in the first place.
