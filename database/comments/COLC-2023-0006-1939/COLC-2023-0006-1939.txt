Copyright is intended to provide a temporary monopoly to authors in order to encourage authors (in general) to create new works. The government should not enforce even a temporary monopoly on works that are generated exclusively from existing works rather than the application of the individual ingenuity. Since pattern matching algorithms (commonly called &quot;AI&quot;) generate works that are exclusively an amalgam of pre-existing works, their output should not be eligible for copyright, but rather should be entered into the public domain to avoid encouraging the wide-scale theft of existing protected works. <br/><br/>In many cases these algorithms derive from works which are ostensibly protected by copyright. It is even more important in these cases that the generator of such works be prevented from asserting any rights in these derivative works. The fact that the works are derivative from a large number of authors, rather than just one, should not make them eligible for government protection. To the contrary, these derivative works should be explicitly treated as public domain works, and any attempt to assert copyright on these derivative works should be regarded as copyright fraud.<br/><br/>Creating a derivative work from many authors should, perhaps, not be treated differently from single author derivatives. Rights in each derivative work should be granted to the original authors. But since it will not generally be possible to identify the original authors, it will not be possible to re-assign the rights in the derivative work to them. Assigning these works to the public domain is the best approach to ensuring the continued creation of genuinely new work.
