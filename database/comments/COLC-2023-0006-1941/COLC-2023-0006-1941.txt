It&#39;s outrageous that AI Companies were allowed to scrape legitimate authors&#39; work without our knowledge, permission or compensation.  As such, whatever AI generated works should not be copyrighted.  The person using an AI computer is not an author or writer, rather the AI program is the &quot;writer&quot;, and whatever output that is generated is compilation of words and phrases taken has been taken, stolen from other people&#39;s books, often without their knowledge, consent or compensation.  It&#39;s unethical to allow AI output to be used for sale.  There is a use for AI, but whatever output is generated should not get copyright or be sold outright as a legitimate literary work.
