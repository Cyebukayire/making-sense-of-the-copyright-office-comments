An ingredient is not a duplicate.<br/><br/>Small Business Owners - specifically designers &amp; photographers will be dramatically hurt if this regulatory scope is too broad. <br/><br/>The tools that these small business owners use now have AI &#39;content editing&#39; features built into them - they use the corpus of online data to automatically improve digital editing tools. These features will only become more and more ingrained in these tools. If the regulation passed is murky or too broad, it will hamper these small business owners from working as they do today because they will worry about being sued for just doing their jobs.<br/><br/>For example - these tools allow a wedding photographer to now insert a couple on a beach, that can&#39;t afford to go. This beach may have been created as a result of 10,000 other beach photos, the origin and IP specificity of which is unknown. <br/><br/>Because these works are created as a blend of thousands and thousands of other works, saying that because there was 1 that potentially was copywritten that was a small part of that data, would create a massive issue for all SMB owners who have to use these tools to make a living. <br/><br/>It would be the equivalent of a painter, taking inspiration from a copywritten work to create something new. <br/>Just because it was an ingredient, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a duplicate.
