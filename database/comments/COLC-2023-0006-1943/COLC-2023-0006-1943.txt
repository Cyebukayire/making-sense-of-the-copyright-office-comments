Any AI trained on the works of humans should not be allowed to be used for profit, especially in creative works (visual art, music, fiction, prose, etc) unless all of the humans/their estates are compensated. Additionally, using AI to create a likeness, both visual and &quot;work in the style of&quot; should not be permissible without explicit consent from the individual being imitated as it would dilute the market value of their work and could be used to misrepresent the individual.
