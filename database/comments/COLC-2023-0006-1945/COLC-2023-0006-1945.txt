My main concerns in regard to AI created work are mostly limited to arts and literature. I think any copyrights granted to AI created art should be very limited and stringent. <br/><br/>I have no idea what the thresholds should be. I have no background in law. But I feel like any creative work, where the majority of what was created was done by an autonomous process, should not have the protections something created purely by human labor should enjoy. I suppose it&rsquo;s for the law to determine what constitutes a &lsquo;tool&rsquo; and what constitutes an &lsquo;automated process&rsquo;. But I just feel there&rsquo;s something fundamentally wrong with the concept that an image created with a prompt, or a book where almost all the text is created by a machine, should enjoy the same legal protections as something created in a pre-AI process.<br/><br/>In a legal system with none of these limitations, the value of an artist&rsquo;s labor becomes nearly worthless. There will always be exceptions. But the market will be flooded with content that was created in mere seconds. Anyone trying to create work in a &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; manner won&rsquo;t reasonably be able to compete.<br/><br/>And beyond the competition aspect, who even created the work is more fundamental. If someone uses AI to write a novel, what argument do they have that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;their&rdquo; novel? The aren&rsquo;t really responsible for the work. The entered a few short prompts, pressed a few buttons, and a story was produced. It&rsquo;s not really their intellectual property. If someone claims a work is their intellectual property, I&rsquo;d think it should have to meet some standard to demonstrate it was created by their actual intellect. And I think that&rsquo;s the key issue. If the visuals or words weren&rsquo;t created in a detailed, deliberate, conscious process, then there&rsquo;s not really any intellectual property to protect.<br/><br/>AI is threatening to blur the line between art and a product. There&rsquo;s a reason why patents and copyrights are separate legal entities. And AI created work shares more of its essence with processed food, or material goods, than it does with traditional art, no matter the medium.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m hopeful the US legal system will see things this way, and protect the skilled, consciously created artworks over people, against the onslaught of mass-produced, AI produced products posing as intellectual property.
