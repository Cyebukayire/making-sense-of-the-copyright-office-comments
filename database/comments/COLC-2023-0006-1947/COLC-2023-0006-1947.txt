As an artist, I believe that Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) should not be granted copyright protection.<br/><br/>First and foremost, A.I. does not create work of any kind. It filters through (often stolen) data to then generate an image, work, etc based on an inputed prompt. There is no human element involved in the process of translating that prompt (or idea) into a material result. Not only is it merely copying/distorting existing work from within its datasets, the end result could not exist in any capacity without that given dataset. Therefore, its own &quot;work&quot; could not exist without the original work it has been trained through.<br/><br/>Often times the arguement will be made that A.I. &quot;uses references, just like humans do.&quot; This is a false equivalency. A.I. does not &quot;reference&quot; existing work, it outright plagerizes and infringes on existing works. During my undergraduate, I studied many artists work across a variety of styles and genres. No matter how much I observe, reference, and even duplicated a work, there was never a moment I felt said studies were my own original piece. There&#39;s already a word for those attempting to pass off the work of another as their own, plagerists.<br/><br/>In the end, the single biggest reason I belive A.I. should not be granted copyright protection, is that copyright is meant to protect and serve human artists. Copyright allows anyone the security that their work belongs to them, and they have the ultimate deciding power on how its used and who profts from it. Is it a perfect system? No. It&#39;s comical over-extension post the death of the original author stifles creative exepression and opportunity. Yet on the flipside, should A.I. be granted its legal protections, it will ultimately corrode each and every industry in which its cheap imitations are calculated as cost-effective. <br/><br/>Art exists to be created and consumed by human for humans. We should not live in a world were a piece of software can generate and profit from puppeting the corpses of creativity, while the people behind that creativity see little to no reward for their own work.
