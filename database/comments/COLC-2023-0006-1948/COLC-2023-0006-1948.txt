I am not an artist myself, but I have known both artists that have seen a decrease in commission jobs after the explosion of AI art tools, and other buyers who have stopped paying for commissions and used free tools instead. AI art should be forced to use voluntary submissions only, and must be made to pay those artists compensatory payment. Otherwise, it&#39;s just unfair. An artist&#39;s work MUST be used ONLY with their explicit consent.
