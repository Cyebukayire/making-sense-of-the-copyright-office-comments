I wanted to express my thoughts and concerns around AI developments and how it infringes on the lives of many around us. I also speak from a personal place, as a traditional artist. This has effected me, and my closest friends deeply. Our way of sharing with the world is under direct attack by the developments of these AI. Artists of all mediums deserve for their work to be protected from automatic scraping. If we artists are live persons, is not our right more important than a machine? What is a machine without us? Without artists? How can this thing be allowed to run rampant and steal from us to repurpose our works without a thought or care? This doesn&#39;t just threaten our hobbies and livelihood as artists, but our place to communicate and share with others in this world. The advancements of this technology has sent many of us into hiding and like a continental shift- broken our ability to share our work, our skill and personhood with the world. Art theft has always been a problem yes- but this machine functions to expedite that theft and leave us creators high and dry. So how can we in good confidence share our works with the world when we know it&#39;s only there for one click to be stolen and thrown into a meat grinder? There is also the cost effects of running this machine, and its environmental impacts. I cannot fathom, how this machine is such a huge benefit to all people, more than for real people to thrive and communicate? That it is ok for our rights to be forever jeopardized by its existence? From my position and experiance, this machine will only benefit by means of exploitation. So am I to believe that those who defend laws and are supposedly there to defend my rights would rather defend a machine&#39;s right to exploit me, than for me to be given the right to exist in a world amongst other living people? This is what I wanted to express. Please protect art, true art made by living people.
