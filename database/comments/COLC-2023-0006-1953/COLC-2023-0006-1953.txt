I am a voice actor, writer, and audio drama producer. On a personal level, I do not think A.I. used for artistic expression is positive, as it displaces artists with machines and will negatively impact job opportunities for artists. However, I still do not believe copyright law should be leveraged unfairly in response. I think A.I. can be a fun tool to use, and also a way for indie creators to subsidize their creative endeavors. It also can be helpful as a creative &ldquo;kick starter&rdquo; tool for artists and writers to help with ideas they can then build off of. <br/><br/>The main issue with A.I. as far as my industry (voice over) is when our voices are essentially carbon copied to create content. Your voice and/or likeness is also something very personal and immediately identifiable to you. It is very unjust for people to use your voice (or likeness) in their commercial content unauthorized and without compensating you. The economic impacts are obvious, as why would someone hire you if they can use your voice or likeness for free? As far as non-commercial use, a concerning issue is &ldquo;deep fakes&rdquo;, which make it difficult to tell fiction from reality. A.I. allows for your voice/likeness to be replicated, allowing the potential for them to be used to express opinions or say things which you do not believe nor endorse. With the increasing sophistication of A.I., it may be very difficult or impossible for people to discern it is not actually you, which can seriously damage your reputation. Due to all these reasons, I believe there needs to be serious limitations on A.I. using a person&rsquo;s voice and likeness, whether for commercial or non-commercial content. <br/><br/>I do not believe fully A.I. generated work should be about to be copyrighted. There is not enough of a human element involved to justify copyrighting a machine-produced work, particularly if the A.I. is using the internet and the works of others to &ldquo;train&rdquo; and create. <br/><br/>As far as use of materials in training A.I, it seems quite difficult, if not impossible, to create laws regarding infringement regarding training/creation of A.I. material if the programs are sifting through vast amounts of material online. It seems reasonable this should fall under fair use, especially if the generated work itself cannot be copyrighted, rendering it commercially worthless. If A.I. generated work is changed by human intervention, it should meet a certain level threshold of change from the originally generated work to be eligible for copyright.
