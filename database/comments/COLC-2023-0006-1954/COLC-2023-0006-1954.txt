I do see several benefits to using AI. Artificial intelligence can simplify tasks ranging from household chores to organizing scientific data, both of which can make life easier for humans and give us more time for more creative and fulfilling work. I also think that a lot of AI-generated art is beautiful, in its own way.<br/><br/>However, I have many reservations about the current and potential future usage of AI. Like with automation, AI threatens the jobs of many Americans&mdash;software like Chat GPT has proven an ability to pass the bar and complete other &quot;white-collar&quot; tasks. While AI tools still require substantial human supervision, it is not impossible that these tools will soon become advanced enough to effectively do at least part of the work of a human, reducing the number of jobs available for humans. I don&#39;t think this is inherently bad, but we as a country need to have a plan in place to address this loss of jobs. Layoffs due to AI are only an issue if people need jobs to survive&mdash;if we create stronger social safety nets, the ease provided by AI could improve the workloads and livelihoods of everyone.<br/><br/>I also think the AI industry needs to be more transparent. People need to be able to understand how AI tools work, what data they were trained on, and ideally what their strengths and limitations are. Companies should publicize which humans (including contractors and gig workers) contributed to AI tools and ensure that these humans are paid fairly. And AI-generated content should be labeled as such.<br/><br/>Finally, I&#39;m hesitant about using AI in any &quot;creative&quot; role, such as screenwriting. Making art is an enjoyable and deeply human pursuit; I don&#39;t like the idea of &quot;outsourcing&quot; such things to AI unless there are truly not enough people interested in the art itself.
