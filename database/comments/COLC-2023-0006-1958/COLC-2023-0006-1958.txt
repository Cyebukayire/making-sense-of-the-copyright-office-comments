I believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) must be regulated for two substantial reasons:<br/>1) AI is damaging to artists, scriptwriter, and anyone in the media industry<br/>Ask any artist how they feel about AI and your answer will be resoundingly negative; This is because an AI can&#39;t just make a picture or write a script, it must scrape existing art widely available on the internet to train itself. The problem is that such as is often done without the original creator&#39;s consent, and if AI generated content is used for monetary gain, the original creator will likely never see a cent. Worse, if big business, like Hollywood, make the use of AI mainstream, it will not only effectively kill the arts industry, putting thousands out of a job, but it will also spawn a sea of content that lacks what makes art truly great: human heart, soul, and passion, things an AI can never truly replicate. <br/>2) Voice AI can lead to serious trouble for real people<br/>A popular form of AI is voice AI, one that takes clips containing someone&#39;s voice, fictional or real, and using it to say anything. So far, the content produced has has benign, such as a fictional character singing a song or the US presidents playing a video game, but this can be easily become problematic; Voice AI can easily neuter the Voice Acting industry, who after recording a set number of lines, will most likely not be payed to have their likeness used as much as the company wants, again putting thousands out of jobs. Using Voice AI to impersonate a real person can be even more dangerous, as the AI can be used to make the person &quot;say&quot; anything, no matter how damaging it is to said person&#39;s image, and if used with deep fake technology-which is a video of a person in which their face and/or body has been digitally altered to appear as someone else-will make misinformation much harder to combat.<br/>Bottom line, Artificial Intelligence must be regulated to avoid serious problems in the near future.<br/>Thank you for taking the time to read this<br/>Carl E Narvell Jr
