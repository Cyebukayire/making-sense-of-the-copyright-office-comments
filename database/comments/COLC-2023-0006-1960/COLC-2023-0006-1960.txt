AI has been creating a living hell for independent creators. Not only is it hard enough for us to get started, but we already deal with a lot of theft of our work because, quite frankly, copyright laws do more to protect large corporations than they ever did to protect us. With the rise of AI, I&#39;ve seen multiple of my artist friends have their works straight up stolen and used without permission by every day people, and that&#39;s not to mention what larger corporations could do with that. It would destroy the need for jobs like Concept Artist, Logo Designers and Graphic Designers, they could and would just start feeding the submissions of artists that they like into an AI and have that AI produce work in that artist&#39;s likeness and the artist themself never see a cent of any profit from that project because they weren&#39;t hired. It&#39;s become an arms race of creating watermarks and using programs to protect their works from AI, only for AI to have been trained to remove these a couple weeks later to continue being able to steal. <br/><br/>This is only one of the sides. My other biggest concern is the companies with direct access to whatever files are put onto the Cloud. Many artists and writers alike save a lot of their work on the Cloud in the occasion that something happens to their hardware/software and they lose everything on it, at least it&#39;ll also be saved on the Cloud, so it&#39;s recoverable. The fear of losing years of work is gone because of a reliable saving source. However, companies like Adobe have already started selling the work of whoever uses their products to train AI without the artist&#39;s consent, simply changing their terms and conditions and taking advantage that they have the entire market cornered so it&#39;s either let Adobe sell your work (without you seeing a cent of it) to AI, or get locked out of the entire system and find something else to do your work on. Google has also already started using public articles (many of which are not in public domain) and the likes to start training a writing AI. While there are lots of program options for writers out there, the fact remains that multiple writers use Google Docs as a way to keep their works at hand, easy to access and safe from computer theft or hardware/software corruption. Without proper copyright protection, nothing would prevent Google from selling these, oftentimes unfinished and unpublished, works (again, the writer in question never receiving a single cent of this) to train AIs. With the ongoing technological advances, we are slowly pushing everything to the Cloud and keep pushing everything online whether we want to or not, and at that point, what remains safe from corporate greed? Artists and writers are running out of genuinely safe options to keep their works in without fear that it&#39;ll be stolen to feed AI. <br/><br/>Furthermore, if these companies do manage to use artists or writers&#39; likeness in their AI pursuits and then, using those resources, another party, independent or a company, creates something from the AI, becomes large and influential, would that party then be able to accuse the artist or writer whose works were stolen from of plagiarism due to the inevitable similarities? The AI art/writing/any creative possibility has become a living nightmare for independent creatives everywhere. If our work is not already actively being stolen from, there is a huge possibility it will in the future. We need protections like preventing AI being fed works not already in Public Domain, it&#39;s the only hope we have left.
