Hello,<br/>I am an artists, I work drawing commissions and other private projects. This work makes me able to survive while I care or my disabled child at home. With it I can pay everything she needs. I am really grateful for it, I will never be rich, but surviving and meeting all my child&#39;s needs is enough for me.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I had to reduce my prices because I recently my comissions aren&#39;t selling. I saw Fiverr (an online commission website) saturated with offers of AI imagery and illustrations for as low or lower than $30; a price I cannot compete. I am worried for my bills, I am worried for my future, I am worried for the future and health of my child.<br/><br/>I spent years of my life studying to get good enough skills to be able to survive as an artist, but without any compensation or consent, various companies downloaded my work and trained a machine to replicate it.<br/><br/>Now I am competing in the market against people that use those machines to replicate my own work, how this is fair or just? I am having monetary difficulties, while the ones who created the machines are getting rich. I am scared, if I post my work online they will download it and keep training the machine with MY work against my will, but if I stop posting online I will not being able to survive and pay my expenses.<br/><br/>I fear for me, I fear for my child, I fear I will not be able to pay rent soon. Please don&#39;t allow those companies to destroy millions of lives allowing them to parasite off our work without consent or compensation.
