&quot;Making&quot; content with an AI isn&#39;t &quot;creative&quot; at all on the part of any human, it&#39;s having a machine (crudely) create art and weave dreams for you while we do nothing and we turn our back on one of mankind&#39;s greatest and most influential assets. Are Americans still mostly Christian today? You believe in God, Heaven and Hell right? Well, if you believe in Peter Binsfeld&#39;s classification of demons, then Belphegor, the demon of Sloth, is effing laughing his ass off at the idiots pushing for AI content!
