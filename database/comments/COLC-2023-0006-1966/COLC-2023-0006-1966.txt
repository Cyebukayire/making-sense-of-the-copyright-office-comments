AI has had an unfortunately big hand in today&#39;s decline of artist respect and livelihoods. I do not think that AI as a tool of creation nor it&#39;s &quot;artists&quot; have any merit to their work in contrast to real, human artists. Artists of today&#39;s society as a whole are underpaid, overworked, and largely disrespected- AI aside. We have every right as a society to nurture the talent of actual real-life artists, much as we&#39;ve done for the entirety of human history. Without the influence of art and artists throughout history we wouldn&#39;t be where we are today and how far we&#39;ve progressed as a society. The interference of AI in the artistic regard is a social issue that I believe we should not take lightly. AI &quot;artwork&quot; should not be copyrighted due to the shift in importance we will make as a government to disregard the real people behind all art that should be considered with more regard.
