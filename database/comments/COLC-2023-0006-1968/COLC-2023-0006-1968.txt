I believe any and all machine learning or artificial intelligence programs MUST ask an original creator for permission to use any form of media in its learning algorithms. If said programs are intended to be used for profit, the original creators of any media to be used in their algorithms must be credited AND paid for licensing. I believe all websites where media can be shared by users should have an option for creators to OPT IN to allowing their media to be used in machine learning (therefore they are set to OPT OUT DY DEFAULT.) Alternatively, OPT IN may be done on a post-by-post basis. <br/>In short, unless a creator is under a contract that states otherwise, a CREATOR is the OWNER of a piece of media, NOT the website it is posted on.
