AI is leading the world into dangerous territory.  The line between reality and fiction when dealing with such things becomes blurry, although seemingly not a problem on the surface, the technology will start to affect our world in ways we cannot fathom at the moment.  I am against the common use of AI technology in the general population, I think it best reserved only for medical fields for purposes of good  - and should be rejected by the people otherwise.
