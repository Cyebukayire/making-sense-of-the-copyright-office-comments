Generative AI is, In my opinion, a massive danger to several creative industries and thus should not be copyrightable. This technology does not create, but instead lazily mixes several copyrighted sources together (An example would be a AI text to speech program cloning the voice of a actor without their permission.) People who promote these programs are among those most willing to plagiarize other&#39;s work, as it&#39;s a common tactic to specifically name a artist in the prompt for generated images.<br/><br/>The threat is magnified when taking into account the recent SAG-AFRA strikes, where a point of issue for writers and actors were generative AI programs such as chatGPT. Hollywood has several reasons to try and cut more and more jobs as they fight to become tech companies that trade stocks on infinite growth, and those who promote AI have taken note of this, many fantasizing about a day where film and television were randomly generated by prompt, only the coders of the program and the hollywood execs getting all of the profits from the deluge of sludge.<br/><br/>I am of the opinion that there should be a strict no AI policy for copyright, if a work has audio, video, images or even scripts generated by AI, that they cannot be copyrighted (Recent examples of this tech getting into media is the recent marvel streaming series &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; and the frankly cringe worthy comedy game &quot;High on life&quot;) This is a demon that if given a inch will take several thousand miles and would decimate the creative industries, as well as create havoc in independent spaces. I bet you that several people financially invested in getting every creative industry using their scam have been using chatGPT to spam this inquiry with fluff about their garbage.<br/><br/>I am very clearly biased, but several people are very biased against drunk driving, because that&#39;s a bad idea. Generative AI is a very, very bad idea.
