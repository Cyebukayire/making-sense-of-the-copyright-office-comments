Hi, I work within the arts/entertainment industry at a local nonprofit theatre and I have concerns regarding the unregulated use of AI due to the threats they pose to copyright and artists&#39; careers.<br/><br/>Working within the local arts community, I&#39;ve seen the passion that people bring and uniquely express through writing, art, performance, etc., and that creative process and collaboration is not something that AI will ever be capable of replacing. Regulations will ensure that the work of local artists is protected while allowing them to continue their creative process without the fear of having their work stolen or redistributed without their consent. Many of the people I work with on a daily basis would not want to continue to create or innovate if it meant their work would be used without their knowledge or consent to train an AI model.
