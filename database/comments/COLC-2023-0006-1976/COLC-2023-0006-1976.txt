A.I. needs to be regulated! <br/><br/>I am a independent (freelance) commercial photographer and make a living from the creation of my images and their usage. With more and more of my clients requiring to own the copyright to images I create and the fast and furious pace in which A.I. is coming down the pike, it&rsquo;s more important than ever that our government push back on the tech companies, that from my point of view, have been running roughshod over the country for years.<br/><br/>I truly believe the basic role of government is to protect it&#39;s citizens. And in this case to protect its citizens against large corporate forces that - especially as an independent artist - I do not have the ability to fight on my own.<br/><br/>While A.I. regulation may not be able to have an affect on my specific concern, I do believe that all artists and creators should have inherent ownership over their work. A.I. (and all social media for that matter - come on guys) needs guardrails, just like every industry.
