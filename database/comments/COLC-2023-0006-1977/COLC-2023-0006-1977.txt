Any created work by AI generation that uses material from humans, especially previously copyrighted material, should not itself be able to be copyrighted. AI generated content is not original, and must use outside material as its source. Therefore it can not be protected and given ownership to another person or company. <br/><br/>If a singular artist works with a singular AI algorithm where the source material is only that of the aforementioned artist, perhaps the works created could be copyrighted to that artist.<br/> But in all other cases, there should be no protections given to the AI generated work that derived from someone else&rsquo;s original content.
