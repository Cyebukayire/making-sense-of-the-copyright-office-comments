Given the following facts: <br/>- A generative AI is a computer program made by people.<br/>- The people who made these programs profit off of them.<br/>- A generative AI program is not alive and is not itself human.<br/>- Generative AI requires a dataset of images to generate anything; it cannot be used without these datasets.<br/>- These datasets have been built using innumerable stolen works.<br/>- Theft is illegal.<br/>- The United States of America has copyright protections in place to prevent theft and exploitation of the work of artists and writers.<br/><br/>It follows that: <br/>- Anything &quot;created&quot; with generative AI programs is not copyrightable, and should never be considered copyrightable.<br/><br/>It&#39;s as simple as that.<br/><br/>Profiting off of mass theft, or using mass theft to build your business, is not and should not be legal. Innumerable creatives are currently being harmed by this technology by having their work stolen, and by potentially being put out of work by the very datasets that their work was used to build without their consent.<br/><br/>Even if all generative AI programs had their datasets completely replaced with work by consenting artists and writers, the technology was still built using stolen work. That violation of rights cannot be reversed. The current existence of the technology itself is predicated upon use of the stolen work.<br/><br/>Allowing ANY generative AI outputs to be copyrighted would send an extremely disturbing message: that in the U.S., theft of an individual&#39;s work is okay (so long as it isn&#39;t owned by a corporation).<br/><br/>Thank you for reading and for listening to the human artists and writers whose lives are being directly impacted by this technology.
