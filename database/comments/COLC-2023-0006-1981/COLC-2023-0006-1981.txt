AI works should not be copyrighted. The manpower required to produce one piece of outwork dwarfs the effort of creating &quot;AI art&quot; to such a degree that they are incomparable. The time and effort to create AI art assures that there is truly no intellectual or artistic property being built because there was no true intellectual or artistic effort put into the pieces.<br/><br/>Copyrighted materials being used to train models is admittedly spitting on the work of artists, and should not be allowed. The alternate perspective is that artists themselves draw inspiration and learn from pieces of copyrighted art, but the line between inspiration and mimicking is typically where copyright is drawn. The fact that this is AI should not change that. AI does not simply &quot;draw inspiration&quot; from works of art, or literature, but steals the techniques and style of the artist. <br/><br/>Due to the widespread use of AI, commissions for art and stories have decreased. AI is being used to replace human work, effort, and care in the very personal pursuit of art and beauty. <br/><br/>If someone attempts to share or profit off of AI-generated materials that have infringed on copyright by training on copyrighted materials, the person should be obligated to remove that AI-generated material and no longer receive profit off of it. If they can prove they weren&#39;t aware of the copyright infringement, they shouldn&#39;t have to pay much of a fine because it wasn&#39;t entirely their fault. The creators of AI models that train on copyrighted material should have to terminate service and pay a fine.<br/><br/>These responses derive from personal experience and anecdotes heard from others in the community of artists and writers. AI works should not be eligible for copyright. Copyrighted materials should not be used to train AI models. If a model is trained on copyrighted materials, the creator should take down the model and pay a fine, and users that share or profit of the works of the model should cease their taking of profits and credit the creators of the copyrighted works used, if not take the material away entirely.
