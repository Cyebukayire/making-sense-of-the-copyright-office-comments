I think AI should not be copyright-able when it plagiarizes human beings and literally will put writers and artists out of work. I am sick and tired of this country that I live in ALWAYS giving in to lobbyist over actual citizens without regard to the economic devastation it will cause for working class Americans. Enough. Do your job. Stand up for the people of the United States of America. And, do not act as a shill for corporate America. Corporate America is who got us into this mess in the first place after all.
