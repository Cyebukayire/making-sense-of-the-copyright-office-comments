The Compendium II of Copyright Office Practices Section 202.02: &quot;In order to be an original work of authorship, the work must contain at least a certain minimum amount of original creative expression. [...] for a work to be copyrightable, it must owe its origin to a human being.&quot;<br/><br/>The standard is clear. Without a human author and without the work being de minimus, there is no eligibility for copyright protection. This stance has been upheld for 50 years including as recently as 2022. Current copyright law is more than capable of being enforced on AI generated content without any new legislation.
