Please help us in the creative sector, as we are already suffering from the use of &#39;AI&#39; generative art. Show these companies that they can&#39;t get away with stealing our art and using it to replace us. The push for AI is a threat to our livelihoods and the future of our industries. We need you to prioritize human beings (and if it helps to see it this way, voters) over a few tech bros reaping the profits of our labor and hardship. <br/>We don&#39;t want our jobs to become so undervalued that we can&#39;t support ourselves and our families, yet that&#39;s what&#39;s already happening. Please help us.
