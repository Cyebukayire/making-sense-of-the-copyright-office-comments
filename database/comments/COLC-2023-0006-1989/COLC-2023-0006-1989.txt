Copyright as a concept was made to protect the hard work of artists and creatives alike so that others can&#39;t copy their hard work and re-sell it with no support for the artist. When it comes to AI art, there is no artist. The AI isn&#39;t breaking a sweat because it can&#39;t break a sweat. The AI isn&#39;t putting in any hard work, so then why should it be protected under copyright? There is no reason AI should have it&#39;s &quot;hard work protected&quot; if there is no hard work being put into the image.<br/>Another reason AI art shouldn&#39;t be held under copyright is the issue of who holds the copyright. Would it be the person who made the prompt? Would it be the developer, the person who put in the work, behind the AI? Would the AI itself own the copyright? Or would the copyright go to the artists work the AI was trained off of? The issue of who the rights the art goes to is too confusing.
