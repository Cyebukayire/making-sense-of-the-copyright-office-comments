Artificial Intelligence is not a human creator, learns by taking pieces human creator&#39;s copyrighted work and mashing them together to make it&#39;s work. It is a way for large companies and bad actors to not pay real workers for their creative output in all media and should not be given protection for all these reasons. Only human work should be copyrightable.
