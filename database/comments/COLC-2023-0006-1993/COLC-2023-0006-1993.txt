Hello, I am a citizen who is concerned about where artificial intelligence will take our nation to. I am against artificial intelligence due to the risks it has, and can leave many good people out of a job. Recently, where I live, it is a lot harder to be employed, and I imagine with AI this will persist for a lot longer than it should. Corporations will also take artificial intelligence to the point where nobody will be able to get a job. Prices are rising, yet companies such as Disney refuse to pay their workers properly and instead decide to hire others for AI positions. This is frightening to hear that they would much rather take advantage of AI rather than pay their workers fairly. I firmly believe that AI should not take over and should not be able to be copyrighted. Artificial intelligence takes from other people instead of it generating pieces of work itself. Therefore, would that not be considered stealing? Is it a truly honest practice if it is laying people off from jobs and stealing their work? Is it even safe to say there would not be any sort of risk to America if artificial intelligence kept expanding to more corporations with absolutely no regulations?<br/>Artificial intelligence is already laying people off from jobs, what else will happen if there are no acts done to make sure people will still be able to work and have families in this nation?
