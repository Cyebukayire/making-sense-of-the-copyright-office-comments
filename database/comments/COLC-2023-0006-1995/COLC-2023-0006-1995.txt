As a writer with fiction posted on the internet on websites that have experienced known data scrapes for that purpose, it&#39;s likely my words have been used to train an AI, without my permission (which I would not have granted had I been asked). It feels as if a small piece of my humanity was stolen and fed to a machine. It&#39;s a disgusting feeling, and I wish there was some recourse to remedy this. It&#39;s a violation, and the prose regurgitated by these machines in response to prompts should have no protection under the copyright that already failed to protect real human authors in this whole process.
