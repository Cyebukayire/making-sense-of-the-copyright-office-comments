AI art steals from artists and copyright laws make it harder for artists to monetize their work. I would prefer if AI art didn&rsquo;t exist because art only has value if a person places value into it. AI&rsquo;s are trained to recognize patterns and steal those patterns from artists to create something based on a prompt. No decisions are being made, no one put thought into design. I want artists to be able to work healthily, get paid enough to live healthily, and not have to worry about being replaced by something that steals under the guise of creation. I don&rsquo;t think new copyright laws will accomplish this. Art is derivative by nature, and the uniqueness comes from the individuals who makes it. Being stricter on copyright laws could be gatekeeping individual artists and would be more beneficial to corporations who want to abuse them. Maybe it would be better to make stricter rules on AI art so people can give consent to doing that or have their work not used in it at all if they don&rsquo;t give consent.
