Hello. Thank you for your time regarding this issue. It is massively important and well worth tackling.<br/><br/>I have followed the AI boom since the rise of Dalle and what I can say is that while this is good for gauging potential conflict, it is ultimately lopsided. The pro-AI side has used many excuses to justify their tech and many of them have been either objectively wrong or twists of facts. The truth of AI is that it isn&#39;t truly AI. These are LLMs and compilers that act not of their own volition but on the whims of others. They are trained not by themselves but by order of those behind it. When it scrapes the internet for data (with no opt-in policy) it will scrape up copyrighted or protected data without consent, credit and compensation in mind. This is not a bug, it is a feature and one that stops many of it&#39;s comparisons. AI does not function like a camera nor is it creating like a human would. When we talk about AI we need to frame it as an algorithm controlled by a company, not a tool or person.<br/><br/>The glaring issue here is that AI is scraping things that are objectively protected under copyright and that the pro-AI crowd has excused themselves from taking any accountability nor providing meaningful options to right any wrongs. The answer has been &quot;artists as a service&quot; which not just presents other issues but fails to answer issues such as opt-in for the major bots. If we would like to promote progress it cannot come at the expense of hard working people who never consented to their work being used. Promoting progress should not also be an excuse to cut workers from the process of creation as seen with the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike. We must also understand that AI has been used to replicate/impersonate people - many of which are popular in one way or another and done without consent. This poses large issues regarding security and misinformation but it is also a brazen act of unauthorized use of identity for profit. I&#39;d argue that this has already been decided by Midler v. Ford Motor Co. when Ford used an impersonator of Bette Midler and found that her voice was a protected part of her identity. This was not a copyright case however I think it&#39;s fair to consider it when we talk about how AI is used.<br/><br/>What is coming out of AI shouldn&#39;t constitute anything copyrightable. Animals cannot copyright because it ultimately comes down to human ingenuity and AI isn&#39;t that. While a human prompts it, the AI does the heavy lifting and gives something that the person prompting couldn&#39;t have accurately imagined. That&#39;s the key part. The prompter has no real say or power as to what comes out and therefore should not be able to take credit for the work. Unlike remixing where an artist tastefully chooses how to sample, prompters do not have that same luxury. It gets trickier when it comes to works incorporating AI elements but a line needs to be drawn. Perhaps it should come down to datasets. If there is work it is being trained off of that they do not have permission to use or have no mechanism for paying, the copyright cannot exist for it&#39;s the work of others.<br/><br/>We need to craft laws carefully. First, we cannot copyright style. What constitutes style is entirely subjective and would open the doors for some incredibly harmful lawsuits. Is the blues a style or is watercolor landscapes a style? If so they are liable to copyright which would stunt artistic growth. Second, the law must be heavily focused on the three Cs - consent, compensation and credit. If the data sets continue to scrape work that they will neglect those Cs while being the replacement and/or the moneymaker they want to be, the law has failed the people. Third, we must avoid the pitfalls of &quot;artists as a service.&quot; This will be a new avenue to degrade the value of artists labor and work while ushering in a non-competitive arena that would ultimately drive artists away from creation. I think having compensation go to people who did nothing while others took the info and fed it to an AI would be theft. Instead all compensation should go back to the consenting artist rather than the prompter.
