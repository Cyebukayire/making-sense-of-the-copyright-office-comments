I worry about new artists trying to enter the field, amidst what seems like an excuse for corporations and business big and small to skip the design process in exchange for something AI generated, no matter how mediocre the result may be. It is already hard enough for artists to break into their respective fields, but to be considered obsolete in exchange for something that cannot supply the point of view, evolving purpose beyond prompt, and back and forth creative process a human can supply is reductive. That, and their own work could be mined for content without consent and then used if copyright does not evolve to consider AI sourcing. For someone&#39;s style to be copied and used without their consent and without them receiving any compensation compounds the troubled livelihood of many creatives. This on top of greedy executives who seem all too eager to replace any sort of paid labor is frightening for me as an artist with many artist friends trying to make ends meet.
