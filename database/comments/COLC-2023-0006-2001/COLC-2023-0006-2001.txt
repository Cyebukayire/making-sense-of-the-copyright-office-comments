First, a philosophical statement: all technologies are double-edged swords inherently. From the first human tools to today&#39;s generative AI, there are always positive and negative possibilities. I think it&#39;s important to state that upfront, because it informs the logic of my argument. I classify generative AI exactly the same as I classify photo editing software, a music synthesizer, or a paintbrush. It is a tool that humans can use for creative and constructive purposes.<br/><br/>Regarding the matter of copyright, there has been much discussion about the need for legal reforms in the past three decades or so, well before generative AI of this type. As it is, the laws seem outmoded and weighted towards large corporations that own vast libraries of intellectual property that, in many cases, they had no actual hand in creating. So already we have a mess to deal with without even taking into account these emerging technologies. That might sound irrelevant, but I include it for context as to the lack of confidence many have in the U.S. Copyright Office to be nimble enough to adapt to these rapid developments in AI. To be blunt, if it has hitherto not been able to provide a satisfactory solution to the problem of disputes between small online creators and large IP holders over fair use issues that have existed for the past 20 years, how can it be expected to tackle legislation over technology that substantiality evolves quite literally by the week?<br/><br/>In my capacity as a private citizen and multimedia artist, I have already seen great value in generative AI. Moreover, in my capacity as a historian with a special interest in technology, I can see that AI represents a paradigm shift that no amount of legislation, here in the U.S. or abroad, will be able to curtail. Its utility is simply too great to ignore or stunt, much like computers and the Internet were decades ago. It is here, and will remain, and we have to adapt to it.<br/><br/>That being the case, how should we attempt to regulate it? Carefully, in my view. It should neither be underestimated nor demonized.<br/><br/>Generative AI can be thought of as a sort of successor to procedural generation algorithms that have been in use since practically the dawn of personal computing. It has long been understood that procedurally-generated content created by software tools is subject to the same copyright parameters as any other type of work: to wit, a person or company can create a piece of software that generates a type of media, and provide a license to make the output either copyrightable or not. Why is generative AI any different?<br/><br/>Let&#39;s jump from the philosophical to the practical for a moment. Let&#39;s assume that works generated via AI are deemed to be categorically public domain, non-copyrightable. How is that enforceable? As it is, today, it can be difficult for good AI works to be distinguished from human works. As the technology improves, this will only get more difficult. With sufficient editing, it may be impossible. Does the editing change its copyright status? How much editing is sufficient to render it transformative vs. derivative? How can that be assessed?<br/><br/>Given these factors, my argument is that works created with generative AI should be copyrightable based on one philosophical point: that a human entered a prompt to create it, no different than writing a sentence which would be copyrightable by default as long as it wasn&#39;t plagiarized. If I take a digital photograph, a machine is following my instructions to create an image. If I import it into an image editing program and modify it, I am, via a GUI, telling that program to use its abilities to do so, and there is no question of copyright. What makes a generative AI app any different? Because it&#39;s easier? That doesn&#39;t hold water as an argument against its copyrightability.<br/><br/>My argument is also based on the practical point raised above: it&#39;s ultimately unenforceable, even with watermarks, which can be defeated by other means.<br/><br/>On the matter of AI training on copyrighted works, the fact is that copies of those works are not part of the AI algorithm. If it&#39;s legal for a human to do an image search and learn to draw from copyrighted works, it should be legal for a machine to do the same thing, as long as no illegal copies of the media are saved within the program.<br/><br/>In the case of using the likeness or voice of a person via AI generation, the same laws should apply as already exist for human renderings of actors, impersonation, etc. The tools used should not make a difference. A sufficiently talented human being is perfectly capable of unlawful imitation of preexisting works and individuals. The fact that AI makes it more accessible to the average person is irrelevant.<br/><br/>Ultimately, generative AI probably needs no special regulations under copyright law. Existing laws are sufficient, and as a practical and philosophical matter, there is little logic in attempting to do so. Thank you for your consideration.
