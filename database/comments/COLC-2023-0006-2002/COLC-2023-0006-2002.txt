AI works should only be copyrightable if the copyrightee has done:<br/><br/>1) Built said AI themselves, or got permission from said AIs creator<br/><br/>and 2) Created all material and data used for the AI to learn, or got permission from said person who created the data used to train the AI<br/><br/>Number 2 is what I feel is the biggest issue with copyrightibg AI.  Neural networks were never an issue until it was found out AIs like ChatGPT  used data from all over the internet with no notice or permission received from the individuals who created said data.
