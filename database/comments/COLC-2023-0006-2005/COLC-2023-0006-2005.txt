&quot;1. Originality and Attribution: Generative AI depends on existing works to create &lsquo;new&rsquo; pieces. The questions of ownership and originality are blurred by AI marketing buzz, posing challenges for artists who wish to protect their intellectual property.<br/><br/>2. Lack of Consent: AI systems are trained on datasets that have been appropriated without the explicit consent of the original creators. This poses a significant ethical dilemma in an online world already fraught with issues surrounding plagiarism and appropriation. They should be opt-in only.<br/><br/>3. Economic Impact: The proliferation of AI-generated images, writing, code, voices, music, and more is devaluing human-made work and affecting people&rsquo;s livelihoods. Creatives are now competing against a flood of their own work for discoverability and revenue in every conceivable marketplace.<br/><br/>4. Transparency: AI companies are not being transparent about their models. It&rsquo;s not an open-source vs closed-source debate, as companies like Stability AI prove that making the software available doesn&rsquo;t open source the weights needed to understand it.&quot;
