If AI is considered copyright infringement, then any content generated by an artist which has been inspired by another artist must be an infringement. AI models learn by viewing and by recreating from what has been learned. This is exactly what artists do. If models have to list the sources and these have to be not copyrighted, then any artist that publishes anything original, must also cite all the operas that inspired them, and they must not be copyrighted.<br/>A generative model generated an original and unique work of art, which must be copyrightable by the person which has used that specific input, as the generation process can take days and more to be refined in order to archive what the artist has in mind, so to inspire others in a cause, emotion and more. People that take inspiration from the work an AI generated media, and created another original work by traditional means, should not be required to only use inspiration from non-copyrighted artworks, as an AI generated artwork should not be required to do such thing.<br/><br/>This creates a loop,<br/> ... -&gt; TRADITIONAL -&gt; AI -&gt; TRADITIONAL -&gt; AI -&gt; ...<br/><br/>To the point that no single artist can be sure to not infringe any copyright via inspiration, and must be sure that nothing, absolutely nothing, is driving its creation, if not personal experiences, and things that has been seen in person or in dream. Dreams should also not take into account copyrighted material, else it would be copyright infringement at artwork creation time.<br/><br/>I hope you see my point.<br/>I oppose the differentiation between AI generated and Traditionally generated, as I consider the thing illogical and harmful for both parties, traditional and digital.<br/>Thanks for your attention.
