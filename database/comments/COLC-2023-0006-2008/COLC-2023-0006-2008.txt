Artificial Intelligence (AI) creating artworks (music, writing, visual art) violates copyright law by often stealing works without the artists permission, and generates artwork using the explicit likeness of those artists, and usually is often sold as a service to people. This AI artwork often damages the income of millions of creative individuals who want to make a living on what they love to do. A specific example of an artist that is already being affected is Greg Rutkowski. &quot;At first, Rutkowski considered his newfound popularity on the A.I. platforms an avenue to new audiences. But when ran a web search of his own name for other reasons, works in his style he&rsquo;d had no hand in making turned up.&quot; (https://news.artnet.com/art-world/a-i-should-exclude-living-artists-from-its-database-says-one-painter-whose-works-were-used-to-fuel-image-generators-2178352) This said from a popular artist can only hurt smaller artists by preventing them from getting properly shared. Another thing mentioned in the article is &quot;&#39;A.I. should exclude living artists from its database,&#39; Rutkowski said, and instead &#39;focus on works under the public domain.&#39; He adds that &#39;there&rsquo;s a huge financial issue in evolving A.I. from being nonprofit research to a commercial project without asking artists&#39; for permission to use their work.&quot; In the article it says that the license agreement for specifically stability.ai absolves them from any responsibility, and instead makes users of it go by a copyright moral code that isn&#39;t really enforced. The article also explains these issues way better than I could, but please consider AI art as a violation of copyright law.
