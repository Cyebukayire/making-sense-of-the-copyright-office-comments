AI actively is ruining jobs requiring creatives, such as artist, animators, writers and voice actors. AI art and writing scrapes and uses other peoples work without consent and corporations (Such as Adobe and MidJourney) steal peoples hard work, AI is also being used to scrape from written works being put out online for free without credit nor consent. AI voices are being used to steal peoples voices to either make the person they stole it from look bad or to interject it into pornography with no consent from the stolen party. AI is also being used to create what is basically revenge porn of people by creating images of people online mashed into porn. It is incredibly cruel to the creative people suffering due to AI stealing their jobs, their hard work and identities.
