I believe AI needs to be regulated and potentially banned for use in certain fields. AI within creative fields is ripe for copyright infringement due to the learning models they use. They have to use pre-existing content; whether it be modeling after a voice, using pre-existing music to create a song, using art or videos to create visual art, or using pre-existing written work to write a story. All of these use other people&#39;s art forms and delve into the possibility of stealing some one elses intellectual property. AI has also been used by many students to cheat on essays or school projects and plagiarize other people&#39;s works. All of these are things that need to be regulated, monitored, and potentially banned for use in professional fields.
