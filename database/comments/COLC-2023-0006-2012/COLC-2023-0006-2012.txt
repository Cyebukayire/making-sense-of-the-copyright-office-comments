i think that the nature of &quot;ai art&quot; and specifically how it takes information from other preexisting art violates the copyright the preexisting art holds. its different from the natural human creative process that sees preexisting art and is inspired to create something from that idea because ai isn&#39;t even actual &quot;intelligence&quot;, its just computer learning. its pattern recognition, taking preexisting art and analyzing it before reproducing the qualities consistent with good art. art is a reflection of its creators inner world, even for artists that paint hyperreal portraits or landscapes, theres always a bit of their soul in that art. ai by definition doesn&#39;t have a soul, it just takes bits and peices of other artists souls from their work and shoves them together into something resembling human. and so often these artists didn&#39;t consent to their work being scraped or fed into the ai, meaning a part of their soul is stolen so a machine can take their jobs (a machine that wouldn&#39;t be able to do what it does without their art). <br/><br/>art has always been abstract and inherently human, so it would obviously be one of the most difficult things to replicate with exclusively machines. ai art has not accomplished that, it just steals from art made by people to pretend to be smarter than it is. and its unchecked reign is severely damaging to actual human artists who already struggle making a living and keeping proper claim over their work.
