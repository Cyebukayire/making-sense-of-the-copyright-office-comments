I am an artist with 20 years of professional experience, highly skilled, and fine with the existence and usage of generative AI tools. This is a sentiment shared by many, though not all, of my fellow artists at the company I work for.<br/>I believe the evolution of this technology is inevitable and critical for the continued significance of the United States as a world leader. <br/>Citizens should have liberal access to it, so they may become a part of developing the world of tomorrow.<br/><br/>Moreover, I am also puzzled as to why some fellow artists would take opposition with the training of styles in generative AI, considering that our stylistic development as artists has always involved borrowing and learning from one another. Copyrighting styles seems not only impossible, but entirely counterproductive to our ability to operate freely as artists, and for the well being of our industry.
