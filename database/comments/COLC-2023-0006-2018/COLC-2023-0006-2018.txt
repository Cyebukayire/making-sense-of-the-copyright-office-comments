It is so disappointing art AIs are made for money. The entertainment industry is one of the richest and making easy to steal and train this structures has made a deep impact in our industry. If it was made for artists, we should have the decision to be involved or not instead of having our work used without asking. Access to the web is for everyone, that does not mean it&#39;s everyone&#39;s property. I really hope they erase their entire data training and start over the way it should, with commercially free images or buying the proper copyright for those who want to be part of the project. <br/><br/>Making new digital seals or signatures to avoid copycats, regulate and not allow people to make money from ai images. Pay to the damaged artists.<br/>As artist, not only my work has been influenced by the new ai tools but also my motivations. It&#39;s way more difficult to find sense in making something the tool can do with 0 human effort. And without regulations,  the future and the expectation of our career seems blurring than ever. But that might be more like a personal concern.<br/><br/>What is clear is we shouldn&#39;t think as AIs like something completely out of control. The companies that did them have the control on them and they choose to steal (taking without permission) most of the greatest creative pieces of our era and that shouldn&#39;t be unpunished.
