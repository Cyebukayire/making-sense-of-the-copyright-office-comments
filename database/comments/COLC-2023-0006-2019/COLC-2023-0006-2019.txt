Please get at the crux of the matter:<br/><br/>Copying copyrighted works into a dataset  used commercially to train ML models that compete in the original authors&rsquo; market &ndash; this is copyright infringement. <br/><br/>We appreciate the nuanced questions raised by the Copyright Office. But if copyright is to be enforced in both the spirit and literal implementation of the law &ndash; this needs to be addressed. This would be a historic decision by the US Copyright Office. <br/><br/>Please act to uphold copyright.
