AI currently is being used to avoid paying artists and writers, diminish customer service and results in interactions devoid of human warmth. It&#39;s a parasite that is scraping other people&#39;s work and then refusing to pay them.<br/><br/>I think the use of AI needs to be heavily regulated, with writers and artists paid proper compensation when their work is used, especially if their work is used to train AI. <br/><br/>Ultimately I think anything produced by AI should be ineligible for copyright. A recent court ruling found that a human creator was necessary for eligibility for copyright. AI isn&#39;t making art, it&#39;s a machine randomly mixing scraps of human ingenuity and spitting out a result. Ruling these machine produced copies as both ineligible for copyright and not, in themselves, worthy of being considered art is the most sensible thing to do.
