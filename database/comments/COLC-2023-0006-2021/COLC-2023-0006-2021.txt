Hello. I had something to say about AI.<br/><br/>AI, to me, is a rapidly advancing technology that is dehumanizing and poised to replace hardworking people with automated processes that isn&#39;t human. One of the most impacted jobs today that were caused by AI is writers and artists.<br/><br/>To be able to generate something, AI learns by using other people&#39;s work. This is essentially plagiarism and stands afoul of copyright. We need to regulate this technology as soon as possible and make sure that technology doesn&#39;t disrupt things any further.
