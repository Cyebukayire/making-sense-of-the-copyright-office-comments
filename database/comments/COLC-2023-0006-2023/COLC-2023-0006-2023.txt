AI art utilizes the work of artists across all digital mediums, usually without their consent. This creates frustration and upset in artist communites, especially of those who use art as a source of income. With this non-consensual AI usage of art, artists find it more difficult to obtain income as people will input the artist&rsquo;s works into an AI platform and obtain art for free that the artist did not receive compensation for or consent to. <br/>Platforms such as ChatGPT in which college students create essays with AI algorithms prevent learning and retention of knowledge, making those with degrees and proof of expertise more likely to be under-educated in their field of study and thus incompetent in professions such as medical health and engineering.
