I wanted to share my perspective on how the current AI model is unethical. The majority of the model is trained on the data they scraped on the internet and most of the art they scraped are without the consent of the artist behind the artwork and then these model are sold for profit to the public. I think AI tech is a phenomenal tool but only when the data is used with the consent of the artists and the artist are compensated with proper credit
