Artificial Intelligence or AI as it is known can be a fantastic tool if in the right hands but right now unregulated as it is it can also be dangerous. As a creative I am concerned for the implications in art and writing but as a citizen I am far more horrified concerning the use of AI in creating artificial VOICES- as in the use of Voice clips to perfectly capture voices to more or less make them say anything they want,the same argument can be used for the use of faces and body movements by use of unconsenting pornography i.e. &quot;revenge porn&quot; that could now be far more than single still photographs altered in Photoshop. It is a dangerous dangerous slope AI is heading towards and as a citizen I implore the government to get more of a hold on this issue concerning voice and faces as well as creative arts. Machines were made to aid humanity in needing to do less work but now uncapped corporate greed threatens to make it so humans must work while machines &quot;play&quot;. It is backwards and obscene. Artificial Intelligence needs to be *unprofitable*. Period.
