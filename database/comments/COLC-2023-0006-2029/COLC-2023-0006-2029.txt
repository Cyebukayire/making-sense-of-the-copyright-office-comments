As an artist and software engineer, I feel very conflicted by the advent of AI art and how the art community has reacted to it. I think that art is an important aspect of human expression that needs to be protected and cherished, and I also believe that typing in a prompt and having an image generated should not be protected in the same way that a human&#39;s result of love and dedication to their craft should be.
