There&#39;s nothing morally correct about stealing. There is no law made or discussed that should condone THEFT. This technology was created by people who deliberately stole works. Developers who didn&#39;t want artists to know what they were doing. Once we found out last year, they started mocking us and telling us their tech would take our jobs,  which they were correct. This &quot;tech&quot;, built on stolen work, has cost my friends and myself our jobs this year. And the &quot;AI&quot; developers CONTINUE to scrape our artworks to feed their systems. This flagrant abuse of creative rights must END here. I don&#39;t have a degree in  fine arts for nothing! I use that knowledge everyday to create the artwork I make. I didn&#39;t get into art...just to be forced out of my own occupation.
