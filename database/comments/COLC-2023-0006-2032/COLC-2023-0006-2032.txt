I am not a U.S citizen, however, I know that if legislation allowing A.I to scrape and peel the very thing that keeps us human, there will no longer be a need for art. And how sad would that world be?<br/><br/>Imagine no music, not even the funny sounds coming over the speakers in the supermarket<br/><br/>None of the movies you&#39;ve watched that made you feel seen - heard - in a way that maybe saved your life<br/><br/>No more picture books for grandparents to read to their grandchildren, becoming cherished memories before too long<br/><br/>If you allow A.I to dominate the arts, you will find yourself lacking in humanity, beauty, and the brilliance we take for granted in our day to day life
