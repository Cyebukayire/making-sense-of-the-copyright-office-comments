Copyright Material &amp; Training Inclusion<br/>There should be no inclusion of copyrighted material without clear licensing and use requirements on for AI training model inclusion, regardless of the AI&#39;s intent of usage (commercial, non-commercial). This should be opt-in and require agreement with the specific copyright holder(s) to ensure all parties understand the use and rights of use. Doing so will prevent training &quot;bias&quot; wherein copyrighted materials which have not been licensed or their copyright holders duly informed and compensated. Agreements should include royalties for all uses of the AI that has utilized the copyrighted material in training based on the percentage of the training material was the copyrighted material (the ratio of which is updated with each new scrape/training exposure).<br/><br/>All scrapes/training materials should be on an opt-in basis, regardless of copyright, to prevent the invasion of privacy that is inherent when an AI indiscriminately scrapes data.  Information being publicly available for consumption does not mean inherently meant it is available for USE.
