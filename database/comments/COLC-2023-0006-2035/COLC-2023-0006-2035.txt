I have multiple concerns about AI, including most of the art generators have been trained on scrapings of the internet without permission of the original artist.  They were not provided permission nor paid for their work to be included in the data set.  It&#39;s THEFT.  Another issue is the same with chat generators like Chat GPT the data set was also scrapped from the internet without the permission including but not limited to public social media postings, newspapers, free novels, and fanfiction. Again no permission asked and no one was paid for their work that they are trying to profit off of. Art whether written or painted should be squarely left in the creation of human hands, and should be the only output that is copyrighted.
