As Ai generated work becomes more and more relevant in our society, it worries me as a young artist because my job opportunities might severely decrease before I&#39;m even able to get well developed into my career. Ai generated work is stealing. It should be destroyed.<br/>I have a very unique style of artwork, Ai would never be able to mimic the unique hand and creativity I illustrate with. artificial intelligence doesn&#39;t have a hand, brain, or emotions to have its own unique creativity. I hope Ai does not progress into something larger than us as artists because it will ultimately take away the diversity, creativity, and real human approaches to creating I believe the important thing now is coming together as artists and stopping it before it gets too far advanced or rather, putting guidelines and laws onto what Ai is allowed to steal and use.<br/>. I can only hope that social media sites such as pinterest, instagram, etc.. come out with a feature that allows creators to deny access to Ai in all forms, maybe an invisible watermark that Ai is not able to scan, or something of that nature. <br/>
