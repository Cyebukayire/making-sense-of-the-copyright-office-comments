As a writer (albeit a fanfiction writer) I think that AI and their owners should need permission of the site, or better yet the author of the work, that they train off of. <br/>Also, as a fanfic writer using copyrighted chanracters under the free works and transformative use law, I cannot copyright nor publish work for monetary value. For AI to be able to do essentially the same thing-- take &#39;inspiration&#39; from across the interweb and &#39;create&#39; or rather remix the data into something vaugely original that their creator/owner could copyright/sell is a slap in the face. I have worked for years. Poured blood, sweat, and tears, into my work out of love with no profit other than satisfaction of a well written story. For the AI to do the same in seconds and get *paid* and copyright privileges would be disheartening to me, as well as other creators.
