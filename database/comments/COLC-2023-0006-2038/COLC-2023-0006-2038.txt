I believe that the copyright of generated works should go to whoever owns the copyright to the material used in training and the dataset. Copyrighted data should not be used for training without permission. If copyrighted material is used with permission, the resulting generated product should require separate permission. Services that offer generative products should have clear agreements between the service and the dataset copyright holder before copyright or other permissions can be given to the service customer.<br/><br/>This comment is phrased with image, text, audio, and video generative AI in mind, but should be applicable to any other generative AI systems that require training on a dataset.
