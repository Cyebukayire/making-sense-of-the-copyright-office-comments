I am wholeheartedly of the belief that anything made through the use of artificial intelligence should not qualify for copyrighting, as it ultimately derivative work created through analysis of an incalculable number of bites and using that as the basis for the AI-made work.<br/><br/>Furthermore, to make it qualifiable for copyrighting would be harmful to thousands of people who make their living on making copyright-able works for others (i.e. scriptwriters, artists, musicians, etc.)<br/><br/>Those two are my main concerns: it&#39;s derivative and causes job issues.
