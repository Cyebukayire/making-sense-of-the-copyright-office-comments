First, I appreciate the Office&#39;s interest in the public opinion on this topic regarding AI and copyright. Thank you for taking the time to read our commentary.<br/>I am an aspiring writer, not yet published, who fully intends to publish my work for the public. However my willingness and ability to do so is hampered by the current open-season of AI training, not to mention the number of people who have been scraping other people&#39;s work and then publishing AI-written books, based on those scraped works, for their own profit.<br/>The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.  This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.  Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright.<br/>It is my opinion and hope that the Copyright Office will adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/>Thank you for your time and consideration regarding this matter, and for taking steps to protect artists of all types and crafts.
