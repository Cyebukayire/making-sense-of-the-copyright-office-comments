AI should not be allowed to use copyrighted material in any sense for the same reason I can not take a copyrighted image, copy paste it into a picture, and call that art.<br/>Artificial intelligence is a misnomer, it isn&#39;t intenegent on its own. It can not create anything from its own thoughts. Its machine learning, its an advanced copy paste tool in every form. Visual arts, literature, and even programming.<br/>If I, as a programmer, have to site my sources, have to prove I did not plagiarize something when its only just similar to my own work: why does the person who tells a machine to do it not also held to the same standard?<br/>These AI are not doing things willy nilly for fun, they are created by humans, used by humans, and defined by humans.<br/>Copyright law should apply in full when a machine does just as when a human does it.
