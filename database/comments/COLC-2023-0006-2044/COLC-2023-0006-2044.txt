The concept of consent cannot be understood by a machine. Artificial generation of text, art, or any other medium requires no skill, no talent, and is not the hard work and passion of an individual or studio, but the theft and desecration of others&#39;. Using copywrited works as training data is a violation of consent, ethics, and dare I say humanity. It is plagiarism. It should be a punishable offence. Similarly, artificially produced works must not be allowed to be copywrited. We must save creative arts and prevent a future of &quot;monkey on typewriter&quot; computer systems replacing humanity&#39;s oldest skills.
