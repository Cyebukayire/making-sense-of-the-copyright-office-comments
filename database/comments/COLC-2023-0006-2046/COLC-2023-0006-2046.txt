I have two conflicting opinions. One, AI is a product, and so too is training data, so training data must be bought and sold instead of skimmed. To not pay the people who made the intellectual property that is now part of your product is theft.<br/><br/>On the other hand, one can use the analogous case of artists seeking inspiration. However, I would argue that those artists transform subsequent works more than machine learning does, adding value, whereas machine learning often stitches together various articles with only slight changes in phrasing and content. Doing many small acts of plagiarism and then combining them does not make it not plagiarism.<br/><br/>I believe that people must given consent for their works to be used as data for training AI, and ideally must be compensated for their intellectual property.
