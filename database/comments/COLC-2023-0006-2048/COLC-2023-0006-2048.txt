AI models trained on someone else&#39;s work WITHOUT permission from the original creator should have no merit. Regardless of whether or not said work is copyrighted. It&#39;s plagiarism, plain and simple. I do believe in the promise that AI holds for us, but that promise is hindered by the inevitably exploitative way that it will be used if fully AI-generated content is allowed to be copyrighted without any protective measures in place.
