Hello,<br/>I myself am not an artist who would be affected by AI, but I have grown up around and am friends with many artists who have been and will be. As I&#39;m sure you are aware, artwork of any kind is a very personal practice, and beyond capturing a piece of the artist&#39;s mind via a medium of choice, it is also the basis upon which many individuals attempt to support themselves (I say attempt because it is often not lucrative during their lifetime, but rather is a legacy they can pass on to their family and loved ones). Allowing AI to infringe upon artist&#39;s rights by essentially forging art in their style and distributing it to the publics is tantamount to allowing counterfeit money into circulation - it dilutes the earning capacity across the board and makes a mockery of the nation at large. Please do not fall sway to the lobbyists and corporations who do not wish to pay a fair amount for artwork and would instead rather steal from the artists. Not only is it just plain wrong, but it supports industries which, by their admission that they cannot afford the commodity (i.e. artwork) that they &quot;need&quot; to succeed in their business, have admitted that their business is not viable as it is not able to sustain itself without fraud and corruption. <br/>As I said, I am not an artist, but I cannot in good conscience stand by quietly while corporations attempt to steal the heart, soul, and livelihood of those who are. Please, please do not allow AI the right to copy, steal, recreate, or in any way synthesize the work of real life artists who spend their time and effort on creating unique works. As dramatic and hyperbolic as it may sound, the point stands - paying to steal someone&#39;s soul will only damn your own in the process.
