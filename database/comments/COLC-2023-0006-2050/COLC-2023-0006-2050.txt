AI training models should be opt-in only. <br/><br/>I shouldn&#39;t have to tell an AI company not to take my work and intellectual property without permission (in other words, steal it), they should have to ask for it or give me the opportunity to decide how I want to license my IP, or how I want it to be used. This already exists in other forms of work - I can&#39;t simply use any photograph or song off the internet without proper licensing. I can&#39;t walk into any store and take whatever I want without paying simply because it&#39;s there on display. Why should it be any different for AI? Some platforms have already taken my work without consent, compensation, credit, or transparency and have profited off my property without me seeing a cent. People should be given the choice (opt in) at all times. <br/><br/>Further, AI generated images, texts, and other forms of media should not be eligible for copyright. Copyright should always require human authorship. The notion that AI generated media should be eligible for copyright is like saying that common phrases should be eligible for copyright, or that one should be able to type in &quot;what is the local weather?&quot; in a Google search and then be able to copyright the search results. <br/><br/>AI output should also be regulated. AI should not be allowed to generate the likeness of a person (from their appearance, their voice, their performances, and other unique aspects) without their consent, compensation, credit, and transparency. This is not just an issue of making unlicensed content of famous figures like actors and singers, but can easily be used to spread false and harmful information about everyone from political figures, to private individuals. This can be used to scam others on a large scale.
