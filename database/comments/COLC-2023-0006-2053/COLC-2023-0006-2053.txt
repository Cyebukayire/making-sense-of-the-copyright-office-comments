Hello, I&#39;m a citizen of Florida. I want to express the importance of protecting human artists and creators from the negative effects of AI. AI models that wouldn&#39;t exist without the input of vast amounts of human-created art or text, can generate a &quot;good enough&quot; replacement for things that used to be made by qualified people. This is really cool when computers can create something that wouldn&#39;t otherwise be worth creating, but it also has a huge chilling effect on artists and creators of all kinds, because anyone who is looking for the cheapest solution will prefer to use AI and creators are not compensated for the AI&#39;s use of their creations in training data. There are also issues for consumers, because it&#39;s much cheaper to use AI than to actually write a book. Amazon is full of low-quality AI-generated books and I would not buy a self-published book from the last year or two. I suspect YouTube is also getting an influx of videos made with AI-generated scripts, computer-generated narration (the quality has improved a lot lately), and keyword-relevant images and clips. AI chatbots have demonstrated how AI can easily incorporate completely fabricated information, so consumers having no idea what is and isn&#39;t made by AI is dangerous at worst and a waste of our time and money at best. It is a difficult issue because there is no reliable way to determine what is AI generated, but please protect the rights and livelihoods of human creators and consumers.
