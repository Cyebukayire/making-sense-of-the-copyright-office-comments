Hi, thanks for listening to comments on this subject! As a hobbyist author in a community including many authors and artists who live at least partially off their work, I have strong opinions on the use of AI.<br/><br/>If I&#39;m being honest, I believe these sort of AI should be illegal to share the output of publicly&mdash;possibly even illegal to use/create&mdash;at all, due to detrimental effects on art communities and to their capabilities of creating realistic imitations of specific real people. But I know that&#39;s not going to happen, nor is it what you&#39;re looking for comments about.<br/><br/>However I do feel that the answers to questions about copyright are obvious:<br/><br/>Using copyrighted works to train AI? Should not be allowed. It&#39;s quite obfuscated, but what AI is, on a fundamental level, is a complicated process of copying. Feeding a copyrighted work into an AI violates that copyright, but any reasonable definition.<br/><br/>This means the question of disclosure with regards to use of copyrighted works is entirely irrelevant, unless there&#39;s a grandfather clause for AIs trained before training on copyrighted works was declared illegal. Which, to be clear, there shouldn&#39;t be. But, if it&#39;s decided otherwise, the bare minimum level of protection is full disclosure as to whether the AI was trained in copyrighted works.<br/><br/>As for AI-generated works, I&#39;m a little shakier on the justification, but I believe they shouldn&#39;t be copyrightable as they are not created by people. However, this does raise thorny questions of where you draw the line, which I don&#39;t have answers to.<br/><br/>There is a much easier line to draw, however, which is that any AI trained on inputs with stipulations in their licenses&mdash;for example, a Creative Commons Share Alike license&mdash;must have their outputs follow these stipulations, for exactly the same reasons as AI should not be trained on copyrighted works. Thus, any AI that is not trained wholly on public domain or CC0 inputs cannot have its outputs copyrighted.<br/><br/>... exceptions to the rules about copyrighted inputs may be made for the owner of the copyright, of course. Although I believe disclosure of the use of these copyrighted works should still be required.<br/><br/>That&#39;s all I have to say on the subject.
