AI is horrible. I don&rsquo;t want it, it worries me more than just about anything else, and given the choice I would never spend a dime on anything AI made, and I can and do take the time to make sure what I&rsquo;m looking at was not created by AI. It&rsquo;s a threat to the entire creative world, and I have no interest in giving it any leeway. I want it gone for good. The only thing it will do is replace human creativity with a bad cheap version of what it thinks we can do.
