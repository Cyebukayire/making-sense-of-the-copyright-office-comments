The U.S. Court has already declared that AI Art cannot be copyrighted. I hope we can go forward with this and protect all artists, writers and creatives from AI generated work taking jobs away from them. It takes jobs away because if a publisher decides to create an AI generated book cover, they don&#39;t have to pay anyone to design it, for example. This is so detrimental, art is crucial to the human experience and it deserves fair protections under the law. Artists are workers, and they deserve to be paid fairly just as all workers do. Without artists, the entertainment industry as it stands will not survive. AI generated art will kill interest in anything being made. Humans will seek out human-created art and the government should not allow corporations to ignore this. It is also in the corporations&#39; best interest to hold on to artists and writers, because consumers will follow them.
