AI should not be permitted to train on written works or art without explicit permission from the author or artist. Websites that host such content should give users the ability to opt IN to permitting AI scraping, but that setting should not be the default.  Default should be no AI scraping.  <br/><br/>AI is a machine that is used by humans, therefore the human operator should, in my opinion, be at fault for an AI that trains or mimics any work without being granted consent to use. Any AI system found to have been trained on stolen work should be shut down and the developer fined the same as if they had plagiarized the works with their own hand. The operator of the AI, not the developer, should be at fault because the developer cannot control how users access their system.<br/><br/>A list of works used to train the AI should be kept in a file on hand so that credit can be given as needed. It may not be feasible to list all sources each time the AI produces more data-generated content, but that information should be available immediately to anyone who requests it.<br/><br/>All AI generated works should contain a clearly visible disclaimer stating that the work was generated by an AI machine, to help prevent misuse of AI for spreading false information.<br/><br/>Operators who use AI to copy likenesses of individuals for pornographic use without their consent should be accountable to the law in the same way any other non-consensual pornographic distribution would be handled. AI that violates privacy, slanders an individual&#39;s name, places them in danger, etc. should be illegal and punished to the appropriate extent of the law.<br/><br/>Plagiarism by AI should be handled as other plagiarism would be, in which cases the operator of the AI would be at fault.<br/><br/>AI scraping is theft unless it is explicitly given permission.  AI scraping without written, explicit consent, should therefore be treated the same as theft and operators of such AI should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
