I work in the publishing industry and I&#39;m very concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. AI is stealing creative work made by actual people, resulting in loss of jobs and violating intellectual property. If AI continues to be unregulated, it could be risky even for young minors as AI has stolen their faces and put them in inappropriate and illegal danger. Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
