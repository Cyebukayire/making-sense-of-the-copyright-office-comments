I feel that if the ai generation is for fun and not making any money, then it should be okay to use. If the creators of the ai engines are making big bucks off of people generating, then who they sourced from should get compensation. Ideal would be that people voluntarily submit feeds to the training, so there is no accusations of stealing.
