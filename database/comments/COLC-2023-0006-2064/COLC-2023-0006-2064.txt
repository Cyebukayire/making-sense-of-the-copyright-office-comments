WHEREAS all current AI-produced content is built off of algorithmic base data acquired via dubious or nonexistent legal consent of the original artists and/or other copyright holders;<br/>WHEREAS website-owning companies across the United States are changing their policies to permit them the use of all images, video, and writing without exception as part of AI training databases, with the clear and obvious goal of circumvention or outright violation of current copyright law;<br/>THEREFORE it must be clear that the current iteration of AI-generated images, video, and text are of intended use to deny copyright holders the legal protections for their creations, for their property, and for their livelihoods;<br/>THEREFORE it is vitally important to never permit AI-generated text, video, or images to be granted any copyright protections under any circumstances.<br/><br/>It stands to reason that any law favoring AI-generation over true creators or copyright holders will by extension be used to remove the rights of privacy by making personal images corporate property; of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, by denying the actual creators of data source images the ability to use said images of their own accord for their professions or livelihoods if posted on any social media, even if not posted by said creators and/or owners of said copyright (which is itself a quagmire of ethical and legal concerns based on current copyright law); and in many easily calculable ways, makes defending the rights of actual creators and copyright holders immensely more difficult if not impossible. Even in the cases of internal AI-generation by academic institutions, media corporations, or even individual artists, the protection of copyright for AI-generated text, video, or images would make current legal standards of attribution nearly impossible to enforce.<br/><br/>THEREFORE it must be resolved that AI-generated images, video, and text, can never be granted any copyright protection.
