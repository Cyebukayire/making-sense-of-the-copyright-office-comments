Any text that is created by a person should automatically require explicit permission, and compensation if required, when used to train AI, as well as explicitly state the program&#39;s name and it&#39;s lack of human involvment when shared. Many authors, hobbyists in writing, or people who share conversations and stories are appalled at the idea of their work being stolen, due to there being zero creative input and being nothing but patterns of words strung together by a program. The primitive use of it has already created many unreliable and impossible to comprehend articles and journals of varying levels of seriousness. This technology if unregulated will make finding accurate information on anything near impossible, commercially take readers and attention away from the same writers it steals from with sub-par work, and fool readers and laypeople into thinking they are supporting and commissioning work from an actual person with limitations and experiences instead of a machine controlled by someone who created hours of work in a couple of minutes using stolen work, which is desingenuous.
