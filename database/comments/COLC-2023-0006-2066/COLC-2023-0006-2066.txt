The use of copyrighted materials in training &lsquo;AI&rsquo; learning systems and output systems is exceedingly dismaying. It will have a chilling effect on what people are willing to post of their art and other artistic works, knowing that someone will be able to feed it through an &lsquo;ai&rsquo; program and replicate their style and/or likeness. We as human beings need to step back and decide if we are willing to trade away all the art and artists we love for the ease of use and cheapness of programming that can only mimic what the human mind can create.
