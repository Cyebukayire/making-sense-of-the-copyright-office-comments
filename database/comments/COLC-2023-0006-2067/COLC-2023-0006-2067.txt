As an artist and writer, the exploitation of artists by artificial intelligence is one of the greatest tragedies of our modern era. I have had my writing stolen and used to train ChatGPT, and my art used to train Dall-E without my consent several times. Art theft in any other circumstances are punished under copyright law, why is it suddenly excusable when it is done by an A.I.?
