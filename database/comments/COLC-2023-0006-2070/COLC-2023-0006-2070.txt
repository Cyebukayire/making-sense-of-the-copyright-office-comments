I am submitting this comment on behalf of myself. I have been blind since birth, having only light perception in both eyes. This means that I can only sense light and dark, and have never been able to see shapes or colors. In 2018, I acquired my first iPhone and ever since that time I&#39;ve learnt a lot on it. I currently have 2 free apps on my phone which have the ability to scan things around me via the use of artificial intelligence. One of these apps has OCR (optical character recognition) capabilities as well. I am not that great with a camera yet, which should come as little or no surprise due to my disability. However, these 2 apps and others like them have greatly assisted me with daily tasks and I&#39;d therefore like to sincerely thank their respective developers. Additionally, I know I will get better at this with practice. I am therefore in favor of artificial intelligence and language-learning models. Thank you.
