AI is toxic and harmful. It steals from original artists and writers who work hard and are trying to make a living just so some company can make thousands from a work that isn&#39;t theirs to take. AI content is unoriginal and often lacks flair, whether that&#39;s misshapen eyes, hands or a soulless story. It is disgusting that this enabled. Pay your creative workers fairly and encourage their creativity instead of deeming it as unnecessary or not worth doing. Without creative people, you would not have entertainment such as movies, books, music, art, revolutionary inventions and more. People matter more than money. Without these forms of entertainment and genius, life would be lacking. Students are also using it to cheat on their work, rewording it so they can get easy grades.
