Generative AI is a threat to not only the livelihoods of those who write and create, but to the existence of accurate, source-based information. AI cannot write from experience, it can only steal from others&#39; experiences and works. It is of paramount importance that generative AI is regulated and there are restrictions on what can be done with what is produced by AI. Work produced by AI should not be able to be copyrighted, and it is a copyright infringement for AI to use copyrighted works. To quote Katherine Forrest, former federal judge for the Southern District of New York and partner at Paul, Weiss in an interview with The Markup, &quot;There&rsquo;s no doubt that the entirety of the work is being copied [by AI], because that&rsquo;s the point of the ability to train a foundation model; you need the entirety of the work in order to determine the probabilistic relationship of one part of the work to the other. In other words, if you chopped it up so all you had were a few words here and a few words there, it wouldn&rsquo;t give you the information that you need, which is, how is this constructed. So we know 100 percent is copied.&quot; https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/04/22/copyright-showdown-ais-next-frontier
