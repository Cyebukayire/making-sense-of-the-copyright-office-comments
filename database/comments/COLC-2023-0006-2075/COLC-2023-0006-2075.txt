I am an artist and a writer. I&#39;ve taken my art down from every public site and have been avoiding posting any new work because AI is constantly increasing the amount of websites it scrapes content from without consent. It takes a very long time to master a unique art or writing style, and so many people have spent tens of thousands of dollars or more going to school just to learn these skills. The entertainment and novel industries are already attempting to take steps to replace their workers with AI to lower the cost of production. One of the main reasons the former is striking is to keep their jobs and have terms put in place that will prevent them from getting replaced. Any work contributed to training these machines deserves compensation and permission from the artists/authors at the very least. Without laws to prevent the stealing of these works, even google has been allowing these bots to scrape emails for content. Gmail is one of the most commonly used platforms for email, and I&#39;ve been unable to prevent the bots from stealing some of my writing simply due to no longer remembering the password on one of my accounts. Allowing the bots to continue scrubbing work with no laws to protect us will eventually destroy multiple industries. This could leave millions of people with years of proper training without any job opportunities.
