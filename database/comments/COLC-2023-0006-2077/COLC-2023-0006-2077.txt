As someone who values creative minds and literature (beautifully written literature both fanworks wise and original fiction), I think it&#39;s important for creative minds to be given their due. That means, artificially created pieces of fiction are lazy; what they have done, is essentially fed an idea (one which usually takes root inside the creative mind) into a computer program and the computer, programmed to spit out generic &quot;prose&quot; has written the piece of fiction. It&#39;s incredibly unfair to those individuals who take the time to choose the correct words, to search for an idea that really sticks with them, to convey the feelings of their characters to allow other people to copyright something they didn&#39;t spend time on is lazy. It&#39;s unfair to people who bleed onto pages, who wish to change someone&#39;s mind about something, who want to tell stories. Rod Serling described multiple times the follies of depending on technology; how one day, we would be obsolete as human beings, how certain occupations would disappear and people would grow lazy, they would waste away - how originality would be would be ignored. Not lauded.<br/><br/>Using AI to write, it&#39;s lazy. It lacks humanity. Do I think AI generated works should be given the ability to be copywritten? The answer is a resounding no. <br/>
