Ai is- VERY much a touchy subject, and I&#39;m glad that it&#39;s being put in the people&#39;s hands, since it very much effects us whether we like it or not. I&#39;ll try to address the different applications as best as possible. <br/><br/>First and foremost, AI &quot;art&quot;. While it could be a valuable resource, it&#39;s uncertain what models said AIs are trained off of. This unfortunately puts artists at risk of having their work stolen and used to feed an AI, many times without their knowledge or consent. Without proper limitations, this could mean that every piece of media out there is up for grabs, which poses extreme legality and ethical questions when smaller artists are caught in the crossfire. <br/>And the same goes for AI writers, too. We, the public, need to be made completely aware of what these AI models are being trained with, so that way we can better protect the artists and writers who depend on this for a living. We, the public, need to be informed of how these AI applications are being used in their respective fields, so that they don&#39;t overpower and shadow the people who depend on those jobs to make a living. While AI can be a very powerful resource, and one that undoubtedly is going to change the landscape of how we as a people do things, proper protections and copyrights need to be implemented sooner rather than later, to both protect the people, but also to let these AI programs grow in a way that&#39;s healthy to the environment and society that created them in the first place. <br/><br/>The ethics of AI-generated art, by Makhabbat Amanbay at SSRN.com-<br/>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4551467
