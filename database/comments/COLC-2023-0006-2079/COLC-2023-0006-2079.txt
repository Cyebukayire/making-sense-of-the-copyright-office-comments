AI generated art is usually built by feeding the program copyrighted materials. While the output is a unique creation, the artists used in its training are almost never credited nor made aware that their art is being used in this way. Artists should be given credit as sources for the AI&#39;s training and, when used for profit, should be provided a royalty. The exception to this bring artists who opt out of being credited or paid, or artists whose work is produced solely to train AI.
