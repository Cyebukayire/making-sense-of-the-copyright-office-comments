Having worked as an entertainment writer for several years, I have seen numerous elements of AI creep into the work. Some of this has been useful, such as basic grammatical checkers, but this has then evolved into the inclusion of AI-generated summaries, which take the work that has been written and instantly churns out a soulless imitation that removes all but the basic information. The biggest concern around this is that the evolution of AI does not seem to be slowing down. As more websites, writing tools and programs and search engines integrate AI into them, not allowing the option to opt out of their interference, it is clear that the path of AI creation is being pushed by big corporations with the ultimate aim of closing out the human aspect of writers in general. The continued advancement of AI is clearly heading towards a point when it can be used to produce cheap content that can be churned out continuously to generate clicks and google searches, leading to increased advertising profits and over-saturating of the available space for human writers to compete. <br/><br/>Overall, it is concerning to be in a position where there seems to be no culpability and no attempts to stem the increased use of AI, or the development towards it being the perfect tool to negate the need for human intervention, when profits would take precedent over people.
