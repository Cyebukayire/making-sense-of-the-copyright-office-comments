Copyright law in its current form is incredibly restrictive, protecting works that are no longer even available for sale, and for a period of nearly a century - often leading, combined with restrictions on copying, to their outright loss - and needs significantly stronger exemptions for noncommercial use. <br/><br/>Even commercial use of copyright has led to a stifled culture, as media conglomerates purchase exclusive rights to beloved legacy characters; compare the many different incarnations of Sherlock Holmes or fairy tale characters to Disney&#39;s abysmal stewardship of Star Wars, or Amazon&#39;s poor handling of the Lord of the Rings. All while the incomes of authors themselves, the people who copyright was supposed to protect, have diminished drastically, and online archives are criminalized and taken down on &quot;piracy&quot; charges; it seems unlikely as anything as straightforwardly good as the public library system could ever be created today.<br/><br/>Expanding copyright to encompass either AI-produced works or new categories such as &quot;likeness&quot; or &quot;style&quot; would be an even worse disaster than the abysmal system we have now.
