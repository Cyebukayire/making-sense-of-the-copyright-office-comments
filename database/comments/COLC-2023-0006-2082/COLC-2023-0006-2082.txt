Please take the AI&rsquo;s threat to human creativity seriously. We need to make sure this field is being regulated and restrained as needed. As a literature professor, I find so much of what I teach interesting because a human wrote it. The questions of ambiguity in the missing line of &ldquo;The Wife&rsquo;s Lament&rdquo; would not matter at all if it was an accident by AI. In no way do I want to ever read a novel written by AI. If places like Amazon want to support such trash, they should be required to mark it as written by AI at the very least. <br/>However, that should not even happen because AI is built off stealing other people&rsquo;s writing to begin with. I&rsquo;m also a writer, and someone could tell Chat to write in my style and it would try. It would be worse and pointless but someone could profit off that, which is wrong. This is especially infuriating because I write to publish my stories for free for all to enjoy. To imagine someone ripping them off to sell or profit is so frustrating. Please create some good regulations that would isolate AI fictive works altogether and to properly build the AIs where they did not merely steal everything on the internet. Thank you for your consideration.
