Specialized parts used in machines are often protected by patents. It does not matter that the machine will produce a different item than the specialized part: if someone uses a patented part in a machine without permission from the patent holder, they are in violation of the law. The training process of machine learning and AI uses input data as a tool to build a machine that will take original user input and create a desired output. It follow that if desired input data is copyrighted, permission must be granted from the copyright holder BEFORE use in the machine.
