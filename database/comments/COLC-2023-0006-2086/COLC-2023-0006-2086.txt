The AI scripts have scraped AO3, and as an author it&#39;s incredibly violating. Some things that I have written came from a very dark time in my life, with real pain and frustrations poured out into this work. Yes I let others read it, I put it out on the internet. I did that so my friends within the fandom could see that I needed help. And I got that help. Those stories stay up as a reminder of what I&#39;ve been though, how far my writing has evolved over the years. It is not posted so bots can come along and steal my work. Or even the people submitting my works to a program so they can get more content.
