My position on AI is nearly the current position of the US Copyright Office. Human involvement and human authorship as a condition of copyrightability is crucial to the continuation of artists, writers, playwrights, designers, and many more creative industries at large. The ability to copyright work as a human author is inherently a protection in the changing technology space.<br/><br/>As a creative person myself, I sympathize with other copyright owners and content creators&#39; concerns over their copyright content. From what I have witnessed over the past couple of years with the boom of AI, I have seen nothing but predatory practices and disregard for artistic value. AI systems, in regards to art, are consistently trained on copyrighted work from many unknowing creators. Those same systems are then tasked to produce AI-generated content and post them online through social media (ie: Twitter/X, Instagram) or artist-dedicated sites (ie: DeviantArt, Pixiv). Online platforms, where the unknowing creators and other human creators are trying to promote their own original content and potentially trying to make a living. It&#39;s a system that pits creators against an entity that uses their work without credit and a production rate higher than any human could hope to keep up with. <br/><br/>Likewise with AI-generated content, there is no transparency and no regulations to support this new climate regardless. Current systems are invisible to the common person, locked and hidden behind human-generated code and algorithms. Many of the popular websites for sharing creative works have little to no distinctions between AI-generated content and human-generated content. Deepfakes are often generated with AI. There is no federal crime right now to create and distribute deepfake AI pornography of non-consenting people. Should that and other similar deepfakes be copyrightable in the eyes of the Copyright Office? To me, I don&#39;t think they should be copyrightable nor legal.<br/><br/>AI is a lawless territory and by allowing AI-generated work to be copyrightable is not in the best interest of the Copyright Office at the moment. Opening up copyrightability to AI-generated work will open a whole new wave of pain and trouble that no one, not even the government or the common person, would be prepared to handle as it has been trying to catch up for the past few years.
