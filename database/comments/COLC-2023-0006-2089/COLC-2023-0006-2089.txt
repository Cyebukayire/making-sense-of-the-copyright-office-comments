Artificial Intelligence now poses a danger to nearly every job in society in that automated systems are taking over in every industry. It has always been a pillar of society functioning ethically to give credit where credit is due and now with AI threatening to create simply by analyzing and regurgitating existing material it is imperative that human creation be protected under the law on a global level. Therefore, AI generated content should not be allowed to be protected under copyright laws. AI at its core is a system which mimics or models after existing material. Furthermore copyright law should protect human created material from being copied/recreated or regurgitated by AI models. Human beings devote their lives to creation - sometimes we spend years and years honing our crafts, not to mention thousands if not millions of dollars for an education on these crafts so we can work in industries which profit off our creations. Most of the time it is a long shot if people even make back the money, years, tears, and sweat they&rsquo;ve put into their creations and for this to become even harder due to AI is deplorable and will see a death of something sacred in society. Labor is entitled to compensation and for creative work to be sold in any industry for profit means the creator has put labor into its creation and not only should be appropriately credited, but should be compensated appropriately.  Please never allow AI creations to be copyrighted or protected by copyright and please adjust copyright laws to prevent AI from being able to steal from human creators.
