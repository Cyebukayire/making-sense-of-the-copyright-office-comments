Hello! Anything created by AI should not be legally allowed to be trademarked or copywritten. Modern AI is not artificial intelligence, it is an amalgamation of all the things it has absorbed through other works. Especially with AI that creates any kind of art (visual, written, etc) there is always some sort of source material that belongs to the artists that make it. AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; is plagiarism and at the bare minimum it cannot be copywritten or allowed to produce money. Art is meant to be original ideas by human beings. AI does not support that.
