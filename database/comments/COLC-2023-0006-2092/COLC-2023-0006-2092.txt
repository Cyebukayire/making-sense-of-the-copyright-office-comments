AI should not be able to use people&#39;s artistic work or their physical likenesses or voices without explicit, limited, written permission. Using any artist&#39;s work or person&#39;s likeness that has not consented is theft and should be treated as such. Making it so images, video, text, and sound created by AI cannot be copyrighted disincentivizes large corporations from using AI as a tool to replace human workers.
