Thank you for giving us the chance to speak with you. Even if it doesn&#39;t seem it, this issue is an existential one for humanity as we know it, and it is critical that drastic action is taken to prevent the wanton exploitation of creators by billionaire-owned technology platforms.<br/><br/>I am a professional voice actor. Unregulated, unrestricted AI proliferation allowed hateful individuals to steal my own voice, feed it into their program, and use it to post a video online with my own voice speaking my name and my home address alongside disgusting racist slurs. Then they did it to a dozen of my friends too. VICE interviewed me in an article about it. https://www.vice.com/en/article/93axnd/voice-actors-doxed-with-ai-voices-on-twitter<br/><br/>This exact situation is happening in every form of the arts as we speak. The collected lifetime works of artists are being stolen en masse, scraped by bots from the internet, and uploaded to datasets and training models without compensation or artist consent (making an absolute mockery of US intellectual property law in the process). Musicians are finding their voices and performances perverted into new works featuring gross racist or sexual language. Artists are finding their artworks and portfolios being used to generate sexually explicit, even pedophilic content for the depraved. It&#39;s pervasive. It&#39;s rampant. It&#39;s evil and immoral. It must stop. And it must be stopped by banning these programs until protections are in place that govern their lawful use.<br/><br/>Moreover, this technology is allowing billionaires to steal and then burn the collective works of millions. It&#39;s not a coincidence that within a year or two of these programs coming online, suddenly Google, Youtube, and Twitter all decided to start purging the inactive accounts of dead creators. Essentially, they are giving themselves free pass to loot the life&#39;s work of these creators, and rather than pay royalties or usage to their families, they are stealing it and then burning the bridge behind them so that all digital traces of the original creator are destroyed, to prevent the likelihood of them having to pay for the future usage. https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-its-purging-inactive-accounts-what-you-need-to-know/<br/><br/>The most important question we as a society need to ask ourselves in the discussion of Artificial Intelligence is this:<br/><br/>What is the purpose of technology?<br/><br/>Take a moment to answer it for yourself. And then, think about what the utopian society looks like to you. At a base level, one might answer that a utopian society is one where every citizen has physical security assured and biological needs met. We need food, clothing, shelter, clean water, clean air, freedom from war, and meaningful relationships with loved ones before we can be happy and content. But beyond that point, what do humans desire and find meaning in?<br/><br/>Creation. Writing. Music. Art. Theater. Singing. Dance. Self-expression. And sharing all of it with the rest of our kind. Imagine how bleak and miserable a world without any of those human endeavors would be. <br/><br/>Historically, the progress of human advancement was designed to make production more efficient, to better provide for the needs of the populace. Only in the most recent few hundred years has that shifted. Labor is a necessity, not a purpose--no one is arguing that the farmer is being selfish or lazy for using a combine instead of a sickle, a tractor instead of a plough. Likewise, AI used for abatement of labor is good. That is the purpose of technology: to reduce the need for toil and labor and to improve the quality of our lives. <br/><br/>But we are not talking about the utility of Artificial Intelligence in labor. <br/><br/>We are talking about unregulated Artificial Intelligence being weaponized against human creators to render the most important part of what makes us human irrelevant, soulless, and obsolete. Or worse: to let billionaire technology owners steal, monetize, and sell the most personal and private thing a human has: their voice. (Whether that&#39;s their physical voice, or their ouevre, their stylistic voice.)<br/><br/>Make the right choice. Pass strict legislation banning all forms of generative AI content in music, the written word, the voice, and artwork, until ironclad protections can be created enabling the legislative infrastructure this issue needs, and enabling that artists can be compensated for their works. The entirety of human creation depends on it. The upholding of an artist&#39;s right to the sanctity of their own voice and their own work is more important now than ever. This goes far beyond mere identity theft and needs to be treated with that level of gravity.<br/><br/>Thank you.
