I am a writer, and I know many writers and artists. We are all deeply concerned with the free reign of AI models being allowed to access and learn from our work without permission or compensation. The art that human beings craft come from a place of empathy, wisdom, experience, and years of practice honing skills, and it is deeply damaging on a human level to a) group AI generated art in the same category and b) allow people without the same skills to profit off of bastardizations of personal and copyrighted work. Many artists and writers are being put out of work and treated as disposable because of this. It results in bad and disposable art and empty words that alienate people looking for meaning and connection and information. Beyond that, the lack of regulation allows for directly dangerous materials to be published as if they were fact (case in point: AI generated fungi identification guides that could cause people to poison themselves). I have personally experienced a chatgpt prompt spit out a piece that mimicked my own themes and style and it was deeply unsettling. I never gave permission for these learning tools to crawl over my work online and it feels like a violation. Even more chaotically, nothing can stop people from inputting others&#39; work directly into these tools. If these tools are allowed to continue existing and growing, there must be regulations in place that account for permissions given and/or compensation to those contributing.
