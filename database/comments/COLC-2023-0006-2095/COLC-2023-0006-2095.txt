I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in this topic and its request for public feedback. I am a supporter of authors and artists, and recognize that it is important in a democratic society to support the creation of art. There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.&nbsp; While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.&nbsp; To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies. The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training. Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.
