Iterative Generation - popularly known and marketed as Artificial Intelligence, or AI - is the latest in the popular field of technology that is not understood, and sold as something it isn&#39;t.<br/><br/>Iterative Generation is NOT Procedural Generation; it is NOT using pre-made pieces that fit together randomly.<br/><br/>Iterative Generation is NOT Artificial Intelligence, and never will be.  <br/>It cannot learn, or retain patterns. Much like an advanced form of the auto-complete function, each generation is an entirely new query that appears to be more accurate as you get closer to the desired results.<br/><br/>Iterative Generation is NOT interacting with the user. It is not &#39;asked&#39; for queries, and the popular use of these terms grants a cargo-cultish faith in it the technology does not have.<br/><br/>What Iterative Generation IS, is a long list of searches through data, and a return that is believed to closest match what the Generator considers the optimal result. This is often convincing enough to wow the technology-illiterate, thus granting the technology a patina of magical power.<br/><br/>What Iterative Generation IS, is theft on a massive scale. Voice, writing, art, are all taken and modified via bare minimum. It is possible to use reverse-image search technology on most artistic renditions will often lead to the first piece the generator essentially traces over.<br/><br/>What Iterative Generation IS, is a tool that has very little commercial or societal advantage. Because it cannot independently solve problems, it has no meaningful use. Adding more data to a so-called dataset does NOT make the Generator more knowledgeable about desired results; repeated Generations do not &#39;train&#39; the Generator, because the Generator is not intelligent, has no ability to store memory or context, and thus is useless in all the fields it is claimed to be useful in.<br/><br/>What regulations should be taken are a complete ban on all Iterative Generation processes, as well as appropriate actions for Iterative Generation software and the organizations behind them that have illegally seized the property of those who did not consent to be used in their &#39;training&#39; &#39;sets.&#39; <br/><br/>Privately; this field is a massive waste of time, and distracting an incredible amount of people from meaningful advances in the field of actual artificial intelligence, which - itself! - is likely a pipe-dream, but at least potentially of some use.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing of economic or cultural value in this technology. <br/>If it is not regulated harshly, without any exception, people will continue to ascribe mystical qualities to it, and themselves write like iterative generators do.
