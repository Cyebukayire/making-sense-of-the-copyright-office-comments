Thank you for opening public comment on this important issue. As a passionate reader and sometime writer myself, this is an issue I care about deeply. The copyright policy of this country has always been that artists retain exclusive rights to their works for a determined period, as laid out in the Constitution itself. I believe that allowing generative AI to train on copyrighted works would be violation of this principle unless done with the author&#39;s express permission, as &quot;exclusive&quot; excludes all, not just human beings. The Copyright Office should adopt this position and include the use of copyrighted works to train generative AI without consent under the definition of copyright infringement to protect the right of authors to control their work.
