AI is not made by a human, it is made by a machine, often from STOLEN materials. Keep AI OUT of copyright!! We creatives get out works stolen online often enough, and offering incentive to mass media and people to STEAL from us and profit is wrong and outright an affront to creatives and artists of all media. We are humans making things, not machines! Machines have NO PLACE in copyright.
