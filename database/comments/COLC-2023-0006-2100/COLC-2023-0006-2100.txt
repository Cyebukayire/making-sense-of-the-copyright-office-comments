Thank you for opening up this critical issue for comments. As a supporter of art of all kinds, I definitely oppose using copyrighted works to train AI. It is extremely important for our society, as with all democracies, to encourage artistic expression. If writers and creators of all types of art have their work fed to AI, it will discourage them from creating more. It is also my position that doing so would violate the Copyright Act. The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.  This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use it.  Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright. The Copyright Office should, therefore, find that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the creators of those works violates the Copyright Act. Thank you so much for considering my comment.
