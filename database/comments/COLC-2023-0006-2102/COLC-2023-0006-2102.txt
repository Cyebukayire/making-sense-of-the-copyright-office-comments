AI poses a great threat to artists, which have been notoriously exploited. The current WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes exemplify this. But, importantly, the laymen benefits from technology that allows well-crafted text or representative images to be at their fingertips. I am not educated enough on this matter to make a specific and well thought out suggestion, but I know AI images, text, and videos should not be copyrightable, and in my opinion they should have no part in the profits of large corporations.
