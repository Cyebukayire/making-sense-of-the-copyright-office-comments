Please don&#39;t allow AI to take copyright. First, AI is trained on existing material. Most of which is copywritten already and allowing what AI generates to be copywritten could devalue the entire system. In addition, several artists have had their entire portfolios online stolen without consent to train these generators. Opening yet another can of worms where some AI are built just to mimic existing artists and their art styles. <br/><br/>AI is a great thing when used as a tool, and I fully believe it could lead to great things not just for the US but for humanity as a whole.<br/>But given that several art and literature websites have had to implement functions to cull AI submissions after being flooded with quickly made garbage, I can&#39;t see giving people the option to copywrite AI-generated artistic material having any good effects at all.
