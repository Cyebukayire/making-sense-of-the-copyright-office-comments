I strongly feel that the data collected and used to train AI belongs to the users who created it, and to use it without their permission is theft.<br/><br/>This is true of copyrighted works, but it&#39;s also true of works which *cannot* be copyrighted. Many actors whose voices are now being used to perform works that they never agreed to or are paid for - the deserve to be able to say no, they don&#39;t want to be associated with that. They also deserve to be able to claim reenumeration for the use of their likenesses. Author&#39;s whose names are being claimed as writing AI generated books that they neither authorised nor wrote - their names are being associated with something they didn&#39;t lend themselves to, and they can&#39;t possibly copyright their own names, names that they may share with many other people.<br/><br/>Works being entered into an AI data training pool should require an opt *in* process in my opinion, and there should be detailed records kept as to what has been used in order to reenumerate the creators.<br/><br/>More, such agreements certainly shouldn&#39;t be hidden in the verbiage of a terms and conditions contract as X has recently done to everyone who is now using their platform.<br/><br/>All of this is wrong and everyone whose data was used did not agree to it before their creations were fed to these programs.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is that allowing AI to scrape data *without* limit will - and already *has* - led to criminal activity. There are people whose voices have been stolen off their social media accounts and fed to AI voice generators... and the products used to terrify their families with blackmail and threats of kidnapping.<br/><br/>This entire situation is beyond the pale, and stringent regulation needs to be put in place around it.
