AI is stealing content created by people and using it to bring revenue and profits to those who have not created any source material but are compiling it to create &#39;new&#39; works. I believe that without the artist&#39;s permission to use their work (unless it is for the public and NOT for a company entity or a company who claims to be a person) then AI should not have access to any and all works. Especially those works that have copyright, trademark, or any sign of ownership, whether it is a watermark or a signature. This should not be used as a way of artistry in any shape or form.
