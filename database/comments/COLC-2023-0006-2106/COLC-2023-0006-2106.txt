All AI systems should be opt-in NEVER opt-out. It&#39;s entirely unethical to include artists&#39; works in a database to generate similar content because it&#39;s using others&#39; works without payment while the AI profits off their unpaid, undonated labour. It would be very easy for opt-out systems to be overlooked and for work to be included by accident on the artist&#39;s part.
