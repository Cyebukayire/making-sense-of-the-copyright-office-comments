Organizations that own AI software are utilizing other&rsquo;s copyright material without consent or compensation. They are then profiting from it. How is this ok?<br/><br/>It feels like an invasion of privacy. We all have to opt-in to marketing materials and are constantly bettering our privacy stance. Companies have to buy this data from third parties or generate their own via opt-in models. However, if a company wants to use our copyright art to train AI models we have zero protection. They&rsquo;re literally just allowed to steal any work with no repercussions. Years of hard work from artists is just being utilized for free by for profit companies. This is not ok.
