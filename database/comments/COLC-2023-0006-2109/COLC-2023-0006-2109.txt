Thank you for allowing our voices to be heard. I am a supporter of authors and artists and feel their hard work should be protected from theft by corporations seeking to use AI technology as an end-run around copyright law. They can train generative AI on materials in the public domain, but it violates an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to allow generative AI to be trained on an author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright. Thank you for your time and consideration.
