AI is not sentient and therefore cannot create of its own imagination or free will. Just like you can&rsquo;t take a random photo off the internet and use it for your own profit, you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to mangle and merge others creations and profit off of it. Protections should always be made for nonprofit use (ie. fanart, fanfiction, and other fanworks), but corporations should not be allowed to just skim the internet so they don&rsquo;t have to hire someone. On that note, I also think there should be restrictions on using ai in place of humans. Again because ai cannot create of its own imagination and free will, therefore it will always use the created product of others to feed its algorithm to make content. TL;DR, ai doesn&rsquo;t get to skip around the rules that any other human artist has to play by, especially when the ai is owned by people who have plenty of money to hire a person to do it instead.
