Hello,<br/>I am a game developer and I find the current trend of AI training off of copyrighted material is a worrying prospect. The creators of these AI are more concerned with the &quot;end product&quot; than how we get there. A good AI tool should be helpful to artists and designers, removing backgrounds? Tedious, a great use of AI and AI training can be done on many free or stock photos easily purchased online. AI as a tool to generate images? This is a slippery slope to something dangerous. I would go so far to say it is already in dangerous territory. <br/><br/>Outside of the ability to create disinformation at an alarming rate and with increasingly alarming accuracy, the idea that you could, without someone&#39;s consent, take their entire body of work and create something like puppeting a marionette made of someone else&#39;s table scraps is morally reprehensible.<br/><br/>Besides being morally reprehensible, the justice system is clear, only humans may hold copyrights. A human is no more involved in the generation of an AI art piece than letting a monkey use their camera. If copyrighting of generative AI is allowed, where does it end? Are generative AI musicians going to be the next thing? What are they going to be trained on? Or AI generated animations and movies?<br/><br/>A copyright is a protection granted by the government, it may be my opinion that generative AI cannot be and should not be copyrightable, but the idea that the office would ignore the blatant infractions caused by the creators of AI when training their models is not something that should be allowed if we want copyright to mean anything in the age of tomorrow.
