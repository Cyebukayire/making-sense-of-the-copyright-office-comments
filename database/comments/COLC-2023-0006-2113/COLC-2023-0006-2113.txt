AI software , like most technological leaps, presents us with amazing new tools , but also new ethical choices. We , as a culture, cannot sit passively to the side while a small and entitled technocratic elite plunder our artistic patrimony, then attempt to pass off this fraud as original creative work. Mimicry is an amusing trick,  but it&#39;s not a substitute for creativity. To allow that is to feed our culture its own tail. I&#39;m excited by the new tools that will become possible,  but I want a greater cultural understanding to be sought, so that we don&#39;t impoverish our culture through apathy or lack of awareness. Technology should allow us to uplift ourselves and our society. Don&#39;t let it suffocate us with meaningless noise.
