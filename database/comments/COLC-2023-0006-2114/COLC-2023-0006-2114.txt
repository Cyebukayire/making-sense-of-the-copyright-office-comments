To be clear and upfront: AI generated content is stolen content.<br/><br/>AI cannot generate anything novel or unique, rather it collages together bits and pieces of art and literature scrapped from the internet - often without the consent of the true copyright holders - into a piecemeal facsimile of a unique thing. It is then claimed to be an original work - which it is not - and frequently sold for a profit, further violating the rights of the individuals who created the works that the AI generated content has stolen. Because these AI tools scrape the entire internet without informing anyone, copyright holders have no ability to opt out of this theft, and frequently no idea it&#39;s happened at all until they see their work frankensteined into something else.<br/><br/>Further, a recent court ruling (Stephen Thaler v. Shira Perlmutter and The United States Copyright Office) finds that human authorship as a fundamental perquisite for copyright. A program cannot hold the rights to something anymore than a dog can, and if we&#39;re saying that ownership or authorship of a piece of software dictates authorship of whatever is made with it, then I suppose Microsoft owns every single thing ever created using Microsoft Word.<br/><br/>Additionally, pressing a button or tying in a word does not equal creation or authorship. By that logic, I am the proud author of countless Google search pages, and so is everyone else. Copyright requires human authorship, and human authorship requires human effort.<br/><br/>We have already seen the negative impacts of AI - in the case of Mata vs Avianca, lawyers for the plaintiff used ChatGTP to do their research, which produced fabricated cases. On the academic side we are seeing students use AI to generate their essays, unaware that they&#39;re submitting completely false and contradictory information and risking their academic careers with a plagiarism charge in the process. AI is running artists out of business as the programs steal their work to be used for advertisements, book covers, and more, all without compensation. The usage of AI in film and the writer&#39;s room is one of the main grievances of the striking writers and actors unions.<br/><br/>AI was supposed to make our lives easier and take over menial tasks that no one really wants to do, anyways. Instead it&#39;s being used to steal our arts - in a world where AI is unrestricted the machines make easily consumable art while the humans toil away. That&#39;s not a world I want to live in.
