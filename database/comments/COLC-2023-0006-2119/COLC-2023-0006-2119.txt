As excited as we as programmers are for AI to continue to become robust and effective, we cannot forfeit our souls in the process.<br/><br/>AI are meant to mimic humans, and in doing so alleviate monotonous tasks and allow human-like intelligence to make decisions on a process where a human cannot be reasonably be present or fast enough to do so normally.<br/><br/>Content creation rarely, if ever, requires AI intervention. Years ago, we created art and stories without machines. Years forward, we will do the same. Young children will do so without prompting, as will every age and demographic. We create without incentive, because it is a human trait.<br/><br/>And AI do contribute heavily to this process in many areas, but an AI creation cannot be considered copyrighted unless you are willing to recognize an AI as a person.<br/><br/>I can save you some arguments on that front: we aren&#39;t at that point yet. Our AI is a fascinating and wonderful collection of logical statements, biased with every programmer hand that has touched it or gleaned data for it. The modern AI we have as of 2023 are tricky things meant to act like people, but we put on this facade for the sake of efficiency and effectiveness.<br/><br/>Behind the scenes, AI are what we imagine them to be. We feed them data that we select, we train them in simple, coordinated efforts. We censor them and teach them to speak in ways that can be as ambiguously human as possible, because they are meant more to be a means than an end.<br/><br/>We build AI as tools, and we need to remember that is what they are. An AI can amalgamate other artists&#39; work, but it cannot create art. An AI can inspire, but it cannot be inspired. An AI can produce a script, but it cannot write.<br/><br/>Do not let the tools we build harm the people who must wield them. We built these AI for good, do not use them to harm the dreamers of this world.
