I am a writer, hoping to get published one day and I draw as a hobby too.<br/><br/>I believe AI art is not copyright infringement. AI &quot;training&quot; on art and writing is no different from a human viewing and reading things to learn. AI does not use and mash pixels together as some believe. I think this source here is good for proving AI art isn&#39;t violating copyrights. https://thecodebytes.com/is-ai-art-theft/
