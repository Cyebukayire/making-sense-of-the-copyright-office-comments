Companies should not be allowed to use AI to create art that has been directly plagiarized from human artists! Artists and creators need to be paid for their work, and the development of AI has taken the humanity out of all different kinds of art. People need art to be happy, and AI will destroy that happiness. It is already destroying the job market for artists and creators. It should be used to solve actual problems, like poverty or global warming, instead of lining billionaires pockets with unpaid labor.
