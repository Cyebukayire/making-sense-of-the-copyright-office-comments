I have been a user of various AI platforms for the last few years now, even using AI to help myself in my own personal writings and even help advance my craft as an author. I, for one, hold the following beliefs. I do believe that AI can definitely shape and even refine human creativity, even in the confines of copyright law, as it is something that has helped me and many other amateur authors, and even other content creators on the internet in the last few years. AI has proven itself as an invaluable tool in many artistic and transformative endeavors that people have embarked on, whether it be creative writing, refining their artwork, or even creating their own content purely using AI. With extent to the argument of copyright, I hold the belief that if the content being used to train AI is freely available to the public, in the public domain, or qualifies under fair use, then I am of the firm belief that the developers of said AI models have the right to use that information and content to train their models, as these developers are not exempt from the right to freedom of information, and even fair use. However, if their usage does not fall under fair use, then it is the responsibility of this governing body to regulate that.<br/><br/>However, I am of the opinion that AI developers using datasets that contain copyrighted materials to train their AI models falls well under fair use. 17 U.S.C. &sect;107 defines the following conditions for fair use:<br/>1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;<br/>2. The nature of the copyrighted work;<br/>3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and<br/>4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<br/><br/>In relation to the content in this subsection, I believe that AI developers using even copyrighted content in their datasets falls under fair use for the following reasons alone: <br/>1. The use of copyrighted material is transformative, as it is used to create new and innovative AI models that serve various purposes, such as natural language processing, image recognition, or recommendation systems.<br/>2. The copyrighted material used for training AI models is factual and publicly available data.<br/>3. AI developers often use large datasets, but they typically do not use entire copyrighted works. They use snippets or segments, and the quantity used is often necessary for training purposes and furthering AI research.<br/>4. AI development does not compete with the original work and does not harm its market value. Instead, it creates new markets and applications for AI-based technologies and services.<br/><br/>Even in the realm of using AI technologies for commercial purposes, I am reminded of the Supreme Court case of Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. (1994). The landmark case of Campbell provides important guidance on commercial fair use. In this case, the Supreme Court held that even a commercial use of copyrighted material can be considered fair use if it is transformative and does not harm the market for the original work. AI developers&#39; usage of copyrighted material, even for commercial use, meets the Campbell test. Their primary purpose is to create new and transformative content rather than substituting for the original work.<br/><br/>In closing, I am of the firm belief that AI developers using copyrighted materials in the training of AI models and furthering AI research falls under the confines of fair use. As I stated in my first paragraph, if their usage of copyrighted materials does not fall under fair use, then it is the responsibility of this governing body to make their legislation on this matter accordingly.
