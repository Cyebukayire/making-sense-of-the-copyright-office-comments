AI, as in the current spate of Language Learning Model (LLM) programs, has no author, therefore no AI (LLM) produced work can be copyrighted. It really is as simple as that. If a work is substantially produced by AI (LLM), no amount of human editing will negate the fact there is no author. Further, AI (LLM) is inherently plagiaristic and copyright violating by its nature, as it necessarily must be &#39;trained&#39; using existing written works and cannot properly attribute its sources or where it is stealing the material from.
