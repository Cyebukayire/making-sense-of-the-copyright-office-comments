AI works should not be able to be copyrighted. These modules learn from and take from previously made, human-made copyrighted works and as such can lead constitutes intellectual property theft. Allowing others&#39; artwork to be used and copyrighted, and therefor monetized, without the original artist&#39;s consent is harmful to the creative field and they deserve to be properly compensated. It is also worth noting that the ability to copyright AI works could result in corporations laying off mass amounts of artists and writers. Those in the creative field are already struggling and they do not deserve to have their livelihoods taken by these modules. It should also be said that copyright the likeness of an artist&#39;s style could lead to legal loopholes and thus pre-existing works having a monopoly over the creative field, not allowing other works to be made as everything in the creative field is inherently inspired by something. I urge you to not let these styles be copyrightable as it is far too vague and could lead to the erosion of the creative industry.
