I believe that works created through the sole use of generative AI should not be copyrightable. <br/><br/>By its&#39; nature, works created through the sole use of generative AI have largely been exploitative of creators&#39; labor. These kinds of works do not require any artistic merit, and can be used not only to leave creators out of a job, but to exploit people and companies seeking a creative work. The current most popular and widely available generative AI platforms have all been built and improved upon off creations scraped from the internet without the consent or knowledge of the creators. <br/><br/>AI is also used to steal the likeness and/or style of individual creators. A person can feed an AI data to train it on the creations a person or their likeness is based on, such as a collection of their art, photos/videos of their likeness, recordings of their voice, writing, etc., to impersonate or exploit the creator&#39;s work without the express consent of the person. These works are also constructed through the use of user prompts, meaning that the generative AI handles the process of creation. <br/><br/>Allowing people and companies to profit off of the theft of millions&#39; of creator&#39;s work is unethical and unfair to those who have put time and effort into their works. As such, I believe that works created through the sole use of generative AI should not be allowed to be copyrighted.
