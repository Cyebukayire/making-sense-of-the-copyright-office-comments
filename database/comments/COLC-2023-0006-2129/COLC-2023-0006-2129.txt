Hi,<br/><br/>How is AI generated art that much different from a camera photo? Photographs can be copyrighted, despite the fact all the artist had to do is press a button on a camera, and touch it up using in camera editing tools or image editing software. <br/><br/>&quot;In December 2014, the United States Copyright Office stated that works created by a non-human, such as a photograph taken by a monkey, are not copyrightable&quot;  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute <br/><br/>In the case of the Midjourney generated AI, it was a human, not a monkey, who performed the action of image generation. One can argue that there&#39;s more human intervention in shaping the AI images, because the human entered a text prompts. <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>
