I am a writer and an artist who creates fictional stories and drawings for fun. I also enjoy sharing them online because I can inspire others. However, I have become more reluctant about posting my works online since learning about AI.<br/>AI that can generate artwork has been capable of copying writings and pictures, and then using them to create its own works on the false claim that it&#39;s &quot;original.&quot; I am aware that this is mostly a lie. Some of those works are simply alterations of the original. I can&#39;t say it&#39;s happen to me, but I know based on what other creatives are saying on the internet.<br/>Since learning of this, I have been discouraged from posting my creations online, and it has even harmed my imaginative thought process as well. As someone who enjoys creating art, it mentally hurts me.<br/>I implore for the U.S. Copyright Office to prevent AI from getting copyright. If these computer programs get the right to be publish from thief and little humanity, then it destroys what I define creativity, and it will discourage others from sharing the joy of their works. Thank you for reading.
