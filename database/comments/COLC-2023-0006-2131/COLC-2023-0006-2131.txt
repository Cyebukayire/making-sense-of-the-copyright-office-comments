I cannot answer the questions given point by point, given the character limits, but I will try to state my broad concerns addressed in them:<br/><br/>1) Because AI is not sapient and cannot comprehend its input or output, none of its works can be said to be &quot;intellectual&quot; property. While the models are impressive and often put out results that are comprehensible to humans, the machine does not understand or care about what it has produced.<br/><br/>2) The humans running the machine did not produce the work, either, even if they did write the prompt; even if they carefully honed the prompt over time. I have commissioned human artists for artwork before; while I then own the right to use it for personal purposes, the copyright for that piece remains theirs unless I specifically buy it from them. The artist did the labor; I just laid out the specifics. *I* am not the artist of that piece; I am a client, even if I buy my way into being a copyright holder. It seems wildly unprecedented to me for a human to claim authorship of a commissioned piece, just because the &quot;artist&quot; was a machine instead of a human.<br/><br/>3) All major AI models have been trained on art and writing for which it did not receive authorial permission. AI does not cite its sources, and even the creators of the models cannot track where the machine did its learning, or precisely how it compiled its output. And since it is not actually intelligent, the AI cannot make decisions or be held accountable for what kind of things it learns, or who to credit for them. Until this is resolved, current models seem to me to be fundamentally unethical--the model consumes work it does not own, benefiting from the labor of creators who will never see a dime from the AI&#39;s profits.<br/><br/>4) There may, in the future, be an ethical way to produce AI-generated writing, as the models gain a more advanced command of the rules of English. Words have limited meanings, and no one person can copyright basic parts of speech. I believe this would only be limited to more technical writing--there are only so many ways, for instance, to describe how to operate a toaster. A dozen human writers working independently would all produce similar-sounding work, without plagiarizing at all. Perhaps AI can one day be considered equal to such a task. I do not think AI is there yet, with so many unresolved issues surrounding its sources.<br/><br/>5) I do not see any way that there will ever be ethically-produced AI-generated art--especially graphic and visual art, but also music, poetry, etc. While *words* are largely static and for use by all, *art* is innately personal to the artist. Their handwriting, their brushstrokes, the way they see and abstract and represent their observations; their conventions, their stylistic markers, etc. AI cannot innovate. It cannot imagine. It cannot experiment. It cannot interpret. It has no lived experience. It can only acquire, and systematize, and repurpose. AI generated art of all forms is innately derivative, with no way to make it otherwise. While all artists must take inspiration from others, AI cannot be inspired; it can merely copy. I cannot see a way it will ever *not* infringe upon human authorial rights; I cannot see a way it can ever produce any art that should be considered original or copyrightable.<br/><br/>6) I believe AI should be regulated to only harvest data from those who opt-in with specific permission. In other words, existing email, cloud storage, social media sites, etc., should not be allowed to simply insert a clause into their TOS to allow themselves to train their machines on their users. Such methods are easily missed by users, and it essentially holds them under duress to pressure their consent.<br/><br/>7) I believe AI should be regulated so that any services run by image or language generators should clearly and plainly disclose themselves as such. i.e., Tech support chat bots, automated tellers, etc. It is my belief that people should never be duped into thinking they are interacting with a human if they aren&#39;t.<br/><br/>8) I believe that, going forward, if there *are* AI-generated works that allow a human to hold copyright and financially benefit from them, that human *must* also be held accountable for what the AI creates. This includes plagiarism, illegal / incendiary output, being trained on non-permitted sources, etc. Humans should should not gain benefits from owning/using an AI to create *unless* they are liable for its output, as well.
