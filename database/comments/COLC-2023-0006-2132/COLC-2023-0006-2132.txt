I believe training AI using copyrighted material should involve the consent of the creator of said copyrighted material. This should be done before training and proper effort must be made to ensure that the creator is fully aware of the terms in giving their consent, such as the case of opt in and opt out systems. The creator should also have the right to dictate how their work will be used by developers and users of AI.
