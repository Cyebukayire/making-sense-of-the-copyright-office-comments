I don&#39;t think that copyright should be given to AI generated content as the initial material - writing and art - used to create the AI are stolen works. The writing and artwork fed into the various AI machines were used without permission of the creators. Allowing outright theft to be remixed and repackaged as original content and then copyrighted goes against our current system of copyright. If a human took twenty books, changed up the words, added a few of their own and submitted it for copyright it would be considered plagiarized. It shouldn&#39;t be allowed just because a machine does it on a larger scale. Thank you for taking the time to read this comment.
