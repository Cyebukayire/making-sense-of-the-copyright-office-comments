I am a 17-year-old artist. The rise and growth of AI-generated art makes me concerned for my future, especially since I want to be in the animation industry.  AI &quot;art&quot; is ripping and scalping off people&#39;s hard work. Art goes back generations and is a massive part of human history. If we were to take that away, what would be left? AI when used unethically strips humanity away from all of us. Art and creative pursuits bring us together as a community and AI art does the exact opposite. AI &quot;art&quot; is &quot;created&quot; (I use these terms very loosely because nothing is truly being CREATED) by scalping and searching the internet for source images. These images are used to train its program so it can create AI-generated &quot;art&quot;. Every single time these source images it is taking from are copyrighted and were drawn by human artists. Since this AI is stealing work from (human) artists, it is 100% copyright infringement. I&#39;m tired of this, we need change and regulation towards unethical AI. If not, we are in for a grim future.
