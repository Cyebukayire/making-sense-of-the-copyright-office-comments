I am the author of two copyrighted novels. They took me years to write, edit and publish. I am very concerned that those who are supporting this &quot;machine generated content&quot; will use my novels and their content for &quot;training.&quot; This is stealing my work and co-opting it for AI use without compensation or acknowledgement of the work&#39;s origins. I do not support allowing machine generated (AI) content to be copyrighted. Machines cannot create original content. They can only absorb and regurgitate content created by humans. Only content created by actual humans should be eligible for copyright protections.
