AI art is a threat to the future of thousands. If we don&#39;t have regulated copyright systems, we are breaking the rights to these people. AI prompters plagiarize over other people&#39;s work without their consent and profit from it. This is copyright infringement, plain and simple. As a government you have the responsibility to protect the individuals of which lives are dependent that the creative workflow of visual arts is stable. If we don&#39;t, these people will lose their jobs.
