For generative AI, I think it&#39;s important to acknowledge that the prompt that generates a result is very clearly a copyrightable portion, and in particular, then, considering that the result cannot occur without the prompt and the conscious generation and subsequent use, any resulting artifact must be at least partially legally the copyright of the person who so prompted/generated and used.  However, in our era, copyright must be about more than mere financial recompense but also attribution.  In this light, I would argue there is a special sort of status here requiring that the AI employed be attributed, but no greater copyright be given beyond the human who directed and used the result.  As there is the remote possibilities of emergent consciousness, such a special acknowledgment would not overly engineer for a future we cannot know, but at least prepare an essential ingredient for this most esoteric of concern along with all the more practical ones.  Along these lines, if/where we somehow allow generative AI to create entirely on its own, such material then would not be &quot;copyrighted&quot;/copyrightable, but would have to be so attributed.  As to the companies that are possessing the engine itself, I would argue that they can, if they require and enter into agreement with users, be partial copyright holders, but as this is a kind of infrastructure this must be a limited kind of right and must be carefully reassessed as we gain more experience.<br/><br/>Please note my comments are especially, but not only, from an artistic interest/stake.
