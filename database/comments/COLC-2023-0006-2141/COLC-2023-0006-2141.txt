AI operators are making, publishing, and releasing foraging guides. These will get people killed with false guidance about what plants and mushrooms are safe to eat. These books are being released under the names of legitimate authors without consent or even knowledge of the authors names being used. So not only are people going to poison themselves but legitimate researchers will be blamed because their names are on the books. None of this should be legal.
