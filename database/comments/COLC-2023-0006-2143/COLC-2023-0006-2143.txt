Please regulate in favor of real people. While AI has some great potentials, allowing it to hold or violate copyright freely allows the big wigs (for lack of a better term) to produce content without crediting original creators, without hiring them/paying fair wages, cutting people out of residual rights, and the list goes on. <br/>Our politicians like to talk about the importance of jobs in this country, but failing to define regulations against AI and protecting creators will reduce jobs.
