Thank you for taking public consultation. I am an prospective writer. I am not a US citizen, but as the US Copyright Office helps sets standards globally, I hope you will understand that I feel I have a vested interest. I am concerned that allowing copyrighted works to be used for training AI will devalue copyrights and will make it worthless to produce a copyrighted work. I don&rsquo;t want to write if my writing will just be used to produce a thousand empty, soulless copies. Thank you for reading my words.
