AI image generators is what I have the most experience with; unlike in a regular search engine, an AI image generator removes the owner of art, and combines pre-existing art with other pre-existing art - always without crediting its original creators. The end result is a collage that lacks imagination, originality, and any kind of creative skills. It is stealing labour from artists, who already struggle to be paid fairly in a capitalist system that devalues the existence and significance of arrt, whilst still constantly using it, and taking advantage of its creators. The lack of protection that regular artists struggle with is only going to get worse the more pervasive generative AIs become, and without regulation, it will be impossible to have ownership over work you have created.
