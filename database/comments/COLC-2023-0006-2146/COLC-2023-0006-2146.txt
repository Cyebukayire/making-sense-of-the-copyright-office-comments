I do not want AI to write books. I want people to write books. I do not want articles in journals written by AI. I want people to write for journals, magazines and newspapers. Keep AI out of books writing, all publishing and away from us writers. AI is not a sentient being. It cannot make me laugh, cry or hope. Only a human being is capable of that. Please say no to AI.
