I personally think that the act of creating Ai creative work should be terminated completely, however the act of monetizing said work for commercial benefit should not be allowed. Many artists have had their work stolen and used to create Ai artwork and have had their art been used to train Ai programs without proper permission to do so. Ai artwork has the possibility to rid artists of their jobs and we&rsquo;ve already seen examples of company&rsquo;s use Ai artwork as promotional material (ex. See Cytus 2 &amp; Netflix)
