AI, due to the fact that it utilizes free resources and is known to scrape data from millions of other sources on the internet without permission at times, should be considered free of copyright because it itself violates copyright often. Writings, visual images, and many mediums across the internet are mined by AI to generate text as well as images and some of these are copyrighted sources that AI ignores. As a result, it should not be legal for AI-made items to be copyrighted and given the same protections while it still conducts this kind of unrestricted datamining. Selling these for profit is about the same as printing an image from Google and demanding payment for it. It is comparable to secondhand theft.
