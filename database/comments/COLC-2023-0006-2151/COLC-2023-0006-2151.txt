The use of an input prompt with AI, by a human, in my view makes AI a tool akin to a pen. The resulting content is the work of a human who very much shapes the resulting content by the competence and sophistication of that human&#39;s ability to create a prompt input that directs the results. Currently, that human can also choose to ask Google questions and then use the results in their copyrightable works. Perhaps it should be a requirement to show the origin with an AI symbol or notice. Perhaps it should be required to show non-presentation related input prompts, not things like &#39;write for a 5th grade audience&#39; but things having to do with the substance of the requested topic.<br/>Unless the AI is totally autonomous in its creation of text or imagery, then it is being used as a tool by a human, a content creation tool for a human content creator. <br/>Because of the above, I believe there should be copyright protection available for works created as I describe above, i.e. human inputted requests of AI.
