AI cannot and and should not be copyrighted. Because the content generated by AI is an amalgamation of work produced by humans the copyright lies with the original creator. Furthermore, because unique items cannot be reproduced by the same tool there is no content to protect. I&rsquo;d you feed the same prompt to an image generator multiple times you will get different results every time. Therefore the content is not uniquely that of a specific creator.
