I really do not think that AI generated works should be eligible for copyright protection. There&rsquo;s a lot of people investing in AI as a way to make a quick buck by exploiting artists and writers through quick AI publications before legislation can catch up. There&rsquo;s already several AI cookbooks and guides to edible plants that give hazardous advice. If the draw of a quick profit were eliminated then those who legitimately care about improving artificial intelligence for the benefit of science would be able to work in peace
