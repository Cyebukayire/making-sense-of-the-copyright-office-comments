It should be possible to use copyrighted material in training AI models, but only if the creator opts in. Furthermore, the fact that they are opting in by using a particular service should be clearly and conspicuously labeled. Ideally, a copy of each item used to train the AI should be retained for at least five years, but if this is not feasible, a detailed description of the work and creator, including title; author&rsquo;s name; upload date; type of material (art or written); and a short description or summary should be maintained for at least five years. A written request should be sufficient to allow a copyright holder to know if their work is being used to train AI, and to remove it if desired.<br/><br/>No form of AI-created work should be considered human-authored, and use of AI to create materials without attribution should be considered plagiarism. It should not be possible to profit off AI-created material.<br/><br/>Liability for copyright infringement should be apportioned 25% to the developers of the device, and 75% to the user who created the infringing work. A copyright holder should be able to collect liability from both the developers and the user.<br/><br/>Human likenesses should only be allowed to be used in AI with express consent, and AI-created materials should not be attributed to a particular author (i.e., if someone uses AI to write a work in a series, it should not be credited to the author of that series, and if it is, a notarized affidavit with a current federally-issued ID from the creator should be sufficient proof for a takedown.<br/>
