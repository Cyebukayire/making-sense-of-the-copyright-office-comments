I believe AI should not have copyright protection. Due to its nature of using anything it can find in the internet with no regard of what is free to use and without any sort of credit to the artists it uses I feel it is unfair to artists of all professions for AI work to be protected under such laws. Personally, I liken AI art to a student writing an essay, but rather than stating their own thoughts on the subject, they copy and paste snippets of other essays and change a few words via a thesaurus. While yes, it did create a new piece of work, and yes it may be high quality, it was created under questionable circumstances and hence, said student does not receive a grade. On another note, AI art is not made by a human who needs to earn an income in order to survive. Artists, however, are essential to the economy. While yes, using AI is cheaper for studios to produce, it hinders the flow of money and puts thousands of people out of work. I am so proud to live in a country in which anyone can make it big if they put their heart and soul into what they are passionate about. However, I fear that automating so many jobs will put our country on a downhill slope, forcing people to choose between a set number of jobs. By keeping AI art copyright free, we can retain our ability to chase our dreams. I trust you, our government leader, will make the best choice and protect our country&#39;s artists. I sincerely thank you for listening to my option on the matter, and I beg you to protect everyone&#39;s right to create.
