I think that in the current political and social climate, further development and use of AI, in any way more than we do now, would be disastrous.<br/><br/>I can envision a world where 75% of the labor is done by AI and robotics but the people who would no longer have to do those jobs wouldn&#39;t have to worry about where their next meal would be coming from OR if they were going to lose their house because they no longer had a job. However currently, all that would end up happening is the jobs would get replaced by basically free labor in the form of robotics and AI, the executives would keep all of the savings and probably jack up the price, and the rest of the world would never see a singular cent of those savings. We&#39;ve seen similar things happening currently with companies having record profits but the lowest paid employee still has to make the choice between eating and keeping a roof over their head.<br/><br/>AI, as it is currently, will be the worst it will ever be from this moment onward. As AI gets better, it will consistently be trained to do the work of creatives by stealing the work from said hard-working creatives in order to improve it&#39;s algorithms. It is already happening right now with some of the bigger AI generated art applications and websites pulling from websites such as DeviantArt. <br/><br/>The solution isn&#39;t to copyright every piece of Art ever created. There aren&#39;t enough hours in the day and there isn&#39;t enough manpower to do so. If you want to train AI to do something like write TV scripts, pay TV writers to create stories to train it and pay them residuals on everything that AI creates from the moment they are hired.<br/><br/>We don&#39;t need reactionary legislation to a problem we aren&#39;t having yet, as that will be too late when it starts becoming a problem. Instead, we need a proactive thought into what the problem down the line is going to look like, even if that problem is going to be difficult to solve. Most of the crises we are currently facing as a nation stem from the lack of thought or malicious greed of past generations, do not let AI turn into the next generation&#39;s crisis.
