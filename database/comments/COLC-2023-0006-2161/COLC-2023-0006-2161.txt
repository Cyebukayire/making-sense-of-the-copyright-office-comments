The utilization of Artificial Intelligence does not belong in Arts Industries in which passionate people spend their souls into their respective crafts whether writing, painting, or voice acting. AI threatens to absolutely destroy these industries only leaving room at the top for veterans. The arts should be approachable by anyone but with soulless AI on the rise alongside even worse companies, newcomers will be shut out and discouraged to chase their dreams in fear of being replaced. Not to mention the legality of stealing the work of already exisitng artists and then replicating cheap mockeries. And because they&#39;re cheap, they will lead to downfall. Misinformation will further be on the rise. Imagine the faces and now voices of political figures being impersonated. Men and women who may not be as savy will follow manipulation. Our country&#39;s arts aren&#39;t just in danger, but our future entirely. AI must be regulated with an iron fist if not preferably, banned outright.
