For several years I have run an online shop where I sold adult coloring books with my original art. Each book was the result of hundreds of hours worth of work and sold for 8-10 dollars. My shop has been a popular and thriving one, and generated a helpful side income for over five years. <br/><br/>In the past year, non-artists using various AI platforms to generate hundreds of images in a matter of minutes have flooded the market with books of their &ldquo;art&rdquo;, collections of 100 or more images costing less than a dollar. Much of the images were clearly requested &ldquo;in the style of&rdquo; various known and popular artists in the adult coloring market, in what is very obviously a deliberate attempt to capitalize on their talent and use their images as the &ldquo;training&rdquo; material for the AI. <br/><br/>Unable to compete with this, my sales have dwindled to almost nothing. It has caused financial hardship to my family, not to mention the anger and anxiety evoked by seeing these very AI-generated images plastered with copyright watermarks, as though their sellers had anything to do with their creation beyond typing keywords into a chat box. I have spoken with other artists within the genre and their experience has been the same. This technology is not progress. It is a devastating blow and arguably a violation of the intellectual property rights of millions of people who have been able to eke out a living with their creative skills&mdash;never an easy task, and now almost impossible. <br/><br/>I am attaching an example of this phenomenon. Please note these are not my drawings&mdash;they are the work of a very well-known illustrator placed side by side with the AI-generated work being sold by her competitors. They serve as examples for precisely how blatantly AI represents the theft of artistic copyright for the personal gain of these charlatans. It is outrageous and Congress MUST act to protect independent creators.
