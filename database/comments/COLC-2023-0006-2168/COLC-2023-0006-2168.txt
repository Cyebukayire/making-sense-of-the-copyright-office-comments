AI is weird and confusing and I don&#39;t know what to fully make of it.<br/><br/>It is inevitable that it will be used as a tool for artists, but its use could also be used, unscrupulously, by hucksters trying to make a quick buck. As an artist, I think a lot of us in creative fields feel threatened by it, but I think if handled correctly, perhaps we&#39;d be able to co-exist <br/><br/>I think AI as used as part of a mixed medium piece should be eligible for copyright, but I am hesitant to extend the same to works made entirely with AI. Creative works should have an artist&#39;s hand. If collage and mash-up songs are art (which I fully believe they are), then AI, which uses pre-existing work to train its algorithm, is not that much different on its face, though the automation of it robs these works of personal touches that would make these unique to artists. <br/><br/>AI work should be always be disclosed as being AI. As AI improves, a lot of people will use it to scam customers out of money; I&#39;ve already seen this happen. Perhaps if there were some kind of watermark for these purely AI works made by individuals using it, it could be used more for personal projects or demonstration, rather than commercially sold and copyrighted. There should be a threshold for how much of a work is made with AI versus how much is crafted by a human, though I don&#39;t exactly know how much that would be. For projects that would involve both audio and visual elements, and perhaps even interactive ones, I think so long as at least one of elements is fully made by a human and the use of AI is disclosed openly, it should be eligible for copyright, or at least be worth consideration. It&#39;s worth keeping in mind that AI may be used by artists who lack the resources to hire those who might be able to make something purely on their own, and would not be able to financially compensate other artists to collaborate. Artists themselves like to experiment with AI just to test its capabilities, creating work to use as a framework upon with AI can be applied.<br/><br/>What I am absolutely against is the idea of large corporations and studios using AI as a replacement for artists, writers, musicians and voice actors. This is something that they&#39;re threatening to do with the multiple strikes across many creative industries happening right now. I do not think that these massive media conglomerates should just be able to get away with not only not meeting the very basic demands of the people that make the things that they&#39;re selling, but they should also not be rewarded for replacing that labor with work of AI. I don&#39;t know how this would be legally enforceable, however.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things worth considering here. There is no putting the genie back in the bottle. We cannot undo AI. The best we can do is try and make sure its use is as ethical and transparent as possible, and that we, collectively, should view it as but another tool in our creative toolboxes, rather than a replacement for human labor.
