The purpose of generative AI is to produce output *indistinguishable* from its training data, therefore I believe it is almost inherently a violation of fair use, and any training of AI should be evaluated critically for copyright infringement. <br/><br/>In addition, since generative AI and their outputs are completely deterministic and predictable, I do not believe their outputs can be classified as &quot;creative&quot;, making them ineligible to be copyrighted. A human analogue would be a financial ledger; anyone attempting to copyright their inventory spreadsheets would rightfully be laughed out of the office.
