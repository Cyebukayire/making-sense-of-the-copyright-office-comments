To whom it may concern: <br/><br/>On the copyrighting of AI generated works: if &quot;the author or authors of the work&quot; are those which have ownership of copyright (US Code 17 S. 201), then it seems that the AI itself would have copyright ownership rather than the designers of the AI, as it was the AI which did the creation and derivation process to transmute existing works. As AI are not natural persons (at least at present, as no AI is considered to be sentient), one would assume this would follow the same trajectory as the &quot;Monkey selfie copyright dispute&quot;--the creator is not an entity who can be assigned legal rights. If AI were considered persons, then it seems as if this should come with some sort of labor arrangement (i.e. &quot;work made for hire&quot;) and/or other form of rights, as well as being held legally responsible for any copyright violations they do commit. Additionally, it is not clear that one could (or should be able to) copyright another person&#39;s, well, essential self, and so AIs declared persons would presumably fall immediately out of copyright, or would require new systems in order to exist under copyright law; perhaps something similar to signing away one&#39;s likeness, although the details seem rather difficult. <br/><br/>On the usage of copyrighted photos for AI training: it would, in fact, be a burden for AI trainers to only use open-source or personal artwork or photography without accidentally finding misleadingly posted artwork outside of copyright, etc. However, the existing state where those training AI use the work of others is also a burden; it takes advantage of the skills and labor of artists without recompensing them appropriately, burdening them with lack of appropriate recompense for goods and services rendered. Additionally, on the subject of imitation, let us suppose the existence of a copyright holder, Jane Q. Public, and the existence of her copyrighted photographs. An AI and a human artist might be asked to generate an image in the style of Jane Q. Public, and do so, and style is not a copyrightable aspect. Existing copyright precedent suggests that the human artist is protected if there are significant differences between the existing work of Jane Q. Public and the new work or if the works are similar by happenstance (not accurate in this thought experiment); only willful intent to create a imitation of Jane Q. Public&#39;s work without derivative alteration or commentary would be a violation. It seems that AI should be held to the same standard, although the guilt would fall on the requesting individual rather than the AI. The copyright being enforced on material used to train AI is fundamentally to recompense labor; the copyright enforced on the product of AI if willfully generated to imitate another is a matter of copyright protection for artistic creations.<br/><br/>On the usage of AI for modifying one&#39;s own material: while this should be disclosed (along with other parts of process requisite for copyright), this seems fundamentally unremarkable, closer to an artistic aid than anything else. One might consider possibilities in which an artist trains an AI in their own style and uses it as an artistic aid, perhaps after disability or injury, or, alternatively, an artist trains an AI as part of their artistic process in order to generate some effect. That being said, using Adobe Photoshop to commit a copyright infringement does not mean that the consequences fall on Adobe Photoshop, so the usage of AI would have to be monitored for possible infringement of copyright, the responsibility for which would fall on the artist themselves. It is for this additional reason that copyright should be enforced at the inlet--i.e. when training AI to begin with, in order that ideas of &quot;willful&quot; do not become further removed and complex.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading.
