I believe that AI art should not be copyrightable because there is no human element. Art is defined by Oxford languages as &quot;the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power&quot;<br/>Going on this, since there is hardly any human control involved in AI art, I do not believe it should be copyrightable.
