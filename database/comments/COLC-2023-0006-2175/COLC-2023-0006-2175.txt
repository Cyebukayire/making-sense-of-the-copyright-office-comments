AI such as ChatGPT are built upon scraped data taken without the consent of the data&#39;s holders. There&#39;s a word for this: it&#39;s called stealing. <br/>Unless an AI&#39;s developers receive explicit permission from every individual they are scraping data from, they should not be allowed to even monetize their AI, much less have the &quot;content&quot; it produces be copyrightable.<br/>Refuse to give these selfish &quot;AI bros&quot; even the time of day until they create an ETHICALLY SOURCED AI that grants credit and compensation to those who&#39;s work it is being built on. This isn&#39;t up for debate.
