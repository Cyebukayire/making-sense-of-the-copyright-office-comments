As a working artist - a costume creator in the film industry - A.I. poses a distinct threat to the careers of myself and others like me who have fought so long and hard to get where we are. Professional creatives have to fight tooth and nail just to get paid somewhat decently (sometimes not even a true living wage) for our valuable work, and A.I. is posed to take so much of that away. In my particular case, if the large Hollywood studios have their way you are going to see thousands upon thousands of people permanently out of work, all so these mega corporations can save a few bucks and create movies and shows with no heart or human creative process behind them. <br/><br/>These utilizations of A.I. are a very real threat to the existence of so many who already struggle to receive any respect at all. It&rsquo;s dismal and needs immediate addressing.
