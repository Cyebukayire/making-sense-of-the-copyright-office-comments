Content created through the use of &quot;AI&quot; generation, whether it is text, images, sound, or anything else should not be able to be copyrighted . <br/>I do not think large firms should be able to use AI generation systems to create intellectual property without needing to hire and pay writers, artists, musicians, and actors. <br/>The fact that content produced by these programs was not created by any one person means it cannot be attributed to a person as copyrightable content.
