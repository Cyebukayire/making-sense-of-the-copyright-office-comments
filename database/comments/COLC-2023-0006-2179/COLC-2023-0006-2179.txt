Companies/organizations/individuals should not be able to copyright art, media, or other content generated by AI due to there being no human directly responsible for the creation. The ability of those not responsible for the creation of art should not be able to profit off of it as that would result in artists and content creators losing their jobs and the quality of creative works will significantly decrease. Human culture as a whole could be impacted negatively if human creation is left unvalued and unprotected in this way.
