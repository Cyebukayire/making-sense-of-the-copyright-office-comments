Generative AI or Large Language Models, however it&#39;ll be called by marketing, is a piece of technology that by its very nature infringes upon copyrighted work in all its facets as we understand it today in the law. Not only does it steal revenue from original creators, it has been shown to degenerate in accelerated rates once it has it&#39;s own stolen library of content to work off of, as it increasingly introduces more and more errors as time goes on without ever correcting itself, as it&#39;s incapable to do so. To think this &quot;AI&quot; generates value is an offense to anyone that has put in work and effort into being an actual productive member of society and its arts, visual or written, and it represents cannibalistic capitalism at it&#39;s worst.<br/><br/>We need regulations for it ASAP.
