I&#39;m an illustrator and animator, two artistic professions which have the potential to be revolutionized or decimated by AI, depending on how certain legal aspects. I believe the following:<br/>1. in order for AI to respect copyright, they must be trained using only data which the entity training the AI has legal right to, either from the public domain, it being already the property of the entity or via purchase/contracted use of those rights. Fair use alone is limited in dictating the creation of AI training datasets, as it is the final product which is judged by fair use, and currently training datasets which use artists work without permission result in AI systems which can replicate the artist&#39;s work down to the signature and watermark itself, and due to them not having the permission of the artist, this is a violation of the artist&#39;s rights and intellectual property, just as a bootleg forgery of their art would be. <br/>2. Works which are solely the creation of an AI should not be liable for copyright themselves, as copyright extends its protection solely to humans, and without human invention an AI created work is similar to an artwork created by an animal, such as in the case of Naruto v. David Slater et al.<br/><br/>AI created art can prove a beneficial tool for the arts and artists and people generally, but the legal structures we have to protect the rights of artists and intellectuals in the US against mass bootlegging/violation of intellectual property law should also protect those rights in this case.
