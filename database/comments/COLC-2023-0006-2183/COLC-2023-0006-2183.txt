Seriously concerned by the potential of AI to ruin humans creativity. I worry if we allow art created by a machine via human prompts to be granted copyright protection then it will potentially leave no where left for artists, writers ,musicians etc especially younger artists starting In an industry. You could potentially have billions of people creating new artwork every second. If every piece is covered by copyright where does that leave humans. The same can be said of music as with computer power every sequence of notes possible could potentially be created and copyrighted which leaves nothing left for humans to create. There just has to be human involvement. I also feel the use of copying artists specific style or voice is an infringement, especially if the artists in question have had work used without permission. Work created by ai should not be copyrightable and companies should only be able to train their machines using work that is either in the public domain and free to use or with permission and probably paid royalties to original creator, at the very least artists should be able to opt out of having their work copied and used or have work removed from training datesets. If this includes companies having to restart training again then so be it, it is their fault for using others hard work without seeking permission first. Even where a human has a lot of involvement in for example the new Photoshop add ons, the bits that ai do input with prompts cannot possibly be copyrightable. I think it should just be simple. AI work can not be copyrightable, only the elements that are purely human can be. If AI work is ever able to be copyrighted I see the end of human creation which would be of huge detriment to the world.
