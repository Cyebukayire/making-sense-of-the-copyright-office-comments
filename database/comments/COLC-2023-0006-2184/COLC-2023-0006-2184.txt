I do not feel that AI generated content should be able to receive a copyright. As established by the legal case regarding the monkey selfie where PeTA sued the photographer, in order to receive copyright art must be generated by a human. AI is not human and does not use any creativity of its own, but rather violates the copyright of previous artists by taking their work and claiming the output as original. <br/><br/>Humans, when inspired by previous work, always have a level of creativity and interpretation that make the piece original. AI is not capable of independent creative output. It is theft disguised as art. <br/><br/>Please continue the established legal course of requiring human creation for granting copyright.
