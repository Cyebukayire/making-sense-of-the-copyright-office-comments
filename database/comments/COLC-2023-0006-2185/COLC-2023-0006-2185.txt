Those who use artificial intelligence shouldn&#39;t be used in general. Many AI use sources, images, and sounds in which they did not get permission to use them for. They are being used to impersonate voices and make them say things they haven&#39;t said. Create images of people who never consented (nude images, etc). I believe there should be strict laws on AI usuage to ensure the safety and privacy of our citizens. Thank you :)
