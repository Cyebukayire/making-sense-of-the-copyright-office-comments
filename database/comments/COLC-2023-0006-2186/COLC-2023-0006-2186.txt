Hi there, as a creative I strongly object to any use of my works to train generate AI. I also strongly object to generative AI works holding copyright, as this can become a messy legal process. I hope that for the sake of my, and fellow creatives livelihoods that AI should remain under copyright able and unmonetizable. I hope that it will stay solely as a public good.
