With the rapid growth of using AI to replace creative works, I fear know that soon enough many writers will be replaced by AI. Thus taking jobs of many. An even bigger problem is that the AI itself needs to be trained, and in that training they use pre-existing works, often without the creator(s) consent. And I find it ironic that Hollywood studios are open to using AI to replace their actors and writers, when they were very aggressive in their anti-piracy campaign in the early 2000s.
