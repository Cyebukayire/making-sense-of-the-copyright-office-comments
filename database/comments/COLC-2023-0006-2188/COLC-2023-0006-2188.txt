I believe that using copyrighted material to train AI does NOT fall under free use, and that doing so should be considered illegal. <br/><br/>That being said, material generated using AI should not be eligible to be copyrighted. Just as art created by animals cannot be copyrighted, material generated by AI should be void of copyright as both animal art and AI-generated materials contain around the same amount of human intervention. <br/><br/>Liability should fall on the developer of the AI system. It is the developer who allowed the user to create infringing material, and it is the developer who should be held responsible for their irresponsibility.<br/><br/>These are my positions. Thank you for your time reading and reviewing this comment :)
