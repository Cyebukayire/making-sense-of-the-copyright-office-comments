As a writer who has posted writing online and have not given permission for AI companies to use my work for training AI or for content, I am concerned about plagiarism. I read a list of websites ChatGPT used to train their AI system and one of the sites, Archive of Our Own, is one that I have many works posted on. When a user posts a work on the database they retain their ownership of the work and do not give express permission for AI models to use their work. I have set my works as private, meaning that a reader has to have a login to read, due to concerns about AI and privacy. The following points are ones that I, and many other writers, feel need to be addressed: <br/><br/>1. Using copyrighted materials in training AI models, specifically, whether permission from copyright owner is needed, in what form (opt in or opt out), and if compensations is necessary; what type of system for permission and remuneration is feasible, whether records should be retained to identify training materials used, and if they should be available to copyright holders; if requests are not honored, what remedies should be available.<br/><br/>2. Whether materials generated using AI systems are copyrightable &ndash; namely what level of human involvement may be considered sufficient control over the output material for it to be considered human-authored.<br/><br/>3. Potential liability for infringing works generated with the use of AI systems: how the liability should be apportioned between the developers of the system and the user who provided the prompts.<br/><br/>These suggestions were provided by the Organization for Transformative Works, a nonprofit who runs the website Archive of Our Own. <br/><br/>AI can be a powerful tool, but it can also be harmful, especially to artists. There needs to be guidelines and legislation in order to protect the intellectual property of creators.
