I&rsquo;m contacting you as a concerned citizen and a creative regarding the proliferation of AI generative technology that is currently happening within the arts and entertainment industry. This technology is already having a negative impact on creatives across the board; it has scrapped many artist&rsquo;s works into its datasets without permission or consent from the creators and copyright holders.<br/>The effect of this technology if left unregulated could be devastating to creatives in all industries and we are already seeing the ripple effect it&rsquo;s just starting to create-- further down the road it will start impacting other industries as well. From ChatGPT to Stability AI, these companies have a vested interest in getting away with stealing other people&rsquo;s work and profiting without credit or compensation. Currently many of these companies have opt-out only policies but, opt-out as opposed to opt-in puts the onus on the artists, who may not even realize that their work is being compiled into datasets, to opt-out of their data collection.<br/>Copyright reliant creative industries, such as the entertainment industry, contribute 1.8 trillion to the US GDP with an industry that employs 9.6 million workers. <br/><br/>The outcome of this seems clear: thousands of jobs are lost for workers in all creative industries and the rich get richer furthering the divide.

See- current situation with the writers and actors&rsquo; strike.<br/>Many experts have been discussing the ways in which going forward we can and should hold these companies accountable. Here are some of those proposals:<br/>1. Make sure any work being used is with permission, credit, and compensation.<br/>2. Allow for opt-in models only so artists work isn&rsquo;t taken and put into datasets without their knowledge. Make sure explicit consent is granted in an obvious way.<br/>3. Transparency when building the datasets.<br/>4. AI works clearly labeled as such.<br/>Art theft has always been a problem within the artistic community, but we&rsquo;ve never seen an entity on such a scale that will put this many people out of work in competition with their own work.<br/>Machine learning seems to be quickly becoming machine stealing, let&rsquo;s change that.<br/>Here are some valuable resources to learn more:<br/>https://www.createdontscrape.com/<br/>https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/<br/>https://www.egair.eu/#manifesto<br/>Artist testimonials:<br/>https://www.conceptartassociation.com/advocacy
