I want there to be more legislature governing ethical use of AI. It is wrong for AI for gather and &quot;learn&quot; from copyrighted material without permission. It&#39;s also unethical to allow AI to &quot;borrow&quot; from uncopyrighted material, as there&#39;s not enough differentiation from it learning and copying currently. Laws need to be updated to match the world we live in and allow for works to be protected from AI &quot;learning&quot;.
