Thank you for opening such an important issue up for public comment. I am a writer and editor and my financial security entirely depends on that work. I also strongly believe that it is immensely important for a democratic society to foster an environment in which art, expression, and literature can thrive. The Copyright Act specifies a window in which an author has exclusive rights to their work.&nbsp;This allows the author to recoup the effort expended in the creative process.&nbsp;Allowing AI to utilize new work by living authors will do damage to a creator&#39;s ability to make a living and therefore their ability to create at all. It would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive copyright to their works. Training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors should be found to violate the Copyright Act.
