Artists spend years developing their skills and creativity, and each piece they create is born of a lifetime of experience, decades of honing their craft, and an enormous number of hours spent sketching, drawing, rendering, and finishing the individual piece. By contrast, AI is an extremely complicated prediction model, simply calculating what arrangements of pixels a human will recognize as any given object. There is no intelligence involved. Moreover, AI cannot be trained except by the works of human artists who spend days or weeks on each piece, relying on years or decades of experience, often as their primary occupation. The owners of AI programs have thus far built their programs off the labor of artists whom they have not compensated.<br/>Is this copyright infringement? It should be.<br/><br/>Do AI &quot;artists&quot; (i.e. humans who provide prompts to AIs to generate images) create copyrightable works? Well, they don&#39;t really create anything since they&#39;re just playing a guessing game with a complicated prediction-maker. And everything in that prediction-maker stems from the work of people other than the AI &quot;artist&quot;. So they didn&#39;t create anything, and anything they did create was drawn from the labor of other people. So, no.<br/><br/>Can AI be credited with creating artistic works? No, it is, as all computers are, a really big math problem, built into complexity out of answers to yes/no questions. If AI is capable of creating copyrightable works, then why not other kinds of predictive software, like the models used to create weather forecasts or predict earthquakes?<br/><br/>I don&#39;t know enough about copyright law to saw how liability should be applied, but I believe it should weigh heavily in human artists&#39; favor. They are the ones who create the raw materials that AI is trained on, and they are the ones who suffer most greatly if their copyrights are infringed upon.<br/><br/>Similarly I don&#39;t know enough about existing laws to comment on AI mimicking voices/styles of existing artists, but again, things should weigh in favor of the artists. Artists in every field already contend with copycats, IP theft, and so forth. Users of AI-generation should not be allowed to skirt intellectual property laws, etc. simply because they are using novel technology.
