Hello,<br/>I&#39;m a working individual in the creative arts industry. I work in both 2D and 3D media, and have done so both as a contract freelance artist and a full time employee. I&#39;ve searched for my own work on websites designed to identify whether your work has been used in the most popular databases sourced by Generative AI industries, and I was able to find multiple instances of my work contained within. I was not asked for permission or compensated for this for-profit use of my copyrighted property. <br/>Databases that many AI companies use, like the LAION dataset, contain unsolicited work from millions of working creatives like myself, as well as all kinds of assorted data from random citizens around the world. Our work as artists, writers, photographers, etc has been taken without our knowledge for for-profit purposes, and then used to create a generative product that produces counterfeits and forgeries that compete against us in our own marketplaces.<br/><br/>AI systems undermine the value of human creative thinking and work, and harbor a danger for us creative people that should not be underestimated. There is a risk of a transfer of economic advantage to a few large AI companies, to the detriment of hundreds of thousands of creatives. It is the creative people with their works who create the data and marketing basis for the AI companies, from which the AI systems feed.<br/><br/>AI systems cannot produce text, images or music without suitable training material, and the quality of that training material has a direct influence on the quality of the results. In order to supply the systems with the necessary data, the developers of those AI systems are currently using the works of creative people - without consent or even asking, and without remuneration. In addition, creative professionals are denied a financial participation in the exploitation of the AI results created on the basis of their material.<br/><br/>My demand as a creative professional is this: The works and achievements of creative professionals must also be protected in digital space. Because something can be seen online, does not mean it&#39;s free for the taking. The technical possibility of being able to read works via text and data mining must not legitimize any unlicensed use!<br/><br/>The remuneration for the use of works is the economic basis on which creative people work. AI companies are clearly pursuing economic interests with their operation. The associated use of the work for commercial purposes must be properly licensed, and compensated appropriately. These companies should not be permitted to skirt by the rules that all other businesses have so far had to abide by when working with their employees or freelance contractors. If AI providers desire to use our work in their for-profit products and subscriptions, the work must first be licensed and approved by the creator and owner of the work.<br/><br/>We need transparent training data as an access requirement for AI providers. <br/>In order to obtain market approval, AI providers must be able to transparently present proof of this permission from the authors. The burden of proof and documentation of the data used - in the sense of applicable copyright law - lies with the AI provider. AI systems should only be trained from comprehensible, copyright-compliant sources. Simple as that. <br/><br/>Thank you
