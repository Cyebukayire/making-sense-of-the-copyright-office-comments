AI art and text violates copyright of artists and it looks terrible. It is dependent on training data and prone to &quot;overfitting&quot; if new data is not provided. It also requires enough water to cool a nuclear reactor in order to train. Use of AI should be restricted to scientific pursuits (e.g. image analysis for tumor detection and simulations). AI image creation is also responsible for &quot;deepfakes&quot; which could be used to frame individuals for crimes they didn&#39;t commit as well as violate bodily autonomy (deepfake nudes).
