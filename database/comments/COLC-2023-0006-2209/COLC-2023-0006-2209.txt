Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment.<br/>I am an author/artist whose living depends on my being able to monetize my work.<br/>Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution.<br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.<br/>
