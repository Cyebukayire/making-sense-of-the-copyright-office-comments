I have studied and received my degree in computer science with a concentration big data and cloud computing. I can say with confidence that the methods used to train AI to generate its output are wholesale stealing from real creators and people. An ai model can only replicate what it is given and cannot learn anything or extrapolate anything beyond that. It requires vast swaths of data in their training sets that MUST all come from real human input. It&#39;s unfeasible to create the amount of data required by oneself, thus it is necessary to source data from the internet.<br/><br/>We have already seen hobbyists and career creators in art, videos, voice acting etc have their content lifted for AI training without their knowledge or express permission in order to train AI to replicate those styles, voices etc wholesale without credit or royalties to the creators upon whose work the AI is basing its output on.<br/><br/>Beyond this, political figures are having their faces and voices mimicked with high accuracy in a true to life way in order to spread misinformation among people on both sides of the spectrum, as well as international leaders having their likeness faked. Photographs that look barely distinguishable from real life are being generated to create false narratives and outright lies.<br/><br/>AI is not just disastrous to the creative industry but is an active threat to national security and could even end up being a threat to international relations if the populice become misinformed due to falsified videos of real life leaders. Hard and strong regulation on AI in all aspects is a bipartisan necessity as soon as possible. I cannot state this with enough undue emphasis. AI models are gaining more data every date by the tetrabytes with which to make its falsified videos, voices, art etc more accurate and less distinguishable from real sources. The time to act is now.
