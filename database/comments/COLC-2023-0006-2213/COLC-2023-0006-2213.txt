First - don&#39;t call it Artificial Intelligence. Do not right that wrong terminology into law. <br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence is a misnomer, and that is at the heart of the Intellectual Property question. <br/><br/>It is more properly Machine Learning, where a &quot;machine&quot; is trained on a data set and &quot;learns&quot; via positive and negative feedback. <br/><br/>Ignoring the benefits and focusing on the problems that law may need to solve - the fundamental issue is the ownership of the contents of the data set. Obviously. <br/><br/>IF you don&#39;t own the input,<br/>and IF a human didn&#39;t generate the new work,<br/>THEN the output is not Intellectual Property and can&#39;t be Copyrighted...<br/>AND if the recipient of the output wants to monetize the output, they are at a minimum devoid of Copyright protections, and at max they are violating the original Copyright(s).<br/><br/>That means I could &quot;remix&quot; Disney content to print onto t-shirts to sell and at the same time be both liable to Disney and unable to prevent others from stealing &quot;my design&quot;. <br/><br/>This is an untenable situation.<br/><br/>The law should be updated to cover &quot;Non-human Assisted Art&quot;, with explicit rules about:<br/>* ownership of inputs and licensing/copyright requirements<br/>* minimum human direction of the non-human (computer, zoo animal, camera on a timer, etc...)<br/>* ownership of outputs and licensing/copyright rights<br/><br/>Much of so called AI art transforms/distorts the original sources so much that they are unrecognizable. However, the work of the original is used to train the machine. Should royalties be paid for this usage? <br/><br/>Future law must protect the owners of Intellectual Property from uncompensated use. <br/>And protect humans from having their likeness stolen and used via computer generated output for purposes they have not approved and generating revenue they do not share. (See writers&#39; and actors&#39; concerns/labor actions for contemporary examples.)<br/><br/>-------------<br/>Personal Perspective Data - I am a computer science instructor at a community college. We discuss and teach about Intellectual Property, plagiarism, copyright infringement, etc... as it touches on students current and future use of computers. This issue only minimally impacts me at this time. However, seeing good law created is in everyone&#39;s interest. In the future I might become an author, artist, or actor.
