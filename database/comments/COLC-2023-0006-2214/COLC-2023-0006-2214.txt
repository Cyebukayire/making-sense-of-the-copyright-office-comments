When AI is coping another person property, it should be treated as plagiarism or thief. People will read it and think that it was not made by anyone when it is in fact coping stuff.<br/>I admit to not knowing much about the AI text generation. So while I would say that anything that an AI has created should be treated with no copyright, I will defer and leave that to others. For all I know, the one who initiate the programs could have put the base information in to narrow down the writing. Although I am still of the opinion that people are lazy to use AI instead of writing it out themselves.<br/>When violations happen, it should be punished equally to both developer and the user. The developer because they made a program that is stealing from others and the user for putting down the prompt.<br/>AI should not tough anything involving human likeness and issues with that. Machine can never get the person right and the images may have been taken from somewhere else. If it is a human appearance, it can run into the issue of uncanny valley.
