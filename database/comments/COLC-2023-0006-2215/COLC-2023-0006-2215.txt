All I can say is that if AI is used, then there should be a tag to let viewers know if AI had any involvement. Can help people develop their ideas, but at the same time, it can also limit ideas if everything is AI generated. It can even make it incomprehensible. And AI is a learning software, which means it can pick up some negative stereotypes. But again, AI can help people develop and try to perfect some ideas so that it can sometimes comprehend what they are thinking. So, if AI is used, the viewers need to know how; partial or entirely. I don&#39;t think AI should be banned entirely. Just find a way to let people know that AI or this learning software was used in their material.
