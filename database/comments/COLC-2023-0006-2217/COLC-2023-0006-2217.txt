Generative AI should only be allowed to have it&#39;s content copy-written if all of the content submitted to it was done so willingly and not stolen nor taken to be used as such without the original creator&#39;s knowledge or consent. This includes Chat AI, Writing AI, and Art AI. If AI was involved in the creation, it must be mentioned. All source images and written works also credited as well as the original creators and confirmation of their consent. Generative AI for personal use - yet publicly shared - should only be allowed if the source images or written works were given and granted permissions by the original creators and credited as such. Using AI to replace humans for a creative pursuit will only lessen and cheapen such works. It removes the human element of art and therefore makes the art itself moot. Art is an expression of emotion, regardless of the type. Creative pursuits cannot be captured in a similar manner by a program made of thousands of lines of emotionless code. It can only copy, never incorporate and improve.<br/><br/>Writing AI that improves on an individual basis with each user for entertainment is accepted so long as the program is credited. It is entertaining to see how horribly AI messes up something simple. Hilarious, even. It&#39;s not funny - however - when AI is starting to take human jobs that requires a human element, such as script writing, books, paintings, cover art, music, voice overs, voice acting, animation, comic book drawing, and etc. It becomes a poor and pale imitation.
