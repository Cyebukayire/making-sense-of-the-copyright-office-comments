As someone who works in various creative fields and is quite poor, AI-generated content has opened many doors that were otherwise closed for me. It is important to me that AI-generated art of all kinds remains open to the public.I also recognize that many (but not all) AI models use art with questionable or outright unethical sources to train on. However, as this is visual machine learning, the computer is quite literally learning how to create images and the names of things in the same way as a human mind. Since no one minds, if I look at their art to help me learn to draw or write better, I see no reason why we should disallow computers from doing the same. I do, however see the need to differentiate between AI and human-created content, but I do not believe it is the domain of government to decide how the division must be done, only that it must be done.<br/><br/>As such, I humbly request that any content generated by AI be officially designated as public domain. No one should be able to own raw generated content, otherwise, large corporations or citizens with spare computing power can simply generate uncountable images, check to see if anyone else makes the same or a similar image, and then sue for copywrite violations. That being said, any work done using AI-generated content that either uses it as part of a greater whole or recontextualizes it such that it has an artistic expression provided by a human must be protected.<br/><br/>AI is our future. No matter what our personal feelings are on the matter, that much is a fact. If one nation bans AI, it will be dominated by those who do not. We must ensure it remains a tool for all of humanity to use as we please. Otherwise, we will not have heeded the warnings of every cyberpunk author who ever took up the pen.<br/><br/>In a sentence: Raw generations ought to be in the public domain, free for anyone to use to create works under any license they see fit.
