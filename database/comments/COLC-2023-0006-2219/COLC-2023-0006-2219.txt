I believe that the created works of individuals should not be allowed for Artificial Intelligence to analyze. Artists, writers, and other creators should have legal protection of their works against Artificial intelligence. If their works are used without their consent, there should be monetary compensation as well as procedure to delete their works from the AI&#39;s database.
