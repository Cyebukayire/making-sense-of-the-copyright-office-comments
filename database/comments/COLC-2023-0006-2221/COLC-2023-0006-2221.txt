Using copyrighted materials in order to train AI should require explicit permission from the creator of said materials. This should be handled in an &quot;opt-in&quot; manner. Compensations should not be necessary if the original copyright holder is allowing explicit permission for their work to be used. I also do not believe that work created exclusively from an AI should not be eligible to be copyrighted. Owners of AI technologies should be liable upon infringement of copyrights.
