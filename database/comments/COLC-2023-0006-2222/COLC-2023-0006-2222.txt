As a civilian, general media consumer, and life-long visual artist in both traditional and digital trades, I believe that many of the latest uses of AI to generate artwork and video media in particular to be highly unethical, and to be infringing on the rights of work for many artists and creators who did not consent to their works being stolen to train such AI to replicate their time, energy, and hard labor with a lack of any sound agreement and fair compensation. Such use of AI is theft at its core, and most artists who have put in the years of effort to hone their craft and create our favorite content will agree that it is unjust for their property to be unfairly reproduced and their labor to be abused in these ways. It is equally unethical for AI to also be used to produce fake footage involving people or well-known actors to portray scenes that they did not consent to. AI has also been used to go beyond creative protection and issues of artist rights to also produce realistic, convincing, adult content by using imagery of unsuspecting victims who also did not consent, which can also lead to damaging effects both emotionally and physically, with the immediate potential to ruin someone&#39;s career and life. It is critical that laws be put into place that protect the rights all of these parties- the artist&#39;s works, the victims of digital abuse, and so forth.
