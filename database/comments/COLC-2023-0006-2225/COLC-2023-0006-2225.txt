I believe that AI is a tool that would benefit from being public domain.<br/><br/>Using AI is a way to mass produce content on a scale that would be impossible for patent offices to keep up with; not to mention that most if not all AI programs are trained on already copyrighted material. I don&#39;t think people should be able to make money off of AI and I especially do not think corporations will use it ethically.<br/><br/>I do not believe that something without human input should be eligible for copyright, especially when websites are being flooded by low-quality images and text documents that are obviously made by AI. I also think that having stronger copyright laws would hurt more people than it would help.<br/>
