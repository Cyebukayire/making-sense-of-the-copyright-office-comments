If the purpose of copyright, as has been supposed, is to protect the authorship, rights, material gain, and legacy of the creators of the copyrighted material, it is unconscionable to extend copyright to material produced by the so-called &quot;generative AI&quot;, or to give it it&#39;s more proper name, &quot;applied statistics&quot;. A prompt does not constitute creative endeavor-- if a teacher tells their students to produce paintings of a sunset, even if they give very specific instructions about the composition of that painting, those paintings are not copyrighted to the teacher. The machine algorithms being used to produce this material are not engaging in creative endeavor either-- it is synthesizing training data, much of which was itself under copyright which has been flagrantly ignored by the machine&#39;s creators, to match parameters and weights assigned in its code, with no conception of what the produced material is. It possesses no value or meaning, because the machine is not capable of calculating such things. This is extremely clear with algorithmic machines designed to produce text output-- the machine has been trained to produce &quot;naturalistic&quot; text which passes certain readability thresholds, but it has not and to date cannot be trained to produce text which it meaningful or reliably true. The machine is not capable of identifying truth or meaning, and these subjects are irrelevant to its output. It is designed to &quot;sound right&quot;, as the art generators are designed to &quot;look right&quot;, without any creative input being required.<br/><br/>Since neither the prompt-writers (the only humans involved in its creation) or the machines themselves are producing creative work, it is simply, categorically, not copyrightable. Allowing &quot;generative AI&quot; to continue without restriction does material harm to the actual authors who&#39;s work copyright is supposed to protect. It can and must be regulated, it&#39;s use in this current form must disqualify work from copyright protections, and it must not be permitted to infringe on existing copyrights. Systems which already infringe must be dismantled and rewritten. This is the only equitable path forward.
