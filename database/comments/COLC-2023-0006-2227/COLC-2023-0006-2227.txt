I do not think AI-generated content should legally be allowed to be copyrighted material. Copyright is about a person&#39;s right to what they have made. AI blatantly disrespects copyright law by taking people&#39;s personal copyrighted artworks and writings from across the internet and spitting out amalgamations of the things it took in. Also, it does not take human effort to create something AI-generated. Unless a significant portion of alteration has been done to a piece of AI-generated content, it was achieved on the backs of others copyrighted works by typing a few words into an AI engine. While the actual creation and coding of an AI machine takes significant effort, using an AI machine is undoubtedly not creating something you can claim as your own and can be done in fractions of a second.<br/><br/>The idea that someone else could take five pieces of my art and make a machine off of it scares me. The idea of someone taking the &quot;art&quot; it spits out and claiming it as their own disgusts me. The idea of them being allowed to legally profit off of my art at my own detriment makes bile rise in my throat. AI-generated art is not fair use, it is not transformative enough by human means, and I am asking the U.S. Copyright Office to consider the feelings of artists nationwide as well as my own feelings when creating copyright laws surrounding AI-generated content. Thank you for your time.
