I most definitely feel that there needs to be copyright regulation on the use of A.I. because I have seen quite a few cases where A.I. where an A.I. generator produced a work based on an artist&#39;s original work, often without that person&#39;s knowledge, their permission, and without receiving any credit or financial compensation. If A.I. is going to be used, it is imperative that it is done with explicit permission from the original creator, that that person is given their due acknowledgement, and receive appropriate financial compensation. Otherwise, A.I. generators should not use that work as a basis, and should be banned from doing so.<br/>
