I believe authors and artists should give consent and receive compensation to be included in a training set, and images and writing resulting from AI should not be eligible for copyright without significant further human manipulation/improvement of the generated image. It is taking authors and artists livelihoods and profiting off them. Thank you for considering this comment.
