You need to consider AI generated material such as &quot;artwork&quot; and voice replication as theft, not as a technology that should be protected. AI image producing programs only exist by utilizing a pool of already existing images produced by actual labour, effort and practice of professionals. Creators dedicate their entire formative years in education honing these skills to be actors, artists, musicians and whatever else. And to then to have all that undercut by somebody typing a prompt into a textbox to steal their work and replicate it; it&#39;s a blight on human expression and the celebration of the species that is art.<br/><br/>As a comparison, consider if there was a technology that could reproduce specific foods from restaurants by stealing the recipes of the establishment. In a world where anybody can replicate the entire menu from Mcdonalds or a 5star high class restaurant that is a slippery slope for the economy and for license protection.<br/><br/>Artists and creators are facing that right now with having their labour and material stolen, funnelled into these algorithms and reproduced for the sake of thieves to make easy money. They profit off of our work and nobody can do anything to stop it until AI is dealt with with a heavy hand.<br/><br/>AI Algorithms are an important technology to consider, however the focus should be on benefitting humanity in meaningful ways rather than producing stolen images which is doing absolutely nothing but hurting the creative industries in both profit and value. I want all algorithms that base their process exclusively on producing fake images based on stolen material to be outlawed completely so that these developers can actually focus on making AI software that has an actual purpose. <br/><br/>Artists and creators need to be protected, because if we enter an era where big corporations are able to produce new media like movies, comic books or music at a whim, without any contribution from actual staff, we&#39;ll wind up with monstrous profit in the pockets of the select few, who are thieves, and it will greatly damage not only the integrity of us as a species, but the economy in catastrophic ways.
