The Impact of Generative AI<br/>Generative AI affects creators who use the technology by allowing them to be more creative, generate ideas, and be more efficient and productive. Generative AI can also negatively impact some creators by introducing more competition and potentially reducing demand for labor. However, this is also true for many other professions, and there is no reason the profession of a creator should be protected from automation when that of a taxi driver is not.<br/><br/>For example, generative AI has allowed me to become more productive as a writer, but it has also reduced my ability to make a living as a writer. My response was simply to begin transitioning into a new field that is less under threat of automation, and my income no longer depends on being able to find clients.<br/><br/>Training AI<br/><br/>Copyrighted materials are often scraped from the web using bots. Some content is also manually curated and used to train models for specific purposes. I have never heard of copyrighted materials being licensed to be used for AI training. The materials used to train the models are not stored within the AI model because the model only stores weights that influence how the AI generates content in response to an input.<br/><br/>Generally, AI models are trained by having the AI attempt to generate an image or text and then compare it to the material it is being trained on. The difference between the generated art and the original art is referred to as &quot;loss.&quot; The model then adjusts its weights, which changes how it generates art in an effort to reduce loss. The goal is for the model to learn general concepts and underlying patterns in the training data but not to actually replicate the copywritten works. Sometimes, models replicate copywritten works, but this is referred to as &quot;overfitting&quot; and is undesirable and something that the trainers try to avoid. <br/><br/>The model learns to associate certain concepts with &quot;tokens,&quot; which are words or characters. It&#39;s possible for a model to be trained to associate different concepts with a token and to forget the material it has learned.<br/><br/>For the majority of the training data, it&#39;s not possible to know if the model was trained on the data unless it has been overfitted, given how much data is used to train the model. <br/><br/>Fair Use<br/><br/>I believe that most content generated by AI falls under fair use and is transformative. If a particular piece of generated artwork or text is very similar to an existing copyrighted material, the courts should determine whether the changes are meaningful when determining whether copyright infringement occurred. They should also consider whether the user knowingly infringed on an IP. I don&#39;t think other stages of training should be considered copyright infringement, and the only area of concern is with the image that is generated at the end of the process since it may or may not compete with an IP.<br/><br/>When infringement occurs, the party who is liable should be the party that knows they were infringing. For example, if the user was using Image2Image to deliberately replicate a piece of art, they should be liable. If a model is created that deliberately replicates the artwork of artists, the developer of the model should be liable.<br/><br/>I do not think it should be required for creators to opt-in or opt-out because using copywritten material for training data falls under fair use. I think consent should be obtained when art is created that is clearly meant to replicate a style of a specific creator, but I don&#39;t know if this should be required by law.<br/><br/>AI Copyrights<br/><br/>Writers and artists often use AI as part of their creative process. When an AI generates art on its own with no substantial human input, it should not be possible to obtain a copyright. However, if the work in question was changed by a human in a meaningful way, that individual should hold a copyright. This is similar to the concept of joint work, where more than one creator is involved in the creation of an IP.<br/>For pure AI-generated art, I think allowing the art to be copywritten would do more harm than good because of the speed at which AI can generate art. This can lead to the owner of the AI obtaining a massive library of copywritten materials and using this library to file copyright claims against other artists. I don&#39;t think copyrights are necessary to encourage the development of generative AI because there are already enough incentives to develop it, given how it can improve efficiency.<br/><br/>
