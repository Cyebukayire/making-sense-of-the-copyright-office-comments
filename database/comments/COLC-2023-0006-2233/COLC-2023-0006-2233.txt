Nothing an AI generates should be protected by copywrite and any credits given must include a list of all artists that the AI was trained on. AT BEST: AI created works should count as parody instead of original content and permissions to use voice, face, name, art, writing, etc needs to be in contract writing to use. If an AI wants to scrape a website for generative content, the administrators of that website should have to give similar consent. If an AI is found to have continued scraping data or usung the likeness or creative works of others without consent, heavy fines should be in place for the owner of the AI and there should be a felony charge of some sort for repeat offenders on a 3 strike rule.
