AI is a new form of Technology that first an foremost LEARNS FROM OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S WORK. Th government should take measures to protect the individual and collective group of creatives that fuels and contribute to society with their work. Artwork, literature- even the voice of a person should not be stolen with consent and use for profit. It&#39;s is exploiting thousands of people and already devaluing the time and effort that comes with the creative process. While it can have some pros, AI is ultimately a tool used by the people who use it, if unregulated and unchecked, it&#39;s dangers go past stolen creative work an caned to actual crimes such as impersonation and plagiarism. REGULATE AI USE.
