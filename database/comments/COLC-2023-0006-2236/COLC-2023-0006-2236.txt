In my opinion nothing created using AI should ever be eligible for copyright protection. All work created with AI is already stealing/copying the work of a real human creative. The work it is creating is often already a violation of copyright as AI has scraped, without permission or payment, the data of millions/billions of copyrighted works in order to copy them. Even if a human edits the work after a AI creates it there should still be no copyright protection given. That would be the equivalent of giving copyright to an editor who works on an authors book. As it is a long standing precedent that only humans can obtain copyright protection a machine can not be a creator/owner of copyright and a human who cleans up AI work is at most an editor.
