I believe that as it currently stands, AI generated works should not be protected under copyright law. These generative models do nothing more than produce derivative content complied from countless media created by human artists who are not compensated for or even asked permission to use their works. If AI generated content were allowed to be copyrighted then countless people would lose their jobs due to large corporations preferring the much less costly method of using artificial intelligence instead of hiring human creators. Mainstream artistic culture could be at risk of being dominated by derivative, randomly generated media that is completely devoid of the wonderful imperfections of the human expression. That&#39;s not to say that AI should be banned entirely, I believe it could be a very powerful assistive tool if used correctly, but that&#39;s all it should be in my opinion, an ASSISTANT to humans. It should not be used wholesale to create media from scratch without any human input whatsoever.
