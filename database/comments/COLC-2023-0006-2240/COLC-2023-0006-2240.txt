AI created works are, by their vary nature, infringing on the rights of artists across the world. Whether it be written word, spoken prose, paintings, or anything else one could create, AI is taught to steal and incorporate the designs and intellectual property of human artists to create their works. This is far from a creative derivative of human work and is merely a mashup of copies generated with no effort or intellectual energy spent on the creation process itself. <br/>By this I believe AI generated work should not be allowed to be copyrighted. The AI generates its recreations of art based off of thousands of other artists work and therefore all AI art, of created, should remain solidly in the public domain.
