Opt-in, or at least opt-out permission from copyright owner should be required before AI machines train with copyrighted materials. If opt-out, it must be well publicized that opt-out is available, and the procedure must be extremely clear and accessible. However, the problem with opt-out I think is that AI machines may have already used the copyright owner&#39;s content before they opt out. I don&#39;t imagine there&#39;s a way to &quot;undo&quot; the learning that&#39;s already been been done from the copyright owner in those cases.
