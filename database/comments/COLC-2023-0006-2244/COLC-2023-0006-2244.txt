Good Morning. I would like to submit my commentary on AI art and its negative impact on behalf of many American artists. AI art, while currently inferior to organic art by those who have mastered their skill, poses a significant risk to the income of creators, already there are projects and media that boast of their AI capacity through their creation. In reality, actively deciding to use AI decreases the economic opportunity and development of professional artists and disrespects their integrity as laborers. On an additional note, AI data is scraped from the hard work of artists, who receive no compensation from money made through products reproduced from this data scraping. For this reason, I do not think AI art has eligibility for copyright, as its production comes from the unlawful use of artists, both professional and hobbiests, creations. AI creations are not transformative, as there is little human input to their output aside from prompt writing.
