I&#39;m a small time writer who occasionally gets paid to write short stories for people and one of things is that lately, when I try talking about my work or get engagement for commissions I get told, &quot;Why would anyone want that? All you have to do is use chatgpt!&quot; Which is... hard to continue to trying to write especially if I want to publish one day.
