I&#39;m a recent college graduate working in a creative field. I -- and many others I know -- feel that artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to human intelligence and creativity. Computers have no stake in the game when it comes to the monetization of their work, they simply chew up and spit out variations on individuals&#39; expressions. Companies do have an interest in seeing this work monetized, but that interest does not serve the greater good. If the copyright office were to allow companies and individuals to copyright works generated by artificial intelligence, thousands of jobs would be lost and our understanding of human emotion and expression irreparably diluted, all in the service of corporations&#39; bottom line. If it truly exists to serve the citizens of this country, then the copyright office must not allow the copyrighting of any work generated in full or in part by artificial intelligence. There is precedent to stand on in this decision, and it must not be ignored.
