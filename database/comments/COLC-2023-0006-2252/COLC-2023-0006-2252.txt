I am a young artist in college. I am trying to get started making an income on my art via interaction and commissioning online. Posting my work to the web puts it at risk of being ripped by AI programs without my consent. I can only combat this so far with various methods such as watermarking and other tools. This applies to other artists written works as well, such as blog posts and works of fiction posted online with their works being ripped by programs similar to ChatGPT. Even Bing has a built in AI that you cannot avoid within the windows built in search feature, and all you can turn off in settings is &quot;Suggested Content&quot;. I don&#39;t want the future of &quot;content&quot; to be AI. It should be human artists making ART.
