Individual statement re: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the creation of copyright protected artwork<br/><br/>Carl Clingman, MA<br/>Independent Contractor<br/>Medical Illustrator<br/><br/>In my 34 years as a professional medical illustrator I have seen the standards of copyright protections for illustrators decline to an alarming state. It actually makes me glad I am retiring soon, but part of my income in retirement will come from residual licensing of artwork I have done throughout my career. That residual income is also part of my current income as it should be for a major part of the incomes of all professional artists.<br/><br/>That being said, it is vitally important for the United States Copyright Office (USCO), the courts, legislators, and the general public to understand that AI is only as creative as the human input it draws from to create visual imagery. If one is familiar with how AI works, you know it samples from every available source of the highest caliber works of creative people and experts in a particular realm. Take writing for example, AI systems will search and recombine elements and styles of the most notable examples of successful or award-winning authors to recreate narratives that read in those styles. The products of AI read very professional or very creative BECAUSE the source of the style(s) is from a professional or very creative human. Essentially, AI cannot produce anything of delectable quality on its own. It must rely on consolidating at least several great styles or faithfully representing one notable style.<br/><br/>The same is true for any visual artwork AI might create. There are recognizable styles represented in anything AI produces as it must sample from all the imagery to which AI has access (usually the internet). Many of those samples are copyright protected, or should be. It is certainly true artists have been allowed to copyright artwork they created incorporating the styles and even representations of other&rsquo;s original works. However, those works are interpretations, or they are amalgamations and are thus the product of conscientious human synthesis, not an inconsiderate digital pirate that doesn&rsquo;t feel the need to ask permission to lift parts of an artist&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s work.<br/><br/>All I ask as an medical illustrator trying to protect his Constitutional right to generate revenue from his creative talent, is that the USCO deny copyright to any artwork created by anything other than a human. That includes humans using AI as an instrument for creative input or output in the production of their visual art.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Carl Clingman<br/>621 Carnoustie Pl SE<br/>Pine Island, MN 55963<br/>
