As usual when new innovative tools appear, there is controversy on how they should be allowed to be used. Robots in factories, synthesizers, to name a couple. AI is a tool. One of the biggest complaints I hear is is that you can copy an artists style. What if I decided to paint a picture in the style of someone else? Is the copyright attributed to the inspiration? No, copyright goes to the one who created it. A big misconception that the AI is theft because they are using copyright material to train it on. Again, if I am studying to be an artist, I would gain inspiration from everything that enters my eyes. I can not be prevented from looking at copyright material, and looking at copyrighted material does not make me a thief. I am an artist/musician for many years. I find these new technologies extremely helpful. I often use artist names when describing what I want the AI to create. Not one, but multiple per image often. It is not a matter of trying to steal something, but to interact with the tool to get the best results I can. There are certainly differences, but AI learns in a similar way, in a sense, that a person does. Trying to limit the way the tools are used only inhibit the inevitable advancements that will be made to benefit all mankind.
