For context, I am a professionally published writer of short stories and poetry. &quot;AI-generated content&quot; is a deceptive and inaccurate term by its very name. There is nothing &quot;intelligent&quot; about these programs. They are not autonomous, sapient or capable of independent thought or creation; everything they produce is based on pilfering the words, images, and works of others. They would be more accurately described as &quot;plagiarism software&quot;.<br/><br/>To be frank: without the original, human-created works these programs base themselves on, their product would not exist. Everything they make, from text to art to sound, is based on the theft of human creation and bodily autonomies.<br/><br/>The majority of artists (and I use the term here to describe visual artists, writers such as myself, as well as actors and others whose very bodies are at risk of digital exploitation) do not consent to the use of their intellectual property to be used to train these programs. At minimum, it should be illegal to use the works of real human artists without their express consent. Consent should not be assumed, for it is absurd to expect every writer, painter, actor, and creator to find every user of this software and tell them they do not consent to use. If an artist does not provide individualistic consent for a particular program or user of said program, it cannot and should not use their work.<br/><br/>So-called &quot;AI art&quot; (including visual art, written material, and everything else) cannot and should not be allowed to be copyrightable. The reason is that this art was not made by humans but by programs mimicking humans. These programs wouldn&#39;t be able to generate output without real human work. Unlike, say, digital art made by a variety of artists with painterly programs such as Adobe Illustrator or Clip Studio Paint, to name a few, these &quot;AI&quot; programs do not involve any creative input on the part of a human operator other than telling the program which styles and individuals to mimic. So-called &quot;AI artists&quot; would not be able to duplicate the works they &quot;create&quot; if stripped of these plagiaristic tools and placed in front of an actual easel or given a copy of a digital paint program like Adobe Illustrator. If these &quot;AI artists&quot; cannot create work on their own merits, they did not truly make anything and thus cannot claim copyright or ownership.<br/><br/>The same is true of chatbots and &quot;AI&quot; that produce text, rather than visual material. Without human-written sources such as the New York Times, Encyclopedia Britannica, or various works of fiction that they pillage for grammar, content, and style, these programs would not be able to produce anything coherent, and the individuals operating the programs did not actually write anything. If given pen and paper or placed in front of a word processor, humans utilizing plagiarism software calling themselves &quot;AI artists&quot; would not produce this material on their own.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this software represents a novel take on an old specter of the creative industries: plagiarism. The tools used are more sophisticated than ever, but the result is the same--individuals who did not write, paint, or create material attempting to derive prestige, employment, and profit from said material. By using programs designed to plagiarize that would not be able to produce material without stealing from prior-existing work, these individuals attempt to posit themselves as wielders of &quot;AI&quot; to try and legitimize the process of artistic theft. But &quot;AI&quot; is not intelligent, and the people wielding it would not be able to create art on their own merits. It must be recognized as such, and regulated/legislated accordingly.
