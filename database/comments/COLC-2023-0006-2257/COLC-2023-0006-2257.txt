The advent of generative AI, much like any new tool, has empowered a new wave of creative individuals who may not have previously found success or possessed the same abilities in other mediums. With easier access to increased output, people can choose to pivot their creative efforts or maintain the belief that doing things the harder way is inherently more meaningful. As someone who has had to adapt my own creative process and train a model on my own content as part of a new workflow, I am firm in my belief that copyright protection should still be applicable to hybrid works. I view generative AI as a new tool rather than mere copying.
