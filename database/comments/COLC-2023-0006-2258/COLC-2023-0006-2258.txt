I strongly believe that AI has potential for great benefits but also great danger to society. I do not believe it should be able to profit off of learning from human artist&#39;s work and then put the same artists out of a job so that corporations can avoid paying humans a fair wage. Please keep this technology heavily regulated and support humans over profit. I do not believe anything made with AI should be able to be copyrighted and I believe that artists deserve fair compensation if their work is used to train AI.
