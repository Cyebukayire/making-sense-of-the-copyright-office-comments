As somebody who illustrates I have lost clients for children&#39;s books, character art, illustrations, etc. to AI art.<br/>People who are looking for a specific style are now able to turn to AI, input a specific artist or style they want to emulate and get an end result. <br/>The art that these machine learning models use are Not properly sourced. The art is often times stolen and fed into the program without the permission of the original creator.<br/>AI is an unregulated tool that is given art without discretion of the source that is then monetized by the AI provider. This hurts the same people that create the kind of art that is used to teach the AI program.
