I thank the copyright office for its request for comments on this matter.<br/><br/>AI generated content should not be copyrightable, since the entire technology is based on a violation of the very principles of the copyright.<br/><br/>The main issue is the so-called &ldquo;learning&rdquo; process, wherein the technology absorbs mass amounts of material (visual art, voice, or text) without permission of the copyright holder. Regardless of the semantics of how said information is gathered, stored, and manipulated, it is done without permission, compensation, or even attribution.<br/><br/>Granting any sort of copyright protection to AI generated content is essentially allowing copyright violation on a mass scale, and then giving legal protection to the organizations and individuals committing said violations.
