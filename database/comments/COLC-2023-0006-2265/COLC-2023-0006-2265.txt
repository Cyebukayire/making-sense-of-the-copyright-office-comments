I am against copyright for AI created content.  AI is not &quot;creative&quot; in the true sense of the word, it is simply predictive based on the data set it is given to predict from.  I do not want to see written work, art, etc created by AI that are eligible for copyright protections.  I am not against all use of AI or protections for the creation of AI programs, but the outputs of those programs are not the work of a specific creative person and do not fall under the intended protections of copyright.
