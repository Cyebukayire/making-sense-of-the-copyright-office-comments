Artificial Intelligence is a tool, and one that is easily abused at that. It has commonly be used in online spaces to steal the creative works and properties of independent creators in the name of so-called transformative content, as well as an attempt to drive human creativity out of artistic spaces. AI generated works, in my opinion, should not be protected under federal copyright law by any means whatsoever because they operate off the back of stolen or otherwise ill-gotten content. Furthermore, art, music, writing, and other user-generated content should be protected from AI training or scraping unless express consent (no, not baked-into-TOS-consent, express, separate contract, clear and transparent consent) is given by the content&#39;s creator. AI was originally meant to solve problems so that humanity could spend more time on creative endeavors, not the other way around.<br/><br/>Odyssey of the Mind has a great policy regarding AI usage. AI use is outside, unoriginal assistance, and is grounds for disqualification in creative competition. Copyright law should treat AI the same way.
