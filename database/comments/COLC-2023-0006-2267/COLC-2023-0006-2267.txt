I think AI-created works should not be copyrightable. While the work itself may be &quot;unique&quot; from some arguments, the way it works directly takes elements from other works directly. It&#39;s not inspired like how a human artist would be, there&#39;s no natural individual filter in AI to make it actually unique to the bot itself. Art forgery is such a difficult job because humans naturally have a mental filter to add unique details, like making the Mona Lisa smile a tiny bit more because that&#39;s how one views it or using a slightly different color because that tiny difference makes the forged work more appealing. Any such uniqueness filter in AI must be forced in by the bot&#39;s creator. This combined with the usual habit of AI bot creators to not get permission for the training images the bots require easily leads to cases of blatant plagiarism.<br/>As a secondary argument, I want to invoke the case Naruto v. Slater, more famously known as the monkey selfie copyright dispute. The final decision in this case is that animals cannot hold copyright under the Copyright Act because precedent does not allow for animals to file infringement suits, and nobody can file them on behalf of the animal. I would argue for AI, if we consider anything to be an &quot;artist&quot; in that scenario, it should be the bot. The creator of the bot doesn&#39;t create the art, they just code the bot to perform that task and provide a dataset to draw from when given a prompt. The person providing the prompt shouldn&#39;t be considered the artist either, as they do none of the &quot;work&quot; to make the art. Providing the prompt is more akin to commissioning a painting than putting a brush to canvas, and historically speaking, humanity has never considered art commissioners to be artists. There is no legal precedent for AI bots to be able to file copyright infringement lawsuits. The AI bots, therefore, should not be allowed to hold any copyright just as Naruto the Macaque is not allowed to hold copyright over any of his selfies.
