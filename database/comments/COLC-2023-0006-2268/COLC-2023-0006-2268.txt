AI is simply a tool that will help propel humanity to new heights by increasing productivity beyond imagination. Currently, certain AI systems have been implemented to help writers turn their original ideas into original stories. Such a high degree of input is needed by the user that I see no reason why it shouldn&#39;t be considered their own work and thus protected by copyright. If I decide the characters, the settings, the plot, etc.; how is the story not mine? The same can be said about artwork.
