Us actors and creatives have spent a lifetime on our craft and sharing the human feeling of connection and heart via multiple platforms. It&#39;s what the world needs globally. AI cannot replicate a genuine spirit, feeling, or an experience someone has lived through. Please respect and value the work of millions. AI should not be copyright-able. We must respect each other and work as a collective, a team, a family. If we can make decisions based on what will benefit and inspire future generations, we will continue to honor and respect each other&#39;s work and not allow AI or any hierarchy take away the heart of storytelling and the human feeling of connection the world needs right now and will always.<br/><br/>Raja Deka<br/>
