AI was trained on art that was taken off the internet without the consent of artists and without paying them. I find should not only be immoral but illegal.<br/>Why should corporations that are worth billions be allowed to benefit from art they didn&#39;t create. The use LAION dataset which is filled with possibly copyrighted material. Why aren&#39;t they in jail? The data was acquired for research and then used for commercial gain. That just reeks of them trying to exploit a copyright loophole.
