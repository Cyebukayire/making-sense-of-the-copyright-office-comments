As an artist I am strongly against the AI generating models such as Stable Diffusion. Those AI companies are not transparent at all about where and how did they collect images to train the AI, or if the original image owner is aware of how their works are being used. There is no way to trace back which images the AI used to generate their AI image. Unless the AI is only using images that are aquired legally, I think they are violating the original creators&#39; rights.
