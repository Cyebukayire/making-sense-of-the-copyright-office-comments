I do not believe that something generated by an AI should be able to be copyrighted in anyway, because there has been no creative input from a human. Simply giving a prompt to work off of is not significant enough to merit claims of authorship, in the same way that if I commissioned a person to draw a picture for me providing them all the details of what I wanted, despite having a degree of creativity in the whole matter I think it would be universally recognized the end product was not mine. The artist who drew it following my instructions (baring any prior contract) would clearly be the owner of any copyright on the work, and as AI should not be able to hold copyright over things produced by it, neither should anyone be able to copyright an AI work simply because they generated it<br/><br/>At no point are they making any input as the work is being produced. They make a prompt, wait, and then look at the finished product. This is not creative control, this is not their personal creative expression, and copyrighting it would do no public good<br/><br/>If I were to generate something, and then begin to alter it; if I digitally painted over parts of it or in other ways edited it, I think it would be reasonable that I should own copyright of my alteration. The work I had now produced, it would stand to reason I should be able to copyright, but the original I generated should remain copyright free for anyone else to do whatever they pleased with. It would be my own substantive changes that I owned, the actual creative work I&#39;d done, in much the same way that someone might cut up magazines in order to make a collage thereby deserving copyright over their final product while deserving no copyright over the magazines that they did nothing to author<br/><br/>Furthermore, I think it&#39;s very important to address the high levels of creative theft often involved with training of AI models<br/><br/>It is in disputable that many of the AI up to this point in time have had the work of unconsulted 3rd parties fed in to them. No permission was given, they were not made aware that their work was being used, given no chance to even voice an opinion, let alone give proper consent<br/><br/>I do not believe that any measure of fair use can be argued here. This is not akin to someone taking and substantively altering a work, rendering it in new light. This is far closer to a company that sells access to stock photos uploading pictures to it&#39;s portfolio without ever gaining permission from the photographer. There is no creative input in that case, simply entry into a catalog, and the way in which AI is trained is much the same in that regard. These are not transformative and creative acts when for example someone&#39;s photography is used to train an AI, nothing is actually done to the photo, it is simply added to a database for the AI to reference<br/><br/>The parts of AI that it seems reasonable to allow copyright on are things with actual human intention. The code of an AI is entirely reasonable to copyright in the same fashion as other software. However the end product has had no human interaction at any point along the way<br/><br/>The unfortunate truth is that the common acceptance of the phrase &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; has had a significant negative impact in how we understand this technology. It implies a degree of thought, a degree of decision making on the part of the program; there is none<br/><br/>These are programs like any other. They are remarkably fast, but in the end they are not making creative choices, they are simply referencing a data set and then making an amalgamation that best fits the parameters given. There are no acts of creation on the part of the machine, simply the execution of the program<br/><br/>In summary, when AI generates something, there is no creative action taking place. Before it begins, there is a degree of creative human input, but not to a degree that rises to the level of copyright in any comparable circumstance. Once the program is executed, anything that happens between then and the production of the requested work has exactly zero human input, and as such deserves no copyright. Creative action could be taken upon the requested work after it&#39;s completion, but that no longer involves AI and so is no longer pertinent to the question (and does not retroactively apply copyright to the AI generation, only to the creative actions taken to alter it)
