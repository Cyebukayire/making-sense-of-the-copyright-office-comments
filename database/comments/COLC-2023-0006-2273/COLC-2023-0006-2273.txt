Images and writing generated by AI should not be eligible for copyright. AI models can only recompile elements of things they are trained on; they cannot create something truly original that would be worthy of copyright. While AI can be incredibly useful for many applications, it is not and should never be considered a replacement for human creativity. Additionally, many AI models being used to replicate creative works have been trained using images and writing without the consent of the original copyright owners, and I believe copyright laws should be updated to specify that as a violation. Furthermore, it should be specified that social media companies and other content hosting platforms do not have the right to train AI models using images or writing posted to their platforms, unless the user explicitly allows this via an opt in, and companies should not be allowed to simply put automatic consent for AI use into their terms of service.
