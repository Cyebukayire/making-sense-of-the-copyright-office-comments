In December of 1890 Brander Matthews wrote an article on the Evolution of Copyright (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2139530).  Although the work is over a century old, I believe it can contribute some valuable insight into the proper way to deal with generative AI and copyright issues. <br/><br/>The first important thing it touches upon is how the idea of copyright arose from an initial &quot;perception of a wrong&quot; to be, eventually, enshrined as a &quot;legal right&quot;.   Let&#39;s note that the debate around generative AI makes it clear that a &quot;perception of wrong&quot; is currently widespread and pervasive. The essay also examines the distinction between stage-right and copyright and the recognition of that distinction led to different types of rights for different use cases.  The nature of the evolution of copyright from &quot;perceived wrong&quot; and its distinction from other rights, such as &quot;stage-right&quot; (the ability to perform a play) mirror our concerns with generative AI.  I think there is a need to develop the legal idea of &quot;training-right&quot; as a distinct legal conception.   <br/><br/>So are there any guides to help us with this development?  I believe the answer is &quot;yes&quot; and it arises from an evolving conception of how to ethically monetize indigenous knowledge.  For example, when a drug company creates a new product from an herbal cure there is often a conflict between different conceptions of IP ownership (communal knowledge vs well-regulated intellectual property rights).  I&#39;m no expert on the field but I know plenty of consideration has gone into these topics and they seem particularly germane to the AI issue because most discussion about AI training of generative models contain a conflict that, to my eye, appears to arise from different models of IP ownership-- one communal (such as the artist whose work was shared online) and one far more profit-driven (such as AI trainers using that art to train diffusion models.)<br/><br/>So, in short-- I believe copyright is not the proper way to frame the generative AI debate, but rather the recognition and development of training-right as a distinct legal entity and the corpus of existing work on ethically monetizing indigenous knowledge can, hopefully, provide some insight into how develop these legal entities.
