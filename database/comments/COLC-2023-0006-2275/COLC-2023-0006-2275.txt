AI Artists should have as much right to use their software as someone using Adobe Photoshop does for their art. I do agree that using someone&#39;s likeness without permission shouldn&#39;t be allowed, but as for EVERYTHING ELSE done with image generation software, it should be owned by the user. They use it as a tool. The same as a sculptor uses a chisel, or a painter a brush, AI artists use code.
