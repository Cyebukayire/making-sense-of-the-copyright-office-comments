Artificial Intelligence refers to an artificial entity with human-like intelligence. No such thing exists. Perhaps the name was chosen deliberately to misrepresent the reality of the product as anything other than a complicated algorithm. It produces media derived from the works of human artists(writers, musicians, actors, craftsmen, etc.), who never gave explicit permission for it to be used for that purpose. They were never even asked. Despite the abundance of human-made art in the public domain, the programs&#39; creators deliberately chose to train the AI on the copyrighted work of living artists, around the globe. A &quot;creator&quot; using AI generation to produce media has no more right to copyright the AI programs&#39; output than a person using a search engine should be able to copyright the results page. It should not receive copyright protection.
