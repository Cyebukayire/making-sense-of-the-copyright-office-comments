There is a definite need for further regulation regarding AI, particularly involving access for training data. I believe allowing AI unrestricted access to typewritten material not only disenfranchises the copyright owner, but also discourages the creation and release of new work. The threat of someones original work being used without their permission to train AI models acts as a deterrent for future creations preventing others from accessing and learning from them.<br/><br/>That being said, I understand that there is no getting past the need for AI training data. I think a good first step would be ensuring the work is only included if the copyright owner has given explicit permission for their original work to be used, and that they receive proper compensation for the continuous use of their property. To this end It is important that a publicly available list of all training data (meaning the name and copyright owner) is accessible to the public so there are no concerns about someone&#39;s property being used in a way they were not informed of and did not condone.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that any work generated from an AI system cannot be copyrightable due to the lack of human involvement. As far as the level needed to allow for the material to be copyrightable, I would ask another question: How much of an article or paper must be original thought for it not to be plagiarism? I would propose similar standards are applied to AI, the same percentage of original thought needed to prevent plagiarism would be a good starting point for identifying the percent of human involvement needed for the work to be considered copyrightable.<br/><br/>As for liability, I believe the selection of training data and anything generated using it falls solely on the developers and the companies responsible for creating and releasing the AI. User submissions should be checked for content matching that of copyrighted works (similar to a plagiarism detector) before being considered for use in training AI.<br/><br/>As for attributes not traditionally protected under copyright law, I think it&#39;s still important that they be protected from indiscriminate use by AI.
