As a creative, an integral part of art is communication; it&#39;s a way for creative people to express ideas and emotions in whatever way best communicates them. In every work and piece, an artist puts a part of themself, however minimally, so that ideas don&#39;t just stay ideas, and maybe someone out there agrees with them, too. It is this human connection that makes art more than just an aesthetic, and for this reason that AI-generated work should not be afforded the same regard (and copyright) as human work does. AI removes so much of the creative agency out of the process that it cannot be reliably said how much of the end result is attributed to the prompter rather than just the AI. This is made worse when the AI relies on data that it so far did not acquire with consent, yet tries to replace. Say nothing about the consequences of leaving AI unchecked in a world where trust has heavily eroded.<br/><br/>So, in regards to relevant issues:<br/>-AI should not use copyrighted data, at least without consent, as it often uses that data to emulate and plagiarize that data.<br/>-AI should not be afforded the same copyright as human work, as it does not function as a method of expression the same way.<br/>-AI liability should at least fall in part on the companies who scrape data where the shouldn&#39;t have. Perhaps even on the prompter, as they try to masquerade AI work as the work of another.<br/><br/>One other thing to add, whether this is the place to do so, is that AI should probably have some indicator to indicate if it is AI or not, as that knowledge will be integral going forward.
