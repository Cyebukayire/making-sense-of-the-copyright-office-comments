AI content should not be copyrightable under any circumstances. In addition to serving as an inferior replacement to a human writer or artist, AI content scrapes and plaigerizes from said human writers and artists without their permission. By definition, the AI inherently infringes on people&#39;s copyright and hard work, and turns out nothing but unengaging slop.<br/><br/>Copyrighted materials should not be scrape-able with AI either, or at the very least, not used without permission.<br/><br/>Support the writer&#39;s strike. Don&#39;t cross the picket line.
