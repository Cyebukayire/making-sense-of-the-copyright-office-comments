I am an author, and I have many friends who are authors. I am also an avid reader. It is always immediately apparent to me when I have inadvertently stumbled upon a piece written by AI, in the same way that you would immediately recognize a styrofoam packing peanut that has fallen into a bag of Cheetos. Although AI generated works can have the appearance of a piece of writing (more or less intelligible syntax), I have never read one that has any of the intellectual or emotional relevance of a piece written by a human. Usually they don&#39;t even make a particularly good point. I have read books that have brought me to tears, works that I would spend the rest of my life defending if I had to. But these works are extraordinary BECAUSE they were written by humans who have intelligence and empathy and a unique perspective. No AI will ever have a perspective worth sharing, because they&#39;re not generating unique art. They&#39;re simply regurgitating information that they scrape from other sources. Why would I read a book by an author who doesn&#39;t care what they&#39;re writing about?? An AI cannot possibly care. They&#39;re not actually intelligent, despite the name--they&#39;re simply random number generators that calculate the probability of a word coming after another word in a series of different sources. They cannot have emotions or ideas worth expressing. I suppose AI-generated content is acceptable if you are simply interested in generating &quot;content,&quot; i.e., not art, simply something that you want to sell to blank-eyed buyers. But copyright exists to protect the art that is created by artists, work that moves us, work that is important to the human experience, and an AI can never generate that. It is absurd to suggest that AI works have the same value that human works of art do. They should not be given the protection that artists have.
