As a working artist, I have seen large amounts of AI generated work flood the places I have used to create and share my product. These AI works have been created with training models that took the work of artists without consent and used them as training data. They are now being used to produce content that directly competes with my work and drowns it out. Many users of this AI technology are also imitating artists who work without them, claiming that their work is hand-crafted. They are stealing our labor and trying to reap the benefits of it without any of the work needed to put in to achieve it. <br/><br/>As someone who used to love producing and consuming art, the entire existence of this AI technology has been a massive detriment on creative spaces and the craft as a whole. It has not empowered any actual artists to keep creating, but rather threatened our livelihood and lowered the standards of work considerably due to mass produced products of low quality.<br/><br/>Companies should not be allowed to take what we make, without consent or compensation, and plug it into their training models. None of us consented to this.
