In my reckoning, the material an AI program was trained on is the primary issue in determining copyright. If the material was in the public domain, any piece produced by the program should be in the public domain as well, because such programs are based on a statistical re-scrambling of all the material they trained on. These AI programs struggle to produce something sufficiently different from their training sets to merit a new copyright. They currently just straight up copy bits from their training data. Therefore, in order to copyright anything produced by an AI, the person or corporation seeking the copyright should have to hold rights to both the AI program and its entire training set from the first steps of developing the program.
