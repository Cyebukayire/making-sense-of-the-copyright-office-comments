I am someone currently working in IT. I am also a hobbyist artist. Currently, I can see both the potential benefits and detriments Artificial Intelligence and machine based learning could bring to everyday processes. As much as I would love functional AI that could streamline/automate processes in things such as coding or using it as a reference when creating art, I have seen too many cases of bad faith use. I would love for regulations to include stronger protections for artists so that their art cannot be scalped for sample data. Publishing sample data whenever AI is used in a public setting would be nice too. But mainly I want opt out consent options when AI tools are implemented, and I want those agreements to have legal weight/be open to legal penalty.
