So called &quot;A.I&quot; art is an affront to the very concept of art and human creation of it. To legalize and copyright &quot;A.I&quot; art would be the same as copywriting a randomly generated string of numbers. Stupid and unreasonable.<br/><br/>Art is a human using human expression to create a piece of color and line to invoke human emotion. &quot;A.I&quot; art is to spit in the face of that fact by scanning thousands of pieces of art made by humans and having a machine  copy it.<br/><br/>Nothing of AI art is art.<br/><br/>It is not art. Therefore it is not copyrightable.<br/><br/>
