I am an artist and a writer, someone who&#39;s livelihood could be seriously impacted by AI and the decisions you make when creating laws concerning AI. <br/><br/>9. Should copyright owners have to affirmatively consent (opt in) to the use of their works for training materials, or should they be provided with the means to object (opt out)?<br/><br/>I strongly believe this should be an opt-in situation. I have published lots of writing and art over the years online, to both big social media/ writing / art websites (such as twitter.com, archiveofourown.org, deviantart.com, ect...) as well as on personal blogs. There have been multiple instances where my work was scraped (scraped is a term generally used to describe large-scale data collection on the internet), as the websites the work was posted to was picked up by the Common Crawl (a non-profit that scrapes the internet for data around once a month which AI like ChatGPT is known to train off of). <br/><br/>I did not consent to my work being used to train AI. I find it very violating that it has, and that I had no way to protest it. People are using generative AI to make money, as they sell artworks and writing made by it. People are making money using an AI trained on my work without my permission. <br/><br/>Opt-in is much more ethical and easier to implement then opt-out. Let&#39;s examine this more closely. <br/>If I opted out, I&#39;d have to indicate what was made by me, yes? So that they&#39;d know not to use it to train the AI. I&#39;d have to go and track down all my work that I ever posted online: across dozens of accounts over a handful of websites over two decades. I&#39;d never be able to track it all down. Not to mention if other people reposted my works to places I wasn&#39;t ever aware of to begin with, I&#39;d have no way of knowing about it. How does the AI differentiate my work from others, If I post my work over multiple accounts with different usernames? It can&#39;t, not without me putting in an unrealistic and unfair amount of time and legwork. Many artists and writers are in the same boat as me, especially if they grew up with the internet and made accounts when they were young that they may not have access to anymore or haven&#39;t accessed in years and have forgotten about. In this situation a lot of people might also never even have heard of AI and would have no chance to object before their copyrighted work is used. You can&#39;t opt out of something you don&#39;t even know exists. And if you do learn about it, it might be too late: the AI that used your data to train could have produced all sorts of things. You might be able to retroactively remove someone&#39;s works from a training dataset, but you can&#39;t really track down all the things it was used to generate in the meantime. People used the AI when it was using your data to train itself: people, potentially millions depending on how long you didn&#39;t know this was happening, made text and images with the AI that trained on your data and you can&#39;t go and undo that. <br/><br/>Opting-in would be much easier and clear-cut, with little room for accidental breaches of consent. I would submit to the data collectors the work I was willing to share with them. I always imagined this could work as either websites having a tickbox when posting that says something like &quot;yes, i consent to data scraping for the uses of training AI&quot; so you can opt in or out on a work-to-work basis, making it very clear whats off limits and what&#39;s not. A centralised databank would also work: The company or entity wanting to train an AI could have a place where you could go and upload your work if you wanted it to be used in training data. They could also go to individuals and ask them directly, if they&#39;re looking to use a specific person&#39;s work.<br/><br/> 9.1 Should consent of the copyright owner be required for all uses of copyrighted works to train AI models or only commercial uses?&thinsp;<br/><br/>The consent should, in my opinion, always be necessary for commercial use. It&#39;s not fair to artists that people can train an AI to create work indistinguishable in  content, style and atmosphere to their own and then sell it. They&#39;re making money off their artwork without the artist getting any compensation! This is even worse for commission artists: why would people go and commission art from them when a program can make art just like it for free? <br/><br/>This is different to when a person replicates another person&#39;s style/skillset. First, doing that is really hard and can be time consuming: you have to familiarise yourself with their line weights, their compositions, their subject matter, how they shade, render, sketch and colour, their techniques and often with non-digital art, their materials. It&#39;s not really viable enough to pose a threat to someone&#39;s livelihood, because the artist replicating the style/skillset would be making a limited number of art pieces, and if they sell them at all, it would still be for money. Compare this with an AI that can make hundreds of art pieces a day for free after being given your art to train on.
