Hello, I&#39;m reaching out about the discussion about AI and copyright. I believe that under no circumstances should anything with any Artificial Intelligence involvement should be able to be copywritten. There is no human behind it, and there is also an entire mess because someone else had to write the AI, so who truly owns what the AI put out?<br/>Nobody. Because the only way an AI can create is by stealing from already copywritten works. That&#39;s all there is to it.
