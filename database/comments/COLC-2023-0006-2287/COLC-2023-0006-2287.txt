In order to protect the growth of human generated art (visual, written, in any medium), Artificial Intelligence algorithms and the people that program them should have to obtain express opt in permission from the creator or their subsidiaries before an AI can be allowed to &quot;scrape&quot; copyrighted content for the purposes of machine learning or other content creation.<br/><br/>Stringent rules such as this would protect the unique value of human generated art (or prose, or writing, again any artistic medium) from infringement. Compensation for violations should be treated as just that; copyright infringement. This would not disproportionately impact low level writers and artists or fan content, those are straw arguments. A flesh and blood fan creates fan content because something about it inspired them: AI, not matter how ingenious the initial programming,  cannot be inspired. <br/><br/>Further, AI generated works should not be eligible for copyright protection if the metric of of human involvement is not the overwhelming source of creative work and development. Any written work created with more than say 2% AI involvement, should not be eligible for copyright protection. To allow for the continued use of computer graphics or CGI, it would make sense to be a bit more lax and set the bar at no more than 10% AI involvement in the generation of visual graphics. An AI cannot create something on its own and it can&#39;t file for any copyright protection on its own (or it shouldn&#39;t be able to). Claiming a civil protection like copyright requires standing; a computer cannot maintain standing to sue for a protection like copyright because it cannot be damaged if protection is denied.
