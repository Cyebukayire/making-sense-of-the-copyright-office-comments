Copyright should only belong to a person who is/was alive. Machines are not alive and therefore do not get the privilege of receiving copyrights. The purpose of a copyright is to ensure that an individual is compensated for the work they have done and this will promote even more work. This is creative and original. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has not created anything, it has just reconfigured what was already there. Because of this AI should then be paying the original creator under copyright laws for the adaptation of the work. AI should not receive copyright protections.
