AI generated content exists only to create new content without giving a content creator their due as a creator. AI generated images use a computer program to steal portions of an extant pieces of art to make an amalgam piece, a chimera that never knew the stroke of a painters brush, nor the mark of a pen. They are merely shredded copies of the originals pasted back into shape by an algorithm. <br/>AI generated written works do much the same, stealing the lines of writers in a rush to cut out the middleman, whether it be the novelist or a journalist.<br/>AI exists as a way to destroy a portion of society who help create the American culture, a portion that is already underpaid and undervalued by corporate America, despite consuming a huge amount of art and writing every year.<br/><br/>While I despise what it is and what it represents, deliberate theft, an opt-in system for artists, writers and musicians of all stripes to allow specific portions of their content to be used for training AI would be acceptable. However, nothing made by AI, nor the prompts used to create that, should be copyrightable. A computer did every amount of the work of compiling the content, and as such copyright should not apply to them. Also as such, what would cause a computer program to compile in such a way should not have copyright apply, either.
