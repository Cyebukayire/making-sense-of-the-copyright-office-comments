Regarding issue 1 (the use of copyrighted works to train AI models):<br/><br/>I do not think this should be permitted at all. There is no reasonable way to compensate the individuals whose work has been scraped and put into the woodchipper to train these AI models, as they come from every part of the world and there are so many of them. Their permission was never obtained. Using copyrighted works to train generative AI should be considered infringing--and due to the sheer scope of how much infringement it entails, and its makers&#39; intention to replace human artists with it, and how much harm it has caused to the livelihoods of human creatives, it should likely be considered a criminal offense. The world has a vast trove of public domain works that could be used for this purpose instead.<br/><br/>Regarding issue 2 (the proper scope of copyright protection for material created using generative AI):<br/> <br/>I cannot stress enough how much I hope that you will never grant the legitimacy of copyright to AI-generated works. Copyright should serve the purpose of protecting an artist&#39;s work against theft and exploitation by others. Not only are these generative AIs not people (let alone artists), but they were trained on images and writing scraped from the internet without regard to consent, copyright, or legality. <br/><br/>Consider what would happen if AI-generated works were to be granted copyright. Copyright offices would be crushed under a deluge of it, unscrupulous studios and publishers would fire artists en masse and replace them with it. Most artists already struggle to make ends meet and are exploited by industries that undervalue them.<br/><br/>Regarding issue 3 (how copyright liability principles could apply to material created by generative AI systems):<br/><br/>I am of the opinion that liability should fall primarily (though not totally) on the developers if generative content is found to be infringing. They built the machine (out of stolen content, may I add); it should fall upon their heads if it creates infringing content. Large studios and similarly well-funded entities using the generative AI should still be punished harshly and made to reimburse the infringed party as they should have the resources to do a little research and make certain they&#39;re not ripping someone off.<br/><br/>Regarding issue 4 (artists and performers concerned about generative AI systems&#39; ability to mimic their voices, likenesses, or styles):<br/><br/>I have certainly seen this happen (notably to artist Kim Jung Gi shortly after his death), and it&#39;s a valid concern, but it pales in comparison to what it implies--that generative AI can be used to impersonate others for purposes of fraud, blackmail, and so forth. That seems like a fine reason to outlaw it altogether.<br/><br/>Art is and always has been a matter of communication between people. AI-generated content has no place seeking the protections we give to such a fundamental part of the human experience. It&#39;s a machine blindly making permutations of work that was stolen from humans. Those who see this technology in a positive light often credit it with bringing their ideas to life. When I wanted my ideas brought to life, I learned how to draw--and as anyone who has done so can tell you, the people outsourcing their dreams to a sludge-making machine have robbed themselves of one of life&#39;s finest and most accessible joys.
