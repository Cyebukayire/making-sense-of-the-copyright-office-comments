While the use of AI for creative work is unethical and threatens the jobs of millions of people, the biggest risk is having pop culture as a whole stagnate completely. While AI can copy anything, widespread use of it will result in it learning only from itself. This will result in decades of derivative artwork unable to evolve due to its incestuous means of being created based off of other AI generated derivatives. Art in 20 years will look exactly the same. We will no longer have great American artists and people will become disinterested in a media world incapable of meaningful reflection. AI is not the end of artists, it is the end of art. This isn&rsquo;t an exaggeration. AI cannot improve or adapt, only copy. AI art is the sheer cliff at the end of a journey traveled by centuries of artists who have enriched their communities and their culture. <br/><br/>Also everyone already hates AI. It&rsquo;s for the good of the industry that AI artwork is unable to be copyrighted for the sake of the artists and the consumers.
