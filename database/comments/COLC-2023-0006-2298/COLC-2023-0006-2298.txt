AI makes art through the unauthorized use of real artist&rsquo;s work. It can only plagiarize. A great example of this plagiarism is GameStop&rsquo;s infamous AI generated NFTs of which one turned out to be nearly identical to a photo of a man falling from the world trade center during 9/11. Not only was the photographer&rsquo;s work clearly used in a way that violated their rights (and the rights of the 9/11 victim whose likeness was stolen), the whole situation was unethical and disgusting. AI cannot be trusted to respect artists or people, obviously. It cannot make ethical decisions, only create plagiarized Frankenstein &ldquo;artworks&rdquo; by stealing from real artists at a rate that is unregulatable.<br/><br/>The whole point of copyright is so your work can&rsquo;t be stolen and resold. Copyrighting AI art is an oxymoron.<br/><br/>If enough people don&rsquo;t speak out against this, at the very least people should be required to let people know clearly when an artwork is AI generated. One of the worst things about AI currently from a working artist&rsquo;s standpoint, is that someone can be selling their artwork online and you have to wonder if they really made it or just generated it from a prompt. There&rsquo;s nothing to stop people from saying they made it themselves despite it being made from an AI&rsquo;s database built by billions of stolen pieces.
