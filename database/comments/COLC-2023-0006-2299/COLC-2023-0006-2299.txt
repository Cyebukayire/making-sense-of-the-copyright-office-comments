The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly generative models like GPT-4, has raised important questions about the ethical and legal implications of training these models on copyrighted material. This comment argues that using copyrighted material to train generative AI models should be considered &quot;fair use&quot; under Title 17, Section 107 of the United States Code.<br/><br/>Legal Framework<br/>According to Title 17, Section 107 of the United States Code, &quot;fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.&quot;<br/><br/>Purpose and Character of Use<br/>Generative AI models serve a transformative purpose by creating new, original content based on the data they are trained on. The training process does not replicate the copyrighted material but rather learns patterns and structures to generate new content. This transformative use adds new expression and meaning, fulfilling one of the key factors courts consider when determining fair use.<br/><br/>Nature of the Copyrighted Work<br/>The copyrighted material used for training generative AI models often spans a wide range of content, from factual data to creative works. Factual data is generally more likely to be considered fair use. However, even when creative works are part of the training data, the AI model does not preserve the specific expressive elements of those works but abstracts them into a broader understanding of language or patterns, further supporting the argument for fair use.<br/><br/>Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used<br/>Generative AI models are trained on vast datasets that include snippets from many sources. The proportion of any single copyrighted work in the training data is minuscule, often just a few sentences or paragraphs. This limited use is another factor that courts consider when determining fair use and should weigh in favor of allowing copyrighted material for AI training.<br/><br/>Effect on the Market<br/>Using copyrighted material for training generative AI models does not serve as a market substitute for the original works. The AI models do not reproduce or distribute the copyrighted material in a manner that would affect the market value of the original works. The new content generated could expand the market by creating derivative works or inspiring new forms of creativity.<br/><br/>Societal Benefits<br/>Beyond the legal arguments, there are compelling societal benefits to consider. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize fields like healthcare, education, and scientific research. Restricting the training data to non-copyrighted material could significantly hamper the effectiveness and applicability of these technologies.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>In light of the above arguments based on the &quot;fair use&quot; provision in Title 17, Section 107 of the United States Code, as well as the transformative nature and societal benefits of generative AI, I strongly advocate for the allowance of copyrighted material to be used in the training of generative AI models.<br/><br/>I urge the relevant authorities to consider these points carefully and to update the legal framework to reflect the evolving landscape of AI technology.
