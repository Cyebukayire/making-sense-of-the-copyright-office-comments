I believe that if someone uses AI as a tool, and not a co-writer, the work should be copyrightable. Meaning if they generate ideas, or even text, and edit and iterate on it, that work should be copyrightable. This can be proven by the length of time the work has been in production. You can prove that by the number of files the author has (if they saved their work daily) with iterations from the beginning to the end. If a work uses tools and takes under a week, it more than likely is an AI generation copy and paste job. These should not be copyrightable.
