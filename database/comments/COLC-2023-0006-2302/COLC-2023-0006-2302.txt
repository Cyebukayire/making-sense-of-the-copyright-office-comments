I have been a published author since 1984. I do not think that LLMs should be restricted from training on copyrighted material. Studying the patterns in text and art is how all writers and artists learn their craft. Many start out by pastiching favorite creators: Lovecraft emulated Poe, Harry Clarke modeled his style on Beardsley, and so on. Even in a mature style, established patterns of text and art are discernible. If we do not regard that as plagiarism in humans, we shouldn&#39;t do so when it&#39;s executed by AI. Restricting AI to training on public domain works would stifle the usefulness of the technology for no good reason. The existing rules of copyright are already adequate protection for authors -- that is, no direct reproduction of the specific words another author used. Patterns of language are not only permissible, they are essential for the use and development of the language.
