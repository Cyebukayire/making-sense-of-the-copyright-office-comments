It would be unreasonable for AI-generated content to be copyrightable, because the people who tell the AI to generate it didn&#39;t make it - it&#39;s not their intellectual property. It&#39;s not even the intellectual property of the people who programmed the AI, because the AI has made that content by digging through the internet and stealing bits and pieces of other people&#39;s work. It&#39;s like taking the entire internet, putting it through a blender, and then rearranging the remaining fragments into something resembling a coherent work.
