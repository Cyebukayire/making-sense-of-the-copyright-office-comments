As currently implemented, &ldquo;AI&rdquo; should not be allowed to gain copyright for works created using it. The issue is that current &ldquo;AI&rdquo; and all &ldquo;AI&rdquo; for the foreseeable future does not create. What it instead does is steal portions of other works, either copyrighted pictures or other copyrighted books, and mashes them together. There is no actual creation on the part of the AI. These &ldquo;AI&rdquo; programs are yet to achieve the necessary &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; to actually be AI instead of simply being programs that mash together other works that they have been trained on.
