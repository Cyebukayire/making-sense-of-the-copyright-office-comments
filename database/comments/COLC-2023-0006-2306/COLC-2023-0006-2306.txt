AI is uncontrolled beyond belief and should be given guidelines and rules to follow regarding the use of other individuals and companies property and created endeavors. These materials, written, digitally made, and otherwise, should have the same protections from AI as they do from others stealing their work for other use. Any AI actors who steal these materials instead of getting proper use agreements made and signed should have punishments or be shut down altogether. Otherwise, there will be a collapse in created and written work like no other in which the improperly labeled &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; will not only regurgitate these stolen materials in unregulated and preposterous ways, but will also take away the support of the public towards those that made what it stole. We are already seeing this in the excessive use of AI engines taking the work of digital artists and the public utilizing these to &ldquo;create&rdquo; work instead of supporting the hardworking artists that developed their style over years or even decades. Until we can better understand AI as a random pattern generator and not truly intelligent, as well as determining how using stolen material can be regulated, its existence should be put on pause.
