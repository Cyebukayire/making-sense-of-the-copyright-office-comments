It&#39;s theft. AI art operates by manipulating images that it finds online, copyright be damned. These aren&#39;t paintings, they&#39;re glorified collages of stolen material, and due to the nature of the models used there is no feasible way to ensure that any particular program is trained only on free use / public domain imagery. Even if it were possible, once the program is in the hands of someone less scrupulous they&#39;ll just feed it the works of their favorite private artist / designer to have it churn out similar work. There are cases of this documented on reddit, Xitter, and other message boards and social media all over the internet. There is literally no way to filter copyrighted material from the model, and because of that I don&#39;t believe it can be called transformative--especially when the goal often cited is to create works identical to those of the artists whose work has been fed into the program. Maybe not a 1:1, but the works are meant to look like they were produced by that person... using that person&#39;s works. There is no critical, satirical, or educational merit that makes them transformative. They aren&#39;t commenting on the subject matter in any way, just imitating it by scraping and rearranging existing works.
