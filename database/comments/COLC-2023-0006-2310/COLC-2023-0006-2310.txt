AI should require direct author permission to use a given piece of content. And any author on any service should be able to say no for any of their work. No ToS should include giving AI permission to train on existing or future works.<br/>For example, I have written essays for school in google docs. Right now, google wants to train AI on all of my essays. They should not be able to do this. They should be required to ask for each essay, and should have to wait until I say yes for a given essay before they can use it. Saying no should be free and should be easy. <br/>I worry that future essays I write will be flagged for plagiarism when I turn them in because AI will train on them while I am writing, and some other student may use AI to &quot;help&quot; them write their essay, and our essays will sound the same because AI stole phrasing from my essay and gave it to them.
