The inherent problem with AI is plagiarism. Any AI program that you see has been trained off of other people&#39;s work without their permission and that can not be copyrightable. Any attempts at AI need to collect express permission from the creators of anything they want to feed into their program for it to regurgitate later on. AI programs are not the same as people in that while people can take inspiration from others&#39; creations and then create their own original things, an AI program does not truly understand what it spits out. The AI only looks at it&#39;s database of what has been fed into it and look for patterns or similar things and then copys and mashes together it&#39;s best attempt at looking like it made a real thing that fit in the pattern of what would be expected for its prompt. <br/>
