Hi! I am a professional writer. I have a degree in English from WVU. I have made a decent part of my living from writing, and I have many friends who specialize in other forms of art. Every single one of us have been materially, concretely impacted by AI. Whether having our work scraped and used without pay to generate art or losing commissions because people would rather use a machine than pay a fair wage, this has affected all of us. <br/><br/>AI is a tool like any other. In the right hands it can produce wonders. However, the complete lack of oversight and regulation regularly leads to art theft, deepfakes, and other immoral acts. AI should not be copyrightable as it is because many of these learning systems are built on copyright infringement themselves. They will deprive honest Americans of work in fields that are already incredibly difficult to make a living in. To make these things copyrightable hurts many, and helps only a few people.
