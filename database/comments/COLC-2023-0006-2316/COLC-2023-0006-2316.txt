Thank you for taking the time to focus on this topic and for opening it up to the public. My young sister&#39;s future career as a artist is at stake so I am writing this for her. The use of an author&#39;s or artist&#39;s work without consent or compensation in the training of ai in my opinion is unethical. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &quot; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive<br/>Right to their respective Writings and<br/>Discoveries.&quot; Until a work enters the public domain works should not be used in the training of ai without the author&#39;s or artist&#39;s consent. Thank you for reading what I have to say as well as for taking it and the thoughts of the rest of the public that have commented. It is appreciated.
