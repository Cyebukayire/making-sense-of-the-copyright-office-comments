It goes beyond copyright. Museums are filled today with remarkable artist achievements like cubism and impressionism and even perslective drawing. Now my daughter is at art school dreaming of one day having her own name in the art world&hellip; and she cant do anything else. She isnhandicaped and cant hold any other job but artist.<br/>She was blrn to create art and has been doing it si ce she was a baby. Our entire family is like that. But of she finally creates a style or character of her own and posts it while in school - some billion-dollar corporation with automatically scrape it and offer it to the masses witjout her getting any credit or any compensation for her contribution to mankind. And with no results for her artwork - and this goes for every artist - she has no reason to exist on this earth. I am an artist and writer with a 30 years career - and I would have died a long time ago without being able to make a living on my souls need to create. AI generated content is an attack on humanity. <br/>No burger flipper committed suicide because they couldnt flip burgers any more. But artists will. Historically, they already have. <br/>My entire career has been fighting people pretending that their stupid idea is the only thing valuable in the project, when the reality is that I&rsquo;ve heard their stupid idea a dozen times from a dozen other uncreative people. It is ALWAYS a human&rsquo;s creation and inventiveness and decision making that changes the world. When people hand over creativity to machines, they are literally killing creativity in our species - and the fact that our current economic system rewards the uncreative masses over genius is a crime against humanity. And these criminals actually WANT artists to die out. They WANT the average noncreative person to simply generate whatever rehashed fantasy they imagine instead of experiencing anything nee - knowing that dulling the worlds creativity is another way of enslaving it. And soon, artists will die out completely, many taking their own lives.<br/>I didnt choose to be an artist.<br/>I actually thought I was being a rebel - driven to art and storytelling from an early age at every opportunity. It was only after a good career that my father informed me<br/>of  at least three previous generations of artists in my lineage that he hid from me.<br/>Creating is my biological<br/>imperitive. I can do nothing else. <br/>My clients and bosses have been trying to get rid of me for decades. I used to think it was to save money - now I know they reallly want me to die. Or rather go extinct. This is the one case when government has to do whats right for the species against the &ldquo;will&rdquo; of the public and the pundits and the corrupt political donors. Dont fail us. Our blood will be on your hands. And you will be responsible for letting people turn into insects. (Which is what Hitler wanted BTW. Thats why he named the Volkswagon for the public the &ldquo;Beetle&rdquo;. Look it up.)
