Thank you for considering this important topic. I believe developers of AI models must receive formal permission from copyright holders before training their data on copyrighted material, and that the use of copyrightable material in training data without that permission is a violation of copyright.<br/><br/>Further, I agree with the Copyright Office&#39;s current stance that &quot;copyright protected both the human-authored text and human selection and arrangement of the text and images, but not the AI-generated images themselves.&quot; and that &quot;where a human author lacks sufficient creative control over the AI-generated components of a work, the human is not the &#39;author&#39; of those components for copyright purposes.&quot; I urge you to maintain that stance.
