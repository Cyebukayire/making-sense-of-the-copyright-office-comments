I believe that AI should not be able to be copywritten, as it is made by a machine and not a person. Also, when somebody makes an AI image/story/music/etc generator they should have to compensate artists and writers and give them credit, or only use public domain works. With the way the law is now no one should be allowed to just take people&rsquo;s works. Finally, when somebody makes something with AI they should have to disclose the fact they used AI, and which AI model they used.
