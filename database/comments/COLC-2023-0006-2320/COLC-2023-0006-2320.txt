Good day! It is my sincerely held belief that works produced by artificial intelligence cannot and should not be protected by copyright. AI is not creating new ideas or art, it is mathematically aggregating the works of many individuals. Nothing that is produced by AI can be new or unique; AI is only parroting the original works of others. AI exists in defiance of copyright, and should not be protected by it. Thank you!
