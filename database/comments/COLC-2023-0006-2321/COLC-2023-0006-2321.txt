As an artist on the Internet, it is not uncommon for my artwork to be stolen and used without permission. I know of friends who have had their work stolen and used commercially, which is an obvious breach of copyright laws.<br/>These AI datasets do this on a massive scale. Without asking permission or asking for a license, the people who train generative AI scrape massive amounts of copyrighted work in order to generate cloned, &quot;frankenstein&quot; images for profit. Unlike collage, which is a legitimate art form, AI work is completely recognizable as a copy of its original stolen parts&mdash;this is in fact lauded and seen as a good thing by its supporters.<br/>It must be an opt-in system to have one&#39;s work put into an AI dataset. If the system is opt-out, it is going to be exactly the same as right now, because artists of any size without the legal team of a corporation have no way to chase down the tens of hundreds of AI models that might steal from them. In fact, I can imagine a scenario where an artist politely messages a person to opt-out, and then that person maliciously goads their friends to begin stealing on a bigger scale, thus requiring more messages. This type of occurrence is very common on the Internet.<br/>With an opt-in system, artists should also be able to earn royalties from the use of their artwork, especially if it appears in a commercial setting. There is no reason why the original artist, whom sometimes an entire dataset is trained on, should see absolutely zero of the income of the dataset produced explicitly from their copyrighted work. Additionally, it should be legally always made explicit and clear who is opted in and who is not.<br/>Thus, AI systems should be considered &quot;reproduction/redistribution of work&quot;, which requires a copyright license by third parties. This would mean that the copyright of the produced images will depend on the given license by the original artist. Therefore the fault of not infringing copyright must lie on the producers of the system: The user who puts the original images into the system, not the user who enters in prompts. Writing prompts should not be protected under copyright. The prompts are exactly like an order at a restaurant: It is not copyrightable artwork to say &quot;I would like a pasta alfredo with shrimp&quot; to the waiter.<br/>As it currently stands, AI in the field of generative images is rife with theft and deeply harmful to both small and large-scale artists because of this. <br/><br/>Additionally, the field of voice acting and general acting is impacted as well. Without permission, samples of a person&#39;s voice or likeness&mdash;stolen from often times copyrighted media such as film and videos&mdash;are fed into an AI dataset and used to generate content. These are often used for malicious purposes and are extremely violating both in a psychological sense and a legal rights sense. It is known that AI voice is already pushing actors out of work. Therefore, it should be regulated that each person is legally entitled to their own voice and likeness. This regulation has not been needed in the past, but it is now necessary to define. An AI generator created from one or more actors must require an explicit copyright license from all involved actors before proceeding to be produced and used, even in a non-commerical setting. If AI is permitted to be used in a product such as a film or game, this should be a separated from the agreement to lend one&#39;s work to the product; An actor who agrees to act in a film should be able to refuse or allow the film to use AI of their likeness separately. Additionally, this means that deceased actors&#39; likenesses should be owned by their estate. This makes them able to enter public domain after death.<br/><br/>I am thankful for the opportunity to comment on this matter. I expect decisive and reasonable action to protect our rights.
