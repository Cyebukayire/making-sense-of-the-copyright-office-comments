As an aspiring artist, I find the lack of regulations surrounding AI works to be alarming. AI and its users have been allowed to scrape the internet with almost no restriction and take any work they choose, use it, and provide no credit or compensation to the original creator. This is most pertinent with the rise of text-making programs like ChatGPT, but also with programs that copy visual artists and voice actors like Dall E and Cover.ai respectively. AI makes it so companies that are unwilling to pay artists for their work can STILL use the work of said artists because the AI has the capability to replicate their style. AI, as it stands now, negates the necessity for creatives, and undermines the importance of artistic love and effort in favor of soulless quick, easy results. That said, it has the potential to provide artists of all kind with the ability to create in ways unparalleled to anything we&#39;ve ever seen. We just need regulations that ensure artists&#39; consent, compensation, ensured job security, and proper flagging of AI material.  <br/>-ET
