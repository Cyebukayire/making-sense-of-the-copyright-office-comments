Generative AI should not be able to be copyrighted. The engines these are built from utilize unethical scraping of data, and imagery used to &quot;teach&quot; these programs are done without consent or compensation to the original artist. This poses a threat to hundreds of thousands of people&#39;s livelihood and well-being. More protections should be created for the original creators of the art, and not lines of code trying to replicate and replace them.
