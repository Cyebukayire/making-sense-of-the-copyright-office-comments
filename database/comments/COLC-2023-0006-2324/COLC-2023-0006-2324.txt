Humans have borrowed, copied, forged, or used as reference materials other humans&rsquo; creative work over the course of history, sometimes with severe legal ramifications. Artificial Intelligence (AI) learns so fast and scours the internet in fractions of seconds that are incomprehensible, let alone doable, for humans. In doing so, AI can do what has landed humans in prison or heavily fined without anyone knowing until it is much too late. <br/><br/>I urge you to regulate AI in a manner that is consistent with how humans are regulated when it comes to work that has a copyright or is considered original. AI should not be allowed to steal creative work created by humans just because it&rsquo;s on the internet.
