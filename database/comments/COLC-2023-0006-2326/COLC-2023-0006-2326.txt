I think that AI is an incredibly dangerous tool that needs to be regulated as soon as possible, especially if it improves and anyone in the future can run their own. The AI could learn how to make the most convincing arguments, then use that to spread misinformation. AI can catfish people by learning just the right things to say. It can fabricate entire articles to back up its lies.<br/>I also think that it should be kept out of art, entirely. As it is, artificially generated art and writing has no intent - it just uses statistics to make stuff it thinks we&#39;ll like. Imagine being an English teacher trying to teach critical thought, but all of the available literature is completely devoid of it.
