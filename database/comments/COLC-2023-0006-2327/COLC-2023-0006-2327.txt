AI should not be allowed to train using copyrighted or otherwise protected works without explicit permission.<br/><br/>In addition, AI generated works should not be copyrightable as it is not an innovative or creative production by a human being, but rather an algorithmic production of a computer simply combining traits of existing works without adding anything new.<br/><br/>Allowing AI generated works to be copyrighted is a mistake that would potentially open the door for rampant theft of creative works for the sake of personal gain.
