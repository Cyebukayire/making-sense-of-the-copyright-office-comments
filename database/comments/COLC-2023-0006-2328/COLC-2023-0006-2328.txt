AI trained on the works of others must not be eligible for copyright. Only in the instance that an AI is trained by a single individual&#39;s works should that individual be able to claim copyright on work produced by that AI. If an AI is trained on the works of others, they must either share in the ownership of copyright, or the resulting work must be ineligible for copyright. AI generated content trained on generally available and unspecific information from the internet (visual, textual, or otherwise) should be automatically put into public domain, as the public has provided the training for the AI.
