I guess the big problem here is the idea that people own information. Giving people property rights over audio, video, and words has and always been a bandaid meant to foster the production of the arts. While you could argue that entertainment based information is not vital to the success of our country, it is also the lifeblood of our culture, so it should be protected. However, the future is here: with the help of artificial intelligence, any media can be generated by anyone anytime. We have reached (will soon reach) media post-scarcity. Even if the government tries to stop people from creating ai media, they will do it from the privacy of their own homes. The real question is, should this be publicly derided or not? I don&#39;t think so. Artificial intelligence will help everyone do everything. Please support it in any way possible. It&#39;s good for society as a whole.
