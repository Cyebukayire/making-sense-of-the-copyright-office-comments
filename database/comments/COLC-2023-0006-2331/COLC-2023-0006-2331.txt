AI actively degrades the results of search queries, flooding search engines with shoddy information. It does not make art without training it on other art, often training on internet artists who are licensing their works to media websites to share the art with others. They are not sharing it for someone to train an AI to recreate their work mashed together with other artists to obfuscate this theft. AI does have some use; for example Joel Haver on Youtube uses it to help with a process of animation, where he&#39;ll make keyframes of animation over a live action shot and have a program help with the inbetweens. All of this is done on his own creative work. It does not source from other creatives.
