Products created by Artificial Intelligence should not be considered eligible for copyright. AI can only create in the first place because it is a program was that was fed data that came from the time, talent, and work of actual living, breathing humans-- and that was likely done without the human creator&#39;s consent. Any creativity displayed by AI is only because it was programmed, or fed, information from any given database created by humans. AI is not a person, is not capable of true thought, feeling, or creativity, and is not capable of free-thinking, spontaneous creation.<br/><br/>I repeat, AI works do not deserve to be copyrighted.
