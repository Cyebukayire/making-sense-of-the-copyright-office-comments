Since the majority of my expertise comes from working with machine learning and determining training samples, I will focus on these issues. In my experience (and from what I&#39;ve read in the literature available for particle physics and their training models), a machine learning algorithm (AI is basically just a collection of machine learning algorithms) is only as good as its training sample. Different training samples can result in vastly different outcomes. In terms of my work, this results in the correct or incorrect classification, which can vary from about 50% to 90% accuracy depending on the training sample.<br/><br/>In the case of many AI algorithms discussed here, the training sample is acquired from copyrighted materials, which heavily impacts the outcome. If the training sample is changed, then the outcome is entirely different. Because these AI would be unable to produce the same results without using others&#39; work without permission, I believe that the AI should be considered theft.<br/><br/>In fact, the other day, I saw someone who commissioned a piece of art, and it turned out to be AI art. This was a 500$ purchase from this person and that money no longer went to the artists who made the AI art possible. Already, there&#39;s clearly a negative financial effect on the artists whose work was stolen to make the AI algorithm work to a high level of success.
