I am opposed to Artificial Intelligence being given copyright to any material created from its use. The training of AI has involved stealing the copyright and work of real humans in order for it to create. In this instance, there is no work from AI to copyright. In my opinion, it actually violates copyright laws and intellectual property of the people whose works the AI &ldquo;trains&rdquo; on. As someone who writes, I am concerned with the use of AI specifically in the arts. Art cannot be recreated by AI; it possesses no emotions or creativity with which to write, draw, compose, etc. It will only ever steal from existing works and piece together what it is programmed to think might work. AI can be useful in many fields, but this is not one of them. It is also dangerous territory when it comes to AI mimicking real people. While this may not conflict with copyright laws, it most definitely interferes with state laws and privacy laws. Allowing AI to be given copyright for the work it produces is unnecessary and shameful to the people who have spent their lives working hard at something that AI can sloppily mash together in seconds. There is no value to the work created by AI.
