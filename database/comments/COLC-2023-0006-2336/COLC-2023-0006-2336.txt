6.3: Writing from a technical perspective, while AI inputs are proprietary, it is generally assumed that all text-based models use Project Gutenberg as one input, as it has a vast number of public domain long-form works. The reason they use copyrighted works as well has less to do with a desire to flaunt the law, and more to do with the vast size of the input needed to train an AI. I believe that if it was possible to train an AI on purely public domain and/or licensed works, that this would be accepted practice.<br/><br/>So, my suggestion is that the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 be rescinded. This would change the length of copyright from 95 years back down to 75, immediately putting a vast number of works into the public domain. While this, by itself, doesn&#39;t put those works into a form usable to train AIs, it does make it possible to do so legally, and without damaging copyright as a concept or generating bad press. This would not be sufficient by itself, but I believe it would be a significant step in the right direction.
