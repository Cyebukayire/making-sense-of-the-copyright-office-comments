<br/>Thank you for the request for public comment on this important and rapidly developing subject. I am a writer who is passionate about the welfare of other artists and believe their exclusive rights to their art should be protected.<br/><br/>The Copyright Act outlines when an author has exclusive rights to their work and places time limits on those exclusive rights. I graduated with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in English Literature and benefited from the many literary works in the public domain whose authors were long since deceased. <br/><br/>Training generative AI on those materials is fair. On the other hand, training generative AI on materials that are currently under copyright, whose authors are living and still able to profit off their copyright protected work, is a violation of these author&rsquo;s exclusive rights. <br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that training generative AI on copyrighted material without the author&rsquo;s consent violates the Copyright Act. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.
