As an artist I work to create my pieces by hand in traditional methods. My work features human figures which means I hire models for my art and do sketches. I don&#39;t copy from someone else&#39;s photos. The placement of the models is my work, the sketches are mine from my work, the final art piece is from the sketches from my work with models. AI can take any photo I&#39;ve posted to show off my art online (how I get art sold), it steals my art, learns my art, and then invents versions of my art. That&#39;s copyright infringement. Works created totally by AI is work based on theft. Creating works that so mimic an artist to the point of impersonating them is dangerous. I do not support AI works being able to seek copyright.
