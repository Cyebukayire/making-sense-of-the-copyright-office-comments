See attached file(s)<br/><br/>S.A.F.E. | A.I.<br/>STRUCTURED APPROACHES FOR FAIR AND ETHICAL A.I. APPLICATIONS<br/><br/>My team and I, over the past several months have put together a conceptual framework which suggests a technological solution to the misapplication of Generative AI systems, and subsequent mass intellectual property theft.<br/><br/>Having spoken extensively with numerous Congressional offices, the Copyright and Trademark office, the Federal Trade Commission, Congressional witnesses called upon for their expertise in licensing and the nature of Generative A.I., and Dr. Phil, we are happy to share this attached document which posits a technological approach to protecting intellectual property.
