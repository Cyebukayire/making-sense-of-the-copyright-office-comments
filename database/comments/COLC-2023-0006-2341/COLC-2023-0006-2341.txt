AI-generated images, writing, or other forms of media should not be eligible for copyright. The technology is based on non-consensual scraping of images, art, and more from the internet, including sites with for-profit, copyrighted materials. These models are trained on other people&rsquo;s work without compensation or active consent. Furthermore, precedent already exists that says works that are the product of nature, animals, or plants cannot be copyrighted, which leaves only work created by humans. AI is not human. It isn&rsquo;t sentient. Only human works should be copyrightable.
