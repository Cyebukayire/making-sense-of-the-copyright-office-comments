I do not think that AI generated works should be covered under copyright. I do not think that playing fill in the blanks with a machine shows intellectual ownership of the end result. <br/><br/>AI generation is a procedure. This procedure can have a multitude of purposes, and some of these purposes are useful. Notably, it has been used to good effect for the evaluation and improvement of complicated systems such as drug interactions and environmental efforts. But even in these cases, it does not create new ideas; it compares what it knows about existing impacts of existing ideas to arrive at a solution. It is a very good optimizer, when given existing data.<br/><br/>Similarly, when AI is used to create an image, or text, it pulls from existing information--existing art--to optimize a solution. It directly references this existing art. If it has only a few pieces of art to draw from, the lack of variation between the existing art and the AI generated result is blatant. However, with the Internet, it is easy to provide the AI tool with a large body of work to draw from without the consent of the original artists. Currently, controls do not exist to protect original, copyrighted works from being used to inform the machine. <br/><br/>Despite the language used to describe it, the machine does not think. It is my opinion that without intention behind the use of the existing works, this does not constitute true transformation. As AI generated works can currently be sold the same way that the art it is derived from is sold, it directly harms the markets that the art it is derived from is in. Without regulation, I believe that AI generated works are harmful to existing copyrighted works.
