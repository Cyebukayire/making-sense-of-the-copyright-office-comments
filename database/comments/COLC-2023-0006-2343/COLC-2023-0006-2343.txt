There is a great need for regulation on Artificial Intelligence. When considering any technology that could potentially create legal issues in the present or future, it&#39;s important that we act quickly. AI infringes on the copyrights of the work of artists, writers, actors, and many other creative professions. I, and many others, are deeply concerned about the impacts of AI on creative industries, job employment, and our culture&#39;s artistic future. AI has also heightened the spread of misinformation due to its misinterpretation of digital sources. I believe there should be fairly tight regulations on AI, prohibiting it&#39;s usage of copyrighted work without the explicit consent of the creator and mandating the implementation of fact-checking or disclaimers for inaccuracy.
