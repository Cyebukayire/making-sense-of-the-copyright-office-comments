Hello,<br/><br/>I have a few concerns about Artificial Intelligence and how it interacts with copyright.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I am concerned that AI can be used to make a profit without compensating the creators of the data it trained off of. I believe that considering AI&#39;s output aims to directly compete with this training data, it is unfair to not compensate the original authors - let alone ensure their permission before using their data in this way.<br/><br/>I am also concerned about machine generation and its ability to replicate existing copyrighted materials. Considering machine-generation aims to train for and replicate the most common existing patterns, this means it is extremely likely AI output will end up plagiarizing its input.<br/><br/>Overall, I would advocate for stronger regulation regarding how AI can gather its training data, along with properly defining AI generated pieces and their role in the context of copyright infringement. I would also like distinctions to be made regarding the commercial vs. non-commercial use of AI.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Warm Regards,<br/>Concerned Anonymous Citizen
