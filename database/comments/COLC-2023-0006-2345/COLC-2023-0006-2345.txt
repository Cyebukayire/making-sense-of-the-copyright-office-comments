There is a misconception that has been brought to the forefront in marketing &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; it creates ideas of us making a person that deftly makes decisions and creates on its own. That we might ask &quot;rainy day in September&quot; and it draws upon hundreds of other artists seeing how the rain in September affected them and creating a unique piece. This is a lie, when something is submitted it searches throughout and finds a piece or several pieces and cuts pieces warping the image until it feels it has approximated vaguely what was asked of it. We do not allow copyrighting forgery and it seems an ill decision to start. This is not artificial intelligence this is an algorithm <br/><br/>Furthermore we look to this technology as a brand new innovation that will dramatically change the field and in a way its correct. It will be used to threaten the livelihood of all artists why would we ask for a critical eye and passionate worker when we can simply take their work without their permission and random generate something that approximates what they&#39;re after. Artificially generated &quot;art&quot; will allow artist&#39;s own passions be used against them to belittle their work and copyrighting it will make their work all the more difficult. You ask if Artificial art should be something you can copyright, I must ask what good can this ever serve artists.<br/><br/>Over the last year or so I&#39;ve questioned many on the use of AI Art what it does as a tool in service to artists. Some have made suggestions as reference, as a quick background or to fill in the gaps. Artists don&#39;t do this because we can do it quickly we don&#39;t do it because its easy, we make art not for profit but for life to make a bit of our soul one with the universe. Be sensible and help be the change we need in the world.
