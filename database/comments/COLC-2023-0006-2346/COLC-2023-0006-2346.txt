Thank you for this opportunity, my main concern is the use of copyrighted material to train these models, in my opinion, this should be regulated, some say it should be considered a transformative work, but it represents a very important part on the AI process of generation, and it is posible to show very obvious copyrighted material on the end result, a very common example could show if you try to generate &quot;animated mouse&quot; the information on wich the AI was trained, will generate something very similar to Disney&#39;s mascot.<br/><br/>Some people would defend the Ai as something similar to a human learning from the information that it is trained on, when this could not be farther from the truth, what an Ai does is search for patterns and suggestions, like some webs use to try to complete the most popular options with, an Ai does this thousands of times, and presents a random result that has the characteristics that was asked for, it doesn&#39;t think, it can&#39;t really learn, it is just a very impressive and complex algorithm.<br/><br/>I want to end this message with a personal note. The Ais, a thecnology with so much potential that could help humanity achieve great things and solve some of world&#39;s greatest problems, is being used to draw and write. This feels like a waste and an insult, not just to the creatives everywhere, but to the whole world. I sincerely hope this message helps to bring some much needed hope in these times, again, thank you for this opportunity.
