I believe AI artwork should not be protected under copyright. The use of technology when creating art requires inputting images not made by the programmer to feed the program a prompt, thus violating existing copyright law by stealing the work of others without proper permission or compensated pay. This affects my field of work, as I am an artist, and could result in strangers stealing my work, and potentially steal my job, based on an image or two of my art that I gave no consent for them to use. I hope you consider the livelihood of individuals who are in my shoes who may work in a similar field, and consider protecting our rights to protect our art by not allowing AI art to be protected under copyright, so these programs and their programmers don&#39;t make a living by stealing our decades worth of hard work and practice just for them to take it from us and slap their own lable onto it and call it their own.
