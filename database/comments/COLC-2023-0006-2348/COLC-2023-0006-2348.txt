I&#39;m not terrified of AI like some others. That said, there should be regulation that determines how it&#39;s used. The potential for harm is great with AI&#39;s ability to mimic real life individuals (or humans in general). This can lead to false information being disseminated to the public, thus increasing the ability of those in &quot;power&quot; to manipulate the rest of us. This can be done through advertising, political agendas, and disinformation campaigns. Unfortunately, by the time the FCC (or your office) gets around to regulating, it may be too late. You don&#39;t release a wild beast with unknown potential for good OR bad out loose in the general public without first determining its attributes. Please take the necessary steps to curb bad actors from utilizing this new technology for their own evil purposes.
