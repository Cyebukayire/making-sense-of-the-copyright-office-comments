Hello and congratulations on the initiative of opening a public hearing on this topic. I&#39;m an author who uses AI in various ways, for research, brainstorming, writing, translating and illustrating my work. I fully agree with the views in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC3LLf8LG3w&amp;t=628s<br/>Basically, if the author directly influences the generative AI tool, I believe this should be copywritable and considered essentially that author&#39;s or artist&#39;s work.<br/>Currently, AI tools could conceivable start writing text or producing art on their own. However, the vast majority of authors like myself have to PROMPT the AI to create. The prompting process is actually a creative and directive process, and it is here that the personal input of the author is provided.<br/>Therefore, I feel strongly that my creations in which I spent long weeks researching, prompting, revising, editing and putting together my work, are personally created by me (with the help of an AI Assistant - for which, by the way, I am paying, the same way I could pay a ghost writer or an illustrator) and I can claim copywrite over it.<br/>Thanks for giving me the opportunity to express my views on this.
