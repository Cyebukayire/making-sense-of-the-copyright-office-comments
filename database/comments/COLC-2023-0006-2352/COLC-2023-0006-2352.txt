I believe that artificial intelligence should not be allowed to be trained on people&#39;s original works. I think that unless the creator explicitly gives their individual consent then using their work like this is wrong. I believe laws should be enacted to protect artists of all kinds. Like graphic artists who now have their work appropriated for image generators. Independent writers create stories that can be hundreds of thousands of words long only for a chatbot to gather massive amounts of data from their work without authorization. I think AI is both a powerful tool for mankind and a great threat to our creativity. We can solve this issue by regulating AI and protecting human creators.
