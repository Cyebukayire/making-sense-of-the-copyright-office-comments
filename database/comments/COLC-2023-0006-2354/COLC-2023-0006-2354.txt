Generative AI can be used to create the structure of a story, iron out messy details, create character attributes, edit the work, and compare your own work to the set of rules you have established for the story or the character.  All of that still allows an author to do their own writing.  Frankly, that approach can strengthen any writing by focusing on quality.  The content generated by AI starts as a rough draft and requires significant editing to adhere to an author&#39;s vision and expectations.  Just publishing from an AI-first draft will demonstrate an author lacks talent and skill.  The attached file is entirely generated by AI without any editing as a proof of concept that AI work is low quality.  AI cannot, at this time, create a true literary product that rivals human work, but that will change.
