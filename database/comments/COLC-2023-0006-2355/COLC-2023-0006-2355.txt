Artificial intelligence has greatly decreased the ability of readers on the internet to find useful sources. Many times when they type a simple question into a browsing engine, they&rsquo;ll find numerous AI-generated articles with nonsensical, incorrect information before finding any information of actual use, if they even scroll that far. It&rsquo;s far too easy for people to take AI-generated advice as fact instead of what it really is: words taken from across the internet, tossed into a blender, and spitting out the &ldquo;best&rdquo; result.
