I am an artist, musician, composer, fiction writer and fanwriter with a significant amount of work in assorted places across the internet. I really resent AI because I&#39;m fairly sure it has been trained using my work without my knowledge, consent, or any way to prevent it happening. <br/><br/>This makes me angry, and I have decided to keep most of my music making offline because I think AI is going to wreck a lot of things and I don&#39;t want to help it. It&#39;s too late for that with regard to my art and writing, and there&#39;s nowhere else I can really post fanfiction than the internet so it&#39;s post it and assume it will be used by AI or stop sharing my fanwriting. I am also trying to avoid supporting AI-produced materials where I know that&#39;s what they are.<br/><br/>I want a way to stop my work being used to train AI without my knowledge or consent. I also want labelling on AI-produced products so everyone knows what they are dealing with.
