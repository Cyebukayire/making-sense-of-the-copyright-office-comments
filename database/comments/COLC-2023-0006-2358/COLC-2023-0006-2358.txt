I believe that permission from a copyright owner should not be required, as long as the manufacturers of the AI don&#39;t take personal credit for the material.  If it ends up that permission is needed, it should be written, either electronically or on paper.  Compensation is necessary if an entity were to violate any restrictions. <br/><br/>Materials generated using AI should not be considered copyrightable, even if there&#39;s human involvement. <br/><br/>In the event that Human-like AI impersonates a real individual, as in seriously claiming to be that person, and causes defamation that person should be allowed to pursue legal action against the creator.  As with things such as artistic styles, should not be protected under copyright law, unless the individual is claiming to be someone else.
