As a writer, I&rsquo;ve recently discovered generative artificial intelligence (AI) programs such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Midjourney. I&rsquo;ve played around with them and consider them just another tool to use. All three of the programs I mentioned require human interaction. Photoshop, grammar checking tools, and even search engines use AI.<br/>Just as humans look at pictures and read books to draw inspiration, it seems that AI does the same thing, except thousands of times faster.<br/>As far as books are concerned, as a reader, I don&rsquo;t care who created it, human or AI, as long as I like it. Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll have a favorite AI author, but that&rsquo;s not today. All AI I&rsquo;ve seen require humans to make it work.<br/>Conclusion: There should be few restrictions on generative artificial intelligence and the copyright of those works should belong to the human.<br/>Connie Myres<br/>Author
