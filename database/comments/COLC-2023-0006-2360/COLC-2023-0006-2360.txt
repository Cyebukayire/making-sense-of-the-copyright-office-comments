I believe AI Generated text should be copyrighted, if the author/human, updated the promts, text, and/or made changes. I look at AI Generated text as material - much like a carpenter or sculptor would carve a piece of wood or marble. If the creator just enters one AI prompt and doesn&#39;t make any changes or revisions whatsoever, then it would be like the carpenter or sculptor saying their slab of stone or block of wood is art and should be copyrighted. <br/>However, if any human work was involved in crafting, editing, revising, changing the AI content either by additional prompting and/or editing, etc. then in my opinion, it should be able to be copyrighted.  <br/>I&#39;ve spent ten hours a day for 1-4 days on fixing AI Generated content of one chapter or half a chapter. It would take me much less time to just write the chapter myself, but I like having the AI more as a co-writing partner and seeing what it can come up with. But I have never, in my experience, been able to take the AI Generated text and use as is. I do heavy editing, revising and updating.
