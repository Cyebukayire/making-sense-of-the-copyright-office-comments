I wish copyright as a whole was less restrictive. There are so many wonderful stories being told as fan fictions and its a same that writers can&#39;t get paid because of how long the copyright lasts. If there was a way to put together a royalty share requirement for publishing something like a Harry potter book et al then that would be nice! AI is giving us a chance to rethink copyright as a whole in the U.S.
