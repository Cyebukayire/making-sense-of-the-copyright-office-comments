The first problem with this whole endeavor is using the wrong terminology that obfuscates the truth of the matter, when talking about these tools. &#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39; should be dropped, and only the term &#39;generative&#39; should be used instead. The creators of these tools want people to use the designation &#39;AI&#39; to make these things seem like they have intelligence. They do not. They are no different than anything else a computer has ever been designed to do. These models take in input and then provide an output, based on the algorithms and processes that it was programmed with. Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, etc. do not have any inherent autonomy, and thus are not intelligent. These tools only generate things when a human being, with intelligence and autonomy, seeks them out and uses them. Thus, &#39;generative&#39; is a far better description, and it should be adopted, to help fight that obfuscation and allow the office to make these decisions from a place of truth, rather than forging ahead with a dangerous understanding.<br/><br/>Second, any regulations that the US Copyright Office makes, regarding these generative tools, should take that fact that they are tools to be used by humans, into account, no different than a hammer or a paint brush or a smartphone. And just like a hammer or a paint brush or a smartphone, humans can choose to use these generative tools for good or ill. A hammer can be used to build a chair, and it can be used to attack another human being. A paintbrush can be used to depict a gorgeous sunset or to protest a war by creating a horrifying abstract depiction of the violence caused. It can also create slanderous depictions of another human being or be used to copy another&#39;s work to scam others. A smartphone can be used to keep oneself connected to others and expand access to knowledge. It can also be used as a tool in many illegal acts, including the creation and distribution of CSAM. Yet we do not ban or regulate hammers, paintbrushes, and smartphones, on their capacity to be used in acts of societal harm. This principal should also apply to anything that the US Copyright Office, or any other government institution in the US do, looking at these generative technologies.<br/><br/>Third, the principals of fair use should not be harmed, lessened, or restricted by any regulation that the US Copyright Office introduces regarding these tools. Copyright, in the US and abroad, is in need of deep reform, but one of the things that keeps our dilapidated system from falling apart, is the doctrine of fair use. As vague as a concept as it is, the fact that it exists, makes copyright still somewhat work and its existence keeps our culture somewhat healthy. My thoughts on this are likely much broader than the office&#39;s specific call for comments on this issue, so I will come back to the point. The manner and methods that the generative tools were made should be regarded as &#39;fair use&#39;. <br/><br/>Fourth, artistic styles and trends cannot, and should not ever be, subject to copyright. This is a point I have heard bandied about, from aggrieved creators, and I want to state, emphatically, that is a dire action to even consider, much less put into effect. I think of patent law, and how much control that companies have over innovation in pharmaceuticals, food production, and software development, thanks to how poorly constructed those particular laws and regulations are. Patent trolls, legal entities that acquire patents and then sit on them, seek to bully others into giving them money, thanks to that broken system. Creating a &#39;copyright of style&#39;, the same thing would happen. &#39;Style trolls&#39; would corner an artistic trend and then move to extort payment from smaller creators for happening to craft similar looking but distinct work. The US Copyright Office should not entertain any regulatory path that would create such a &#39;copyright of style&#39;.<br/><br/>Finally, and more broadly, the US Copyright Office should be guided by a more human and empathetic understanding of these issues. You don&#39;t have to go far back in history to stumble upon how copyright and a new technology clashed, highlighting the need for reform. The internet presented all of the same issues - easy of sharing, simulated depictions of real people, data privacy - that generative tech is presenting now, and none of these issues have effectively been dealt with by our government. This is all to say, if regulation had caught up to the internet twenty or thirty years ago, then the office wouldn&#39;t have to be fielding comments on this issue right now. And just like the internet, these new generative technologies have the ability to expand our culture and people&#39;s access to, and participation in, that culture.<br/><br/>Copyright exists to support and sustain culture, not the other way around. Expanding culture and access to it has always enriched our society and been key in the success of our country. It would behoove the US Copyright Office to act accordingly, with this guiding principal in mind.
