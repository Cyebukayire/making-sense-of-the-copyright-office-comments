Using generative AI tools by any human author in creating artistic works such as painting, sculpting, books, movies, etc. should be able to be copyrighted by that human author.  <br/><br/>The newest tools recently introduced in the last year, such as CHATGPT, CLAUDE, BARD, MIDJOURNEY, ARTSMARTAI, etc., all require the intervention of a human to create an end product.  Without a human&rsquo;s intervention (prompting, instructions, modification) the AI tool would create nothing.  AI is a tool just like many other tools that digital creators currently use, such as MS Word, Photoshop, Grammarly, ProWritingAid, AUTOCAD, and many others.  These programs presently have an AI in use for certain functions within those programs, and some have for many years.<br/><br/>Without human interaction, being the catalyst for all of these tools, art, in all forms, would never be created.  It takes the ideas of a human mind to create, even with all the various AI tools that are now available.<br/><br/>Large Language Models (LLMs) train on publicly available data found throughout the internet.  There&rsquo;s a reason that artistic style is not copyrightable.  Style is taught to humans in the classroom when they study the various &lsquo;art&rsquo; types (painting, writing, music, etc.).  Humans, before they become &lsquo;individual creators&rsquo; learn various styles of current and past artists, and then attempt to mimic and change those styles to create a personal style that they are individually comfortable with.  Because of this, not one person&rsquo;s artistic style can be totally mimicked by another human being, because each individual&rsquo;s style is influenced by many personal factors.  The only person who writes in the exact style of Stephen King &ndash; is Stephen King.  The only person who paints in the exact style of Picasso &ndash; is Picasso.<br/><br/>This is not a tough concept.  If a human artist is using a tool (AI, paintbrush, word processor, spell checker, etc.) to create something, they should be able to Copyright the end product, because without the human artist using the tool, the end product would never have been created.<br/><br/>If AI ever becomes sentient enough to self-generate an art form, and no longer needs a human artist to create a unique end product (either by guiding/prompting/instructing/modifying/editing. Etc.), then Copyright should NOT be granted to the AI.<br/><br/>An AI is not human, and Copyright should be reserved to humans only, as Copyright is used in protecting an individual&rsquo;s intellectual property.  AI is another tool to be used by humans in creating something &ndash; whether it is a type of creative art or something else.  Without humans, AI tools would not exist.  <br/><br/>No matter how sentient, AI will never be human and should never have the same rights or protections as a human being.  They are only machine tools to be used by humans.<br/><br/>In the case of mimicking individual human voices or their likenesses (voice artists, actor&rsquo;s voices, or their images):  a song or a show where the listeners/viewers CAN NOT tell the difference between human or AI is another matter entirely.  <br/><br/>If a company produces a show/movie/speech/commercial/song, etc., with AI to deceive the end user into thinking that a particular artist or actor is the person acting/singing/performing something/anything, that should never be copyrightable.  In fact, that company should be held liable to the artist for damages.  <br/><br/>Each individual should own their own image!  Voice prints are as unique as fingerprints are!<br/><br/>Also, if a company, or another individual, uses an AI tool to mimic an artist&rsquo;s image or voice, this would be intentional and should be punished in the most extreme way, not just with fines, but jail time, too.  Because in order for the AI to mimic someone in such a manner, a human would have to be behind the instructions given to the AI.
