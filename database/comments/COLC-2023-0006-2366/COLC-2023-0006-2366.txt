In short: Not a single piece of AI work should be copyrighted.<br/><br/>AI technology is literally stealing all the possible pieces of art and writing that the scraping systems can find. The worst cases are those where artists finds their style mimicked. A person writing a few words as a prompt isn&#39;t artistic expression. I&#39;ve even seen people complain how to &#39;simplify&#39; the prompt writing not to always &#39;having to type all the necessary words&#39;. AI is a literal mockery to artists and writers who have taken the time to learn the craft to produce authentic art.<br/><br/>AI is only good as a visual sketch or a written prompt for an idea. As a tool, not a means to and end. The purpose of this is that the artist / writer will do the piece from scratch themselves that is only based off of what the AI generated.<br/><br/>AI made piece of art that is just slightly altered by the artist themselves, for example fixing erroneous hands, or other small awkward details AI cannot do properly, should also not be copyrighted. The line where it&#39;s AI made, and where it&#39;s touched by human to fix mentioned errors, is blurry, thus it should be strictly ruled against AI usage even in such cases.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my short comment.
