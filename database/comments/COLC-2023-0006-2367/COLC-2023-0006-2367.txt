Thank you sincerely for opening this issue up for a public and wide discourse.<br/><br/>I believe the most equitable and long-term economically productive way to address copyright in AI is to only allow AI-based works to be copyrightable when they are accompanied by a complete record of the previously copyrighted works that were referenced and used in the training of the AI producing the work.  In other words, AI models that are based in whole or in part on copyrighted works must retain said copyright (licensing) information in association with each and every individual weight or measure, such that when a new work is created it is possible to produce a ledger that contains the entire history of all weights referenced to produce the new work.  Such a ledger much accompany the digital format of the new work and can be accomplished via blockchain technology.  In this way the new work could be copyrighted by the new creator, but with a licensing debt characterized by potentially thousands of micro-license references each of which stipulate a proportional allocation of revenue generated from the sale of the new copyrighted work that is due to the original copyright holders responsible for the materials used to train the AI and produce the new work.  This may seem like a record keeping task of overwhelming complexity, but it is in fact doable with the AI technology itself and simply requires the producers of AI tools to comply with this ledger keeping functionality in order to produce tools suitable for commercial production.  Finally, in the spirit of attempting to slow down the advance of AI technologies while lawmakers and society attempt to catch up, there is nothing wrong in asking AI tool producers to put in the extra effort of ensuring that their systems properly reward the original human creators from which their tools ultimately draw all of their power.
