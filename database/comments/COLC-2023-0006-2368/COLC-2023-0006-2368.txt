Anything published and under a copyright should not be allowed to be fed into an Artificial Intelligence (AI) program, not for training purposes nor for beta testing. Copyrights have historically been held to a degree where individuals have been given cease and desist orders, if not sued, for creating fanworks based off copyrighted content. If AI programs are allowed to use the exact same works in order to feed an algorithm, then it should render all copyrights null and void. Otherwise it setting the tone that AI have more legal rights than human beings. Furthermore, there is no protection alloted for theft of work by third party individuals who then upload copyrighted content nor original works that&#39;re unpublished to AI programs.<br/><br/>There is nothing in place to protect creators, or companies with proprietary information not available to the public, to feed this stolen work into an AI program and thus making it public. This is not only a violation of copyright law, theft of content, but has the potential for national security concerns. What is stopping a whistle blower or disgruntled individual from uploading sensitive or classified documentation into an AI program? Programs owned and operated by companies who have written it into their terms and conditions that all content uploaded is now their property?<br/><br/>AI programs should not be allowed access to any content not created specifically for the use of training AI. Much like educational programs use textbooks specifically written for learning purposes.
