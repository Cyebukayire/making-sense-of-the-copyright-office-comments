As an author testing out how AI can help me with my writing, I think it is outrageous that there needs to be a distinction between what is written by the author and what is written by an AI. If I&#39;ve done my job correctly as a writer, I shouldn&#39;t be able to pull out any passages of AI writing that don&#39;t have my stamp on them. The idea that prompts are not copyrightable is also bogus. It takes a lot of effort to create a good prompt, one that has all the information I&#39;ve created about my story, chracters, style, world-building, and a whole host of other story related input. I have prompts that are in excess of 8000 words. Are you telling me that the copyright office doesn&#39;t think any of MY WORDS when creating that prompt are not subject to copyright? I created it. I wrote that prompt. An 8000 word prompt takes days and sometimes weeks to flesh out. What happened to the idea that my words are copyrighted from the day I set them down on the page? Is the fact I am using my words as a prompt for an AI model to use make it no longer my work? That sure doesn&#39;t give me much faith in the copyright office. <br/><br/>I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m a small independent author who doesn&#39;t submit my work for copyright privileges. It don&#39;t see the advantages of submitting for copyright when I&#39;m not in a stage in my career that I can use the legal system for any infringement on my work. However, I can see a day when that will change. The idea that anything I created with the assistance of AI won&#39;t be copyrightable is not an outrage considering how pervasive the technology is sure to become. It is already built into search engines now. Independent authors are using it and testing the limits of what we can do with it and how it can help us create better books. However, the copyright office is slapping us in the face when it says that all the work we put into pre-planning a written work, whether fiction or non-fiction, becomes noncopyrightable as soon as we use it for a prompt into a generative AI does not make sense.<br/><br/>If after we generate text based on that same prompt that could be more than 8000 words, we still can&#39;t copyright the output even if we edit that output then I think your office needs to sit down and take a look at the process of creating a good story in more detail. It&#39;s like none of you know how to create a work of fiction using the AI models out there. Have any of you even tried to write a piece of fiction using an AI? Have you taken the time to create a well thought out, highly detailed prompt to use to generate a story? If not, then I think you need to take the time to do so before stating cart blanch that no AI generated text can be copyrighted. Because you are wrong and highly mistaken in thinking that just because an AI helped write the text that nothing of the author is in those words. Because if I&#39;ve done my job correctly as an author, you can&#39;t take me out of those words.
