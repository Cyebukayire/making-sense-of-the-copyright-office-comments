I&#39;m a fiction writer. As I type this, ProWritingAid is using AI to instantly check ( It just suggested I consider removing this split infinitive. Not gonna do it.) my spelling and grammar. It&#39;s a tool that helps me get my work done more quickly (and with fewer complaints). <br/><br/>In playing with LLM&#39;s I&#39;ve found the prose produced by AIs like GPT 4 and Claude 2 leave a LOT to be desired. But that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re useless. They just require a lot of work on my part. I&#39;m the one who comes up with the story. I&#39;m the one lays out the plot and character arcs. And I&#39;m the one who does all the editing and the seemingly endless rewriting. Again, these LLMs are just another tool to help me create quality work more quickly. It&#39;s not--make a prompt, push a button, and magically a best-selling novel appears! That&#39;s a fantasy way too many people believe.<br/><br/>This kind of synthetic computer power may be new to writing, but it&#39;s old news in the Music Business.<br/><br/>Please don&#39;t penalize me for now having better tools to do my job. <br/>
