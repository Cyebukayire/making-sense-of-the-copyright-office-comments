I think there is a need to protect the creators in this situation. A lot of creators do NOT want their work taken without permission and used to train AI to make work modeled after them! They put a lot of effort into that and now most companies are simply announcing that they will be letting AI into their database without any way to opt out. It is frustrating, offensive, and plain rude. If anything, I would say AI should be considered uncopyrightable, to be used like a stock photo. If something is not done, not only will a lot of people needlessly lose their jobs, but propaganda will be on a whole new level, with people being able to create an image of someone publicly recognizable doing something embarrassing and no one will tell if it is real or not. Besides. AI as it&#39;s being used now, to create art, is a solution to a complete non-problem. Most people like to do art, if left alone, they choose to some form of art. Why are we leeting the robots create art as we have to do the manual labor?
