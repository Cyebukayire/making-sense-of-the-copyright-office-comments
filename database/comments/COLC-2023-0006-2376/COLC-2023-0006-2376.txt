AI can not exist without sampling hundreds of already copywrighted works. Creators of &ldquo;AI art&rdquo;, if you can even call it that, don&rsquo;t have anything without inputting other people&rsquo;s works into their formula. Sure, their mimicry might not always be glaringly obvious, but it would not exist without the labor of a human involved. There is already legal precedent against the copyright of AI, which understood the point about it being work purposefully stolen from another artist - which is the golden word. It isn&rsquo;t an accident that these &ldquo;artists&rdquo; are using other people&rsquo;s work, and happen to stumble upon an AI&rsquo;s generated art. It is purposeful malfeasance against the wishes of an artist, writer, actor, director - you name it. It harms an artist&rsquo;s time and reputation by having a worse off copy of something attached with their style (see: Wes Andersen&rsquo;s TikTok copycats, or Tim Burton styled Disney Princesses). It has no business being safe under copyright law when copyrights exist in the first place to protect ORIGINAL art. There is nothing original about AI, which is only a formula - take in data, and spit out a mix of it all. Please regulate it or the entire creative profession - which regularly thousands of jobs mostly by lower level players, and not &ldquo;selfish Hollywood stars&rdquo; like it has been called - along with any profession that involves any kind of original thinking, and decision-making, is permanently in jeopardy.
