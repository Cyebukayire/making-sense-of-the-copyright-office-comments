I&#39;m an artist that uses AI tools to assist in my creative process, and I&#39;m inventing new processes using these tools, and wish to comment that I believe that Copyright protections already existing for &quot;derivative works&quot; that have &quot;significant alterations&quot; by the artist, such a Merz, Collage, Dadaism, and other surrealist and expressionist works, including animations such as I make, should be given equal protections.
