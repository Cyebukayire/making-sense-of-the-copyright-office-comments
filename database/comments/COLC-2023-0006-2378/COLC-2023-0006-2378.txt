I believe that a person&#39;s art should be there&#39;s no matter what tool is used. I often hear filmmakers and actors reference other movies and characters to create their own personal stories and characters. Everyone is inspired by everyone, but in the end, all art has its own voice. Hence, protections for that art should apply, AI art included. My mobster won&#39;t be like your mobster movie, but we&#39;ve both made a mobster movie. That&#39;s why they were copy written. Martin Scorcese makes different style of crime movies than that of a filmmaker like Michael Mann. Should they not be protected because they both made a crime movie? Well, they obviously are, so AI art should be no different. AI is a chance to finally give the little guy the ability to compete with the big leagues. Don&#39;t destroy this crucial moment for millions of people starving to have their vision come to life.
