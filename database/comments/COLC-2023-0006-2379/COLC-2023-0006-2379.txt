I believe that the source material that was used for these tools were sourced in an unethical manner and without consent by the creative individuals. While I appreciate what these tools can potentially bring to the creative endeavors of many, I believe that the sourcing of other artists ideas, styles or distinct visual characteristics allow for the output of this tool to align too closely to the source material. This is creating works that cannot be considered original or disconnected from the source in a way that can be morally acceptable. I worry that the point we are at now means that the only way to secure unique and original ideas from these tools would require that they be dismantled.
