Thank you for offering a comment period on copyright and AI. I have a few points I would like to share in hopes that influences the regulatory framework. <br/><br/>1. AI tools like a large language model (LLM) are simply tools. We have had technical improvements with typewriters, word processors, and software with autocomplete.  There has never been a question of authorship in these cases. Why should an advanced AI model be different?<br/><br/>2. There is a difference between a tool that creates a work without human input and one that requires substantial guidance to assist in the creation of a work.  Even the most sophisticated AI model needs human input to guide, curate, and refine the output.  Does it augment productivity?  Sure.  But it does not replace human creativity.<br/><br/>3. Denying copyright could restrict innovation in the AI space and put small content creators who use AI tools at a serious disadvantage.  Another consideration would be the impracticality of identification of AI content.  It seems impractical to expect humans to be able to detect AI content with 100% accuracy or have algorithms do so. Since there is no accurate validation mechanism, enforcement would be arbitrary.  Small creators who are denied copyright may not have the means to sue the US Copyright Office to reverse the decision.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the role of AI, especially LLM models, should be viewed as an extension of the creative tools available to creators. LLM models require human input and creativity to produce any content, let alone good content.  Finally, the impracticality of fair and accurate enforcement seals the case.  AI is a tool and authors that use a tool should not be punished.<br/>
