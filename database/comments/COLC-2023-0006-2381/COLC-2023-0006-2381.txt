I&rsquo;m a writer. Not by trade, as my health prevents me from taking part as consistently as I&rsquo;d like, but I would like to be able to maybe self publish a small anthology some day. The rise of AI has made me fearful of sharing my writing with others and I&rsquo;ve had to lock it away to prevent it from being scrapped off websites without my knowledge or permission and used to train AI.
