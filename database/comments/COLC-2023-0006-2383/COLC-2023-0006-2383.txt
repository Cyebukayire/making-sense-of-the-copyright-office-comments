Creativity is a vital part of human expression going back to ancient cave paintings from the dawn of human culture. We write, we sing, we paint and create as a way to express ourselves, the way we are alike and the ways we are different. We may be influenced by the past but, we add our own lived experiences to our part in expressive creation. AI by definition has no lived experience. It harvests, it digests, it extrapolates but, it will never feel. Having future art influenced by the regurgitations of a mechanical assessment of humanity and having that feedback into what AI things we are risks slowly breeding humanity out of creation and that leaves us all poorer for the loss. <br/><br/>Additionally, losing all hope of dealing with a real person opens up some massive security risks and machines that can think and act far faster than we can. No information can be trusted, no face no speaker. Facts are no longer facts when a plausible statement can be created shown and spoken. Evidence as we now know it goes away as a tool. <br/><br/>Please regulate AI to prevent an inhuman future while we work on creating a humane one.
