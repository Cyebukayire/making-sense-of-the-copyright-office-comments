I consider it absolutely VITAL that the copyright office take a stand against the legality of training AI from existing material without permission from the creators of said material. It&#39;s appalling, shocking, and horrifying to me that most AI has been trained and developed from human creators&#39; work, entirely without said human creators&#39; permission. I cannot BELIEVE this has been PRESUMED to be legal. This is stolen content. Period. It&#39;s very, very clear. AI technology has been trained on artists&#39; content without their consent, and many individuals and corporations now hope to use the technology that has been build off of this stolen work to replace human artists themselves. How is it even possible not to call this plagiarism and theft??? Absolutely ABSURD to think of it any other way. Insane. And blatantly immoral. <br/><br/>Thank you.
