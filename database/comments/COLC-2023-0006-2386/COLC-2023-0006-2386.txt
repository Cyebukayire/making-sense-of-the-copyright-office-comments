I have various concerns about the future of copyright law as it pertains to AI. On one hand, I want AI to be a violation of copyright (as in, the affected parties such as actors, musicians, and artists have a say on whether or not an individual or organization can use their likeliness for commercial use), however, on the other hand, I believe it would be a trickier subject when it comes to whose IP is whose. <br/><br/>If a voice actress complains that her voice is being used for nefarious reasons, I believe she has every right to be able to sue in the name of copyright infringement. However, what if her character is saying those things? What happens when the company owns that aspect of her voice? While I do believe they should be able to sue, that would possibly backfire with some parties claiming false copyright statements.<br/><br/>I&#39;m leaning more towards wanting the original artists affected by AI to be able to copyright their works and not have them stolen by AI. With regards to the AI and the creator of the program, they should not be able to claim anything as they haven&#39;t made anything, just taken from various sources around the web.<br/><br/>Thank you.
