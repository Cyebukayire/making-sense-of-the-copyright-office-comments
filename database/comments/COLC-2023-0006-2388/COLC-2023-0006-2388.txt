Artists were not asked or compensated when their art was stolen by AI companies. Fake machine art must be shut down. <br/><br/>I can imagine you will be swamped by replies from fake bot accounts. This is the problem! Undermine artists, and you our undermine our democracy. Please take a stand against machine art!
