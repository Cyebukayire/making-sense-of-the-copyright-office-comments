My art should not be used to train machines without my consent. My art should not be fed to a machine to be scrambled without my consent. A social media platform like Twitter should not be able to suddenly decide that every image I&#39;ve put on their platform is subject to being scraped by AI. Nobody&#39;s work should be scraped without their consent, and if it is, then the product of this scraping should not be copyrightable.
