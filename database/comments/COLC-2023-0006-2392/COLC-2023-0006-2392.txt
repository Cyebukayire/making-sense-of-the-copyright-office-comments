I don&#39;t  think  Ai art  or writing should  be able to be copyrighted. Any person can tell it the same thing as another person  and get the same image  or story . It&#39;s  a computer  program scanning  people&#39;s  hard work  and stealing it with out their consent. I thinks wrong to copyright  something that isn&#39;t original  or done by someone&#39;s  hands. <br/>
