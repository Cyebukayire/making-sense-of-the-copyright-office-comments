I paint, post my work online, and occasionally sell pieces of work. In the art world &quot;stealing&quot; or replicating someone&#39;s work or ideas with your own flair is common, and something expected. What&#39;s not expected is someone copying your work directly, as though they right clicked on your work and hit copy and pasted it elsewhere. That&#39;s basically what these AI tools are doing. They&#39;re not inventing original ideas, they&#39;re copying and pasting and mixing up other people&#39;s ideas. In any other field, that&#39;s called plagiarism and can get someone in very serious trouble. I sign my work as well, and by law this is supposed to copyright it, which means people aren&#39;t supposed to be able to lift my work from the internet and sell it without my consent and paying me for it, yet these tools were developed without any consent from the actual artists inventing original ideas, and certainly none of them are getting paid. I&#39;m not even clear how it&#39;s legal to do that. I am a hobbyist, really, and I&#39;m upset by this. I can&#39;t even imagine what it must be like to be working as an artist or writer for a living and knowing tech bros making way more money than you&#39;ll ever see are about to put you out of business entirely. These technologies need to be regulated. It&#39;s not fair to working artists that they aren&#39;t. I think laws need to be put in place that say these tools are not allowed to copy anyone&#39;s work without consent of the individual artist (not just the consent of the hosting websites or companies where people post their work). People should be able to opt out if they want to. And if AI tools are going to use people&#39;s work, they should have to pay for it. Websites could easily charge a fee that goes into keeping the servers running or gets distributed to the artists in exchange for using the work for developing AI tools. I also think laws that are more forward thinking would be smart. Art is not the only field AI is going to come up in. Obviously this is out of the scope of this topic, but examining other industries where AI might be used and seeing how it would affect employment might be smart, and asking if we WANT a computer involved. I may not want an AI doctor, for example, especially not one trained on our current medical system and all of its existing biases (I am also a woman). Asking the question of is AI always good I think is warranted. A hammer is tool, but you don&#39;t need a hammer in every circumstance. AI tools are just that, they&#39;re tools and we need to figure out where we as a society feel they&#39;d be best used.
