You can&rsquo;t hold the tide with a broom. AI is the tool that will help liberate disenfranchised artists, creatives, thinkers and engineers locked outside of the system behind a steep barrier to entry based solely in monetary foundations. Those who don&rsquo;t have the resources to realize their visions can now create what was once impossible a generation ago. The only entities against AI are Luddite&rsquo;s and studios holding a monopoly on distribution and production eco systems. Imagine a 14 yr old kid from Oklahoma who can finally tell their story as a cinematic opus, revealing a profound truth about the human experience no one but them could have conceived. This is an eventuality made possibly by AI engines able to manifest digital imagery to their tune. That kids story would never have been able to reach the light of day given the lottery of life, but now they have a voice and the tools to do so.<br/><br/>People that suggest using ai somehow infringes on creative already created, can&rsquo;t see past their own nose. If you go to a museum and sketch a painting, then paint it for yourself as a replica, you are committing the same form of inspiration as ai referencing original content. The ai is just extremely proficient at its technique so it can create likenesses with far better accuracy. But such is the story with all forms of emerging technology.<br/><br/>When the photograph was invented, they cried it will be the end of painting. <br/><br/>When the combustible engine was given life, the horse and buggy operators were scorned. <br/><br/>The government should stay far away from regulating anything with ai and creativity. All that will happen is algorithmic creation by developers to circumnavigate any insignificant statue in place. Any effort to stop the progress of ai is so futile it&rsquo;s laughable this is even a conversation.<br/><br/>As an anecdote. I have been using the emerging rudimentary forms of AI to help visualize writing of my as actual scenes in a movie by way of conceptual photographs. To see my visions come to life has been so thrilling; it&rsquo;s inspired me beyond any other form of self actualization as a writer. To be able to create and see a tangible result outside of theory and imagination, is truly inspiring. In a couple of years time then being able to watch my own film completely synthesized would be the stuff of dreams and science fiction. I&rsquo;m excited for it. <br/><br/>I have attached some screen-grabs I made to help visualize a script I&rsquo;ve written to illustrate the power of this technology. <br/><br/>Recommended reading &ldquo;the singularity is near&rdquo; by ray kurzweil. <br/><br/>(Apologies for typos, sent on my iPhone.)
