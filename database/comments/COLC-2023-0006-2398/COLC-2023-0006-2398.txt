Art is the one of the few things that has always defined humankind. Its how we have studied times past and how i hope we study our time now, in the future. I hope that they can see what WE created not an intelligent program. Creativity is the one thing we should not take away from humanity. Take the hard labor, the tedious days of paperwork, the endless hours, and let us do what we do best and creat and innovate. We should not give the ai the freedom to create that most people today cannot do because of their menial jobs. This AI is so new as well. Let us paint, write, sing, and study while they take on our burdens. Its full capabilities are not known to the public, and i fear what it could do. I am no expert on computer science but i have taken enough classes to know that what we have now is just the beginning. We need to wait to see its full potential before we let it have free reign. Do not let it win before we even know what it is capable of, not only in its own hands, but ours as well. It is not art, it is a composite of stolen art compressed and spit out again, because we could not give it the tools to create on its own, so it takes our art instead. So i urge you, prevent ai from taking or holding any sway in art. Im just a kid and i know that if we give it any ability to be copyrighted companies will no longer use the actual artists, and instead will only use AI. Preserve humanity, not the machines
