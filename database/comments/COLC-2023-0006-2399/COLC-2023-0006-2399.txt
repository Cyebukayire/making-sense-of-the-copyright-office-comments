AI art in its current form relies on existing art to train models and create derivatives. By using a machine to obfuscate the process employers of the technology can circumvent obtaining permission from those whose works are being plagiarised. There is little way to verify what models don&#39;t utilise datasets with only art they were given express permission to use, and companies may leverage the technology and unbalanced contracts to take ownership of the works of artists and writers to indefinitely create derivatives without their consent. Therefore, AI-generated art of all kinds should be exempt from any copyright protections, as should work that is in-turn derived from those works. If human creativity has any value then it is necessary the protections human-made art is granted to not extend to algorithms.
