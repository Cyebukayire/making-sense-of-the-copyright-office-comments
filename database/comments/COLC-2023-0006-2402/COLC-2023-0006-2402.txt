Gosh I&#39;m not sure what to say. I worry about ai, where if we start using ai to generate anything and everything, people&#39;s &quot;voice&quot; will be filtered and retrofitted into something else. As a writer I hate that I can&#39;t prove I didn&#39;t have ai generate something for me.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I want a future like the Orville, where an ai can generate anything a person could want, but people still value bespoke actions and objects that a person took the time to do or make themselves.<br/><br/>I worry that ease and convenience of ai will be the death of original ideas and unfiltered thoughts. That&#39;s why I support not giving ai generated works copyright protection. Buy I think we need to do more. If we want a good future, a better future, we need to do more than just replace the artist with ai. We need to enable them so that ai is a training tool not a replacement.<br/>
