I am a voice narrator and actor by trade. I have already seen my industry decline massively in just one years time due to AI abuse in voice over. This is simply a matter of taxpaying citizens being cut out by (often large) corporate entities whom refuse to let anybody step on their completely unprohibited profit. The cost is high. Real people are losing their careers almost overnight. Leverage is weak and dwindling under the threat of automation, quality be damned. Our industry suffers, out entertainment, education and overall experience in vast amounts of media and content will suffer greatly at the hands of a lifeless attempt at voice over. I say it should not be so easily pushed about in the arts. It steals from existing work and twists it into a boring, bland and faceless money machine.
