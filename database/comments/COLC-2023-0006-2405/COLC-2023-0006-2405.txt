No creative work which does not originate solely from human creativity and effort should be granted copyright. The intent of copyright was to protect human effort and creation, not simply to create corporate profit. Even if a AI created work involved humans after it&rsquo;s creation, as it&rsquo;s genesis and initial generation did not involve humans, it is nothing more than a derivative work which itself cannot be copyrighted.
