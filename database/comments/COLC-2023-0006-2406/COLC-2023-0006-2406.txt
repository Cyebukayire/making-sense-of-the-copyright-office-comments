As a writer, I have practiced hard to create my own unique voice in my writing, and as I have been writing as a hobby for over a decade, that&#39;s a lot of practice. While generative AI has yet to create anything of substantive quality (in fact quite the opposite on many occasions) the idea of a generative AI being trained on my work without my knowledge or consent is frankly disconcerting. <br/><br/>These AI companies have been training their AIs without care from where the data their bots are trained with come from. The ethical issues of scraping and using someone else&#39;s work without the creator&#39;s consent are self-evident and substantial. <br/><br/>There have been cases of someone taking an AI, training it on an author&#39;s books, and then publishing the resulting generated text as &quot;books&quot; on amazon. Resulting in a theft of the unique literary voice of that author. <br/><br/>Without proper regulation on what a generative AI can be trained on such abuses are likely to happen on a wide scale, especially as large sections of corporations have opted to use AI for one reason or another, likely without care for what the AI has been trained on to get the desired output. <br/><br/>I hope the office will put in place regulations that strictly curtail what a generative AI can be trained on and what it can be used for.
