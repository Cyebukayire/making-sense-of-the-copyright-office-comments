Artificial Intelligence should remain a tool for people to use, it should never been seen as superior to human creativity, inventiveness and ingenuity. Books, screenplays, articles etc should not be written by AI but can be reviewed, edited or adjusted using AI, especially to check for errors or plagiarism. There should always be limits placed on AI, so that future generations of children and young adults have the chance to express themselves artistically without worrying about being overshadowed by machine learning. It also wouldn&rsquo;t be good for independent thought and study to become any lazier than it already is, once before you had to look through several books, or make a few phone calls and talk to experts to learn something new or research a specific topic, now you can just scroll through a few pages of google or YouTube to find the information you&rsquo;re looking for, do we really need this to get any easier. AI should be made to assist, to educate, and to encourage independent thought and study, not to out-do it all.
