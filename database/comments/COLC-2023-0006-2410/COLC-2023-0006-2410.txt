Regardless of where anyone stands on human versus machine authorship, Generative AI does not produce original work.  It is not capable of producing original work. As a sophisticated predictive text generator, AI assemles textual content by scraping a vast store of online data to create the most likely fit for any given sentence. By doing this it is creating a kind of crowdsourced &quot;Mad Libs&quot; document. Not exactly plagiarism, but also nothing resembling an original idea. <br/><br/>Text created by generative AI should not be copyrightable. And even beyond that, I think it&#39;s a mistake to allow content production companies to utilize AI to write sequels and derivative works based on original characters created by humans. Because the output from the AI will always be a collection of scraps cobbled together in a form that resembles original creative work, but has no authentic creative intelligence as its source. <br/><br/>
