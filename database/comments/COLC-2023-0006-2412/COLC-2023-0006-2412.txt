AI in film should be reserved for post production, animation and visual effects. As a whole, AI cannot replace humans or the human condition and should only be used as a tool to help humans create more realistic executions of their visions or dreams. AI needs regulation on the side of the parent company, the company using it and the agency supporting the artist. To say though that AI will replace humans is wrong. It can only help humans if we research it more. No one can replace humans and to say that AI will is to say that humans have no say in what AI can do when it&rsquo;s humans that shape and guide AI in the first place.
