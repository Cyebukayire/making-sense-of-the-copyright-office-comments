 <br/><br/>U.S. Copyright Office <br/><br/>Attn: Artificial Intelligence and Copyright Study <br/><br/>101 Independence Ave SE <br/><br/>Washington, D.C. 20559 <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Subject: Comment on Notice of Inquiry and Request for Comments - Docket No. 2023&ndash;6 <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dear Copyright Office, <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>I am writing to provide my input on the important and timely issue of artificial intelligence (AI) and copyright. As an AI enthusiast and concerned citizen, I believe that addressing the copyright law and policy issues raised by AI systems is important to fostering innovation while maintaining respect for intellectual property rights. I would like to address question 9.1 regarding whether the consent of the copyright owner should be required for all uses of copyrighted works to train AI models or only for commercial uses. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>In my opinion, requiring the consent of the copyright owner for all uses of copyrighted works to train AI models, including non-commercial uses, may pose practical challenges and suppress the potential benefits that AI can bring to us. While I acknowledge the importance of protecting the rights of creators, it is equally important to keep a balance that allows for the responsible and innovative use of AI technologies. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>AI models often require vast datasets to learn and improve their capabilities. If consent were required for all uses, it could impede the development of AI models, particularly in cases where obtaining consent from multiple copyright owners is unfeasible or impractical. Additionally, it may hinder nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, and independent researchers from utilizing AI for socially beneficial purposes, such as medical research, climate modeling, or historical preservation. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Instead of an all-encompassing consent requirement, I propose a more subtle approach. Copyright owners could be given the option to specify their preferences regarding the use of their works for AI training. They could choose to permit or deny such use and indicate whether they require attribution or compensation. This approach respects the rights of copyright owners while allowing for a more flexible and adaptive AI ecosystem. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Moreover, I suggest the development of standardized licensing agreements that facilitate the use of copyrighted works for AI training purposes. These agreements could define the terms and conditions for use, compensation mechanisms, and dispute resolution procedures, streamlining the process for AI developers and copyright owners. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>To ensure transparency and fairness, it is imperative to establish a centralized database or platform where copyright owners can register their works and preferences regarding AI usage. AI developers could then access this database to determine the status of a specific work and proceed accordingly, simplifying compliance. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>In conclusion, while it is crucial to protect copyright owners&#39; interests, an outright requirement for consent in all AI training scenarios may hinder innovation and socially beneficial AI applications. A more balanced approach that respects copyright while allowing for flexibility and collaboration is needed. Standardized licensing agreements and a centralized database can facilitate this approach, fostering a thriving AI ecosystem that benefits both creators and society at large. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this matter. I hope that my perspective contributes to the ongoing discussion and helps inform the development of copyright policies that support the responsible and ethical use of AI. <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Concerned Citizen
