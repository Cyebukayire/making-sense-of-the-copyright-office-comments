9. They should be provided with both options<br/>9.1 It should be required by both<br/>9.2 There should be a block to access for training on AI on the work itself, AI should not be able to access it without the owner&#39;s affirmative consent<br/>9.4 Firstly, there should be a payment to the owner. Secondly, the data collected from the work should be removed. That will be hard but necessary. <br/>10. It should require a formal document (a pre-made one by the US Copyright Office) that states who owns the work and how it may be used. The document cannot be made by either party involved so as not to create severe bias and loopholes. The AI company/developer would have to show where the information goes and have it as a separate piece that is able to be removed at any point in time. The document would have to be signed by both parties and compensation should be provided to both the US Copyright Office and the creator of the work. <br/>10.1 It hopefully should be<br/>10.3 Yes to the first part of this question, I&#39;m unsure about the rest<br/>12. As of 9/16/2023 I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s possible to identify separate works but in the future it should be included as a separate data asset that you are able to track throughout the system.<br/>14. Online there&#39;s a wealth of fan created works based off of another previous work. Please consider that those are still people writing, I don&#39;t know the legality or copyrights associated with it but there should be some protections for them because it is their own work.<br/>15. Yes and yes.<br/>15.1 Extreme specificity to credit the original creator(s)<br/>15.2 Everyone who uses or sees the generated work(s)<br/>16. Before that the creator should be asked then notified if it is used<br/>17. I&#39;m unsure of anything specific but if there aren&#39;t any there should be<br/>28. Yes. In all contexts but specifically in ones that interact with humans. There should be a disclaimer before and after the generated work (possibly in the middle as well).<br/>28.1 The AI itself, the people who use it and the people who made it.<br/>28.3 Immediate removal of the work, a fine and notification that it was an AI based work.<br/>30. Actor&#39;s unions have some things about this I believe. I also think that identity-theft laws apply here.<br/>31. Yes. Yes this is a national issue. And to the last part of the question, I&#39;m unsure.<br/>32. Yes. Everyone, digital mediums included that are found on the internet. I am also unsure about this last part of the question.<br/>34. Public access works. Things that are found within The Organization of Transformative Works and other public websites.
