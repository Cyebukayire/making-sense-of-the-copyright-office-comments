Hello. I am an artist and my field is being overtaken by corporations choosing to pay significantly less for AI than pay for the creativity and ingenuity of real artists. This will will lead to a degradation of standards for media in our country, and will take jobs away from those of us who have a story to tell. AI does not create anything new, because it is trained on images off the internet which more often than not were gathered without the original artist&rsquo;s consent. It cannot make anything from lived experience because it has none. That is why AI needs to be regulated more strictly than it is, because AI inherently has no knowledge of the human experience.
