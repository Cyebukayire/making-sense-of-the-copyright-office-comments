We desperately need legal regulation of A.I. on a federal level. The work generated from A.I. is only possible by taking the accumulative work and likenesses of thousands of people, likely without their consent, and then sold for profit in a way that doesn&#39;t benefit the original works or likenesses. This kind of use of works is fundamentally unethical. <br/><br/>We are in the middle of an unprecedented  labor movement. I am a member of a union. I work in entertainment, TV and film production. This kind of technology is threatening the livelihood and personal rights of everyone that shows up to work everyday. A federal intervention in necessary now.
