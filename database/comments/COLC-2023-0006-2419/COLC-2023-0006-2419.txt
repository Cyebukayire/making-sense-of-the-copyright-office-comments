AI creations cannot be copyrighted. There are numerous reasons for this.<br/>1. You cannot copyright something that you nor anybody else actually created. This was made by a machine. More importantly, designed by a machine. What intellectual property rights could you claim for something your intellect took no part in creating? <br/>2. Others could easily reproduce the copyrighted AI works without the intention to do so. This would open them up to being sued for something that they didn&#39;t create. A computer could create the same piece of art/writing hundreds of times, since the name AI is, after all, incredibly misleading. It simply draws from a set database. It&#39;s no more artificial intelligence than autocorrect is.<br/>3. The only viable solution to ensure that copyrighted works are not reproduced by the same AI engine would be to yank the materials from the engine that were used to create the copyrighted work. This is not viable in the long run, as inevitably these databases will run dry.<br/><br/>Those are the practical reasons. On a personal level, AI being copyrightable removes jobs from the arts industry and therefore damages the economy. Not to mention calling something that a machine created &quot;your art&quot; is incredibly insulting to someone who actually creates.
