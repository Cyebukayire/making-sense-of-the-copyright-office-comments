I support the position that human authorship is required for copyright to apply. Although many works which were created using AI have been guided by humans and would have been different without human participation, I don&rsquo;t believe that qualifies as &ldquo;authorship&rdquo;. I would find it very unfair to grant copyright to anything that is made up of the intellectual property of people who were not asked if their work could be included.
