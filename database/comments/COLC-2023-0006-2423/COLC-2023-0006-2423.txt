The current output of Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning should not be considered copywritable to any extent. Until every piece of data that goes into a databank is acquired with full consent, full disclosure, and is original work for the express purpose of expanding that particular data bank; it will continue to subsist on material not willingly provided. There are sites and companies not only scraping images, text, and other media without express consent or disclosure, but many more that are doing so as part of a &quot;terms of use&quot; for a service, long after a service is provided or in use, with a simple caveat of &quot;if you do not agree to our AI scraping your content, uninstall our platform&quot; despite archived or prior use. Anything coming from this type of non or dubious consent should be unable to be copywritable. If a developer wishes to have a copywritable generative AI, they need to personally own the original rights to use everything that goes into the databank through legal and ethical means.
