Thank you for taking the time to ask the general population about this issue. The subject is extremely important - especially to creators. As an artist and author, I&#39;m afraid to put my art out in the world because it could be so easily stolen and used by AI. Fiction, digital art, songs... anything. If I have put my heart into something, I don&#39;t want others to use it without my permission. And using AIs to get around that, using crawlers to bypass responsibility, is immoral and extremely hurtful to the creative community. We shouldn&#39;t need to be hesitant to create because there is a legal way to get around the few protections that we have. In an era where rights are so contentious, it becomes even more important to protect those we do have. And especially given that we creators often live off of the meager earnings we might make on our work, the ability of others to use them makes it harder and harder for art to survive in an increasingly harsh world. Now, if companies want to purchase my art to add to their AI training programs, that would be fine. But they can&#39;t be allowed to steal art. Please help us. Thank you.
