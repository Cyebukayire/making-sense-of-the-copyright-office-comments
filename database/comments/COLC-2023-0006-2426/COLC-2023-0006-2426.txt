Simply put, AI is train without any user, organization, or consent from any intellectual property &quot;IP&quot;. This harms creatives, known better as &quot;Artists&quot;: Illustrators, musicians, photographers, writers, etc. Their works are trained on AI models and algorithms, with allow them to output whatever data was fed to them. This would be better in an ideal world where said artists were asked, but they are not.<br/><br/>Artists have concern of not just exploit, but misinformation, misinterpretation and abuse. Their art could be used to train AI for malicious intent.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this could pose a threat to any everyday user of the internet, as they could be led wrongly.<br/><br/>No one wants this - artists don&rsquo;t want the data to public, but consented to. Any AI model should NOT use any data or information, unless if consent and said proof of consent is given.<br/><br/>
