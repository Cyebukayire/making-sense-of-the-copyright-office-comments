Artificial intelligence is dangerous and can cost many people jobs, and for what? A bland reproduction of something we have seen before? Part of the joy of life is creation. Music, art, writing. Using AI for that robs us all. The best art communicates something the artist is trying to say. It spreads ideas and evokes emotions in others. AI art can not do that. It is incapable. It has to take from others, without their permission. Artists already struggle to get paid their fair share. Yes, they learn from past artists, but the art they make is their own. Not formulaic or algorithmic. Anything AI makes comes directly from millions of uncredited artists, and that is not fair or just. Letting AI grow in this way without restriction or control will lead to less art overall, because why make it if it&rsquo;s just going to be stolen by a computer run by a big corporation? There will be no joy. It is irresponsible to continue to allow artificial intelligence to take from creators without permission and to run rampant. This is not what this technology should be used for.
