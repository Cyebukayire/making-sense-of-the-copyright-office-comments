I&#39;ve been writing and sharing my stories, both original and transformative works, on the internet since the early 2000s. In that time, I&#39;ve dealt with my share of plagiarists who repost my works without seeking or receiving my permission. It is beyond frustrating to see my own work being passed off as someone else&#39;s, someone who did not spend the days, months, and years I spend creating the worlds and characters in my work.<br/><br/>AI like ChatGPT are the same problem, but on a more massive scale. Unlike traditional human &quot;copy and paste&quot; activity, AI can sweep through hundreds of stories in mere seconds. I&#39;ve received notices from the websites I post my work stating they&#39;ve been victims of AI trawling. I never gave my permission for my work to be used by AI. Permission from the copyright holder is not taken into consideration in AI work, but it should be. AI, those who run it, and those who create it should not be exempt from copyright laws, nor the consequences of breaking them. Even if someone inputs data created by others into an AI generator, they are not creating the end result through active thought and work. The human is not putting the words and sentences together, the AI is. There is no human authorship in that.
