Not only does training AI require the use of copywright works and works that cannot be legal copywrighted, which is blatant theft when &ldquo;trained&rdquo; AI pulls from them in order to supposedly create art, poetry, novels, etc but it also undermines some of the most wonderful careers and hobbies that humans have to be creative in. AI should strictly only be allowed for basic automation. Anything else is blatant job theft from the millions, possibly even billions who need work. The working class and poor are already exploited on a daily basis. If the jobs of writers, artists, actors, and so forth become slim to nonexistent due to exploitation of AI, then there is no longer any point for a single person to work. If AI can do it all then we should just be given luxury to live in a robot lead world. Life, therefore, becomes meaningless in an an already difficult society and world. Justice for the WGA, for the striking actors, for authors, for artists, and for workers everywhere. AI should be heavily restricted. That&rsquo;s all I really have to say on the matter.
