1. As described above, generative AI systems have the ability to produce material that would be copyrightable if it were created by a human author. What are your views on the potential benefits and risks of this technology? How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, technology developers, researchers, and the public?<br/>---<br/>It&#39;s not just plain theft, it&#39;s also a slippery slope of allowing these companies and people to take our data, from our art to our private photos, especially when it comes to women and children, who&#39;s photos can and are used for most nefarious purposes. AI could also be used to replace the only jobs that allow personal freedom as well as directly harming people&#39;s income that was acquired by one&#39;s life&#39;s work, not to mention it can exist as a tax loophole. It is also a new way to scam the public as many people have fallen for fake art gigs only to discover they paid a machine generate stolen content. This has hurt the trust of everyone involved, and can potentially even falsely accuse real creators. <br/><br/>Benefit wise, I don&#39;t see any justification for, besides letting a creator create the base of a work faster(by only using generations of their own work and samples), but the time saved wouldn&#39;t be nearly enough to excuse having such a thing being rampant, leaving the only real use to be as a mood board.<br/><br/>2. Does the increasing use or distribution of AI-generated material raise any unique issues for your sector or industry as compared to other copyright stakeholders?<br/>---<br/>Direct harm to my income and client interest as they can instead shove one&#39;s life&#39;s work into a machine and not pay a single heed to it. It also unrealistically raises the bar and expectation for art for the masses that don&#39;t do art, thus making it increasingly more difficult for others to participate in the craft - leading to a risk of art as a whole becoming lost.<br/><br/>The effect of AI, even mediocre one, has already been seen before in the translation field, where people spent decades of their lives learning foreign languages, only to see that translation destroyed by AI. The inferiority of the machine translations a few years back did not stop the destruction of the industry, as machine translation cost nothing, and so the price for all translation came crashing down, because of the saturated use of said machine translation.<br/><br/>Clients that keep the industries, creators and jobs going, do not care about the quality of the product they get. We cannot expect the clients to prize human made products as the vast majority of them will go for the process that costs less - bringing the whole world produce down with it. <br/><br/>6. What kinds of copyright-protected training materials are used to train AI models, and how are those materials collected and curated?<br/>---<br/>The most common way is to use social media to directly steal from creators and or using tools that mass-download entire databases indiscriminately. Said databases can at times involve people&#39;s personal information, leading to a whole new slew of problems. <br/><br/>7.1. How are training materials used and/or reproduced when training an AI model? Please include your understanding of the nature and duration of any reproduction of works that occur during the training process, as well as your views on the extent to which these activities implicate the exclusive rights of copyright owners.<br/>---<br/>The AI is incapable of creating anything original. All it does is take what it&#39;s been feed and forcefully merge it with everything else. It&#39;s an amalgamation of different copyrighted material without iterating nor creating anything truly original of it like a human would. It&#39;s the reason you see AI struggle when it has to create something that it does not have a direct replica of to use, as it is not a true intelligence that can use the material to improvise and create originals. It can only stitch together parts of existing material together to create the illusion of something new, but to the seasoned eye it becomes blatantly clear which material it was stolen from - this awareness and perception cannot be expected of clients, and thus they wouldn&#39;t care until scammed.<br/><br/>9.2. If an &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; approach were adopted, how would that process work for a copyright owner who objected to the use of their works for training? Are there technical tools that might facilitate this process, such as a technical flag or metadata indicating that an automated service should not collect and store a work for AI training uses?<br/>---<br/>There should be a way of tinkering with a work in such a way that AI cannot process it or realizes it&#39;s banned from doing so, eg: a stamp only the AI can identify and react to. From there, each AI model would have to verify that their AI is enabled to identify said stamp or check, otherwise they&#39;d labeled as illegal and fraudulent, this is to avoid AI models that would be created to bypass or ignore these checks.
