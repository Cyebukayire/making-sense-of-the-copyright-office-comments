Hello. I&#39;m a digital artist that creates Pixel Art (A form of digital art that uses very small canvas/screen resolutions to create a vintage appearance)., I am one of the many people who may be displaced if AI becomes a copyrightable material.<br/>The recent advent of AI has brought about many useful technologies, however the common-seen point of these technologies is to aid in manufacturing processes and to bring about a higher quality of life for consumers of products.<br/>AI models are trained on &#39;Datasets&#39; which are collections of digital information (Think photos, artwork, writing, articles, songs, and computer code), which is downloaded from the internet and then directly sampled in a resulting piece of imagery from the AI model, said downloaded work is included in the dataset usually without the consent of the rights holder of the source data. When the AI generates a result it directly grafts a portion of its source data onto the resulted image, some AI advocates will claim it &quot;Does the same thing the human brain does&quot; but that is fundamentally at odds with the way both the human mind and our current hardware functions, as computers are not capable of coming to conclusions that were not programmed in, and AIs as they exist are only algorithmic. In short, it would create less job opportunities than it would destroy, and it would displace a large population of people that have spent their lives gaining skill sets related to any form of creativity. The quality of products the end-user would get would go down and several sectors of the economy will begin to stagnate and/or shrink.<br/>Many companies have started to get the idea that AI can be used to wholly replace the work and job artists, programmers, musicians, writers, journalists, and more do. This would not only deprive people of their passions, but it would dissuade any and all future work in the industries that depend on these types of people, leading to worsening quality of products, and thus lessening the consumption of said products, effectively destroying any industries as well as any revenue generated. The pursuit of human creativity will have been effectively killed and the creation of truly new ideas and media will be permanently stunted for as long as this technology exists.
