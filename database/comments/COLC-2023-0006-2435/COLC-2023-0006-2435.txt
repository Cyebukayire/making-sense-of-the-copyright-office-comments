I do not and will not recognize AI created media as anything but AI. It is not art. It is not expression. It is, at best, plagiarism and at worst, something more nefarious. I am not alone in my thoughts and I pray that more creatives will combat this. Musicians, authors, visual artists, etc., do NOT deserve this.
