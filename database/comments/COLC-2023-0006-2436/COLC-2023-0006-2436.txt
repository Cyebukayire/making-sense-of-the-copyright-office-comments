AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; is based on stolen works. AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; used engines of scraping the Internet that did not have artist permission. AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; is benefitting from true artists without any form of compensation - stealing their style, experience and knowledge to turn a quick dollar for those that use it. It is a deplorable capitalistic exploitation that should not have any basis for copyright and should be regulated to the fullest extent so that any use of it does not remove human jobs as well as providing compensation to TRUE works of art that were inappropriately usurped to feed the capitalist AI engine.
