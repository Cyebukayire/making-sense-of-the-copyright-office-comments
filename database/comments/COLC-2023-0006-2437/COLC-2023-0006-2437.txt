To whom it may concern, <br/><br/>I believe that AI without intense regulation is harmful to American society. It not only affects economic development (taking over jobs), but it also affects education (anxiety over plagiarism), social media platforms (bots and data mining), and artwork on the whole. Make of this what you will. If left unchecked, AI spells trouble across multiple systems.
