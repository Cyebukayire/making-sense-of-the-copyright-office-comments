The role of AI in our world and our country should be used as a tool to advance us and not to take away human creativity or privacy, which is what will happen if nothing is done. People&rsquo;s likenesses could be used to infinity without compensation or without permission in unsavory content in extreme cases if nothing is done. Jobs now requiring human work will be replaced, and people will be left out of work entirely because they won&rsquo;t be needed while other industries will cheat and restructure jobs to keep certain people in power of industries that don&rsquo;t need them. There is an incredible opportunity for certain industries and a certain class in this world to use AI to its advantage and screw everyone else more that&rsquo;s they already are, which is another thing that could go wrong. I don&rsquo;t know all the answers but I can say that I think  regulating how people use this in terms of violating individual rights and privacy is pretty obvious good start. Stop this from hurting people before it gets out of hand. Another thing is to make sure it can&rsquo;t be used to create more inequity, which is a strong possibility. Again I don&rsquo;t know all the answers but I don&rsquo;t think leaving this unchecked and in the hands of major corporations, and people out to do harm to others is a good idea.
