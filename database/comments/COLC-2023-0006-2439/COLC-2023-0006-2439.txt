AI should not be allowed to be copyrighted. It is essentially stolen work from people who actually put in the time and effort to either draw, write, or create things for others to consume. It&#39;s hardly fair and absolutely shouldn&#39;t be legal for others to put in a prompt and allow AI to spit out work that&#39;s been pulled from existing source material and then claim it as &quot;original&quot; that they in turn want to profit from. <br/><br/>If people want to use AI for fun, by all means let them, but AI works should never be allowed to be copyrighted or used for profit. What AI does would not exist without stealing from authors, artists, and other creatives.
