While AI may in the future be a valuable tool, current data sets and regulations along with opaque business practices make it impossible to use ethically. For the time being, laws need to be put in place to protect real creators (writers, actors, artists, etc.) and their creations from what AI currently is, which is plain theft. Businesses using AI should also be instructed on how to use it ethically and companies providing AI services should be under strict scrutiny, both in the data sets being used to train their models, and the ways in which the generative process is being achieved. Security should also be a large concern, with data sets being siloed so private data does not get out, and watermarks should be mandatory so things like deep fakes can be marked as AI and the people who generated the problematic content can be traced.
