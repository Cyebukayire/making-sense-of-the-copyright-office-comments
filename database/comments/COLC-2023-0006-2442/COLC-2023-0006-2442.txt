As a creative individual making visual art and sustaining a young small business, artificial intelligence (specifically image generation models) are a serious threat to myself and other creators. Many AI image generation models steal artwork from artists, which are protected under copyright, and then use those images to &#39;train&#39; the AI to reproduce images in styles similar to the artists that it scraped content from. These AI-generated images have already been used to replace real human artists for what would otherwise be paying jobs. AI models need to be regulated through copyright law to protect creators and their livelihoods.
