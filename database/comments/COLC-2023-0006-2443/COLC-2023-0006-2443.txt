The most pressing concern is over the ethical use of existing literary works to train the emerging, ever-more-sophisticated machine learning models. <br/><br/>Authors, whose livelihoods rely on the royalties and revenues generated from their intellectual property, should have a choice of whether or not to allow their works to be used to train AI models, and should be compensated for the licensing of this content. So far, AI companies have used literary works of authors without permission or compensation.<br/><br/>It is both ethical and fair that creators be remunerated when their works are used to train AI models, since the models leverage authors&#39; creative output to build and enhance their own commercial product. <br/><br/>Moreover, failure to compensate authors could stifle the vibrancy and diversity of literary creation in the long term, with writers unable to sustain themselves financially without due compensation. <br/><br/>Recognizing and adhering to a framework that respects and upholds the intellectual property rights of authors should be a requisite in the ongoing development and deployment of AI technologies. This not only preserves the integrity of literary works but also fosters a sustainable environment where creators are encouraged to produce original content, secure in the knowledge that their rights will be protected.
