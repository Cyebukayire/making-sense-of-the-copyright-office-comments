I personally believe AI harms people as a whole. When it comes to creating works such as art, writing, music, so on - being a creator while AI is rampant is difficult. It harms the views of creators and at times is hard to prosper. Views of being an engineer and waiting for a product to automatically isn&#39;t entirely harmed as their products are more widespread and consistently used nowadays.<br/><br/>Outside of the creating industry, from what I&#39;ve heard - AI is also used for plagiarizing works within schooling, colleges, and university. Not that it couldn&#39;t have been done before, but it is much more easier than before. It makes me concerned for this generation of students and graduates since they won&#39;t have experience with learning or researching properly.
