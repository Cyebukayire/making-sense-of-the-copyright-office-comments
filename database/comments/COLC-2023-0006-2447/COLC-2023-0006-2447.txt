Artificial Images generated by AI are drowning out the works of real artists. The AI has assimilated all of our works, which we shared online on our websites and portfolios, and used them for training and as latent images in their diffusion models.<br/>Artists promote their works using the internet. Sharing an image of an artwork online does not relinquish your rights to it! It is an infringement of the artist&rsquo;s  rights to use that image for any purpose.<br/>The Ai companies have scraped up all of our works without permission, and without thinking about the consequences. The output of their artificial image generators is now flooding the internet, social media, and all of the places where real artists have shared their art for the purpose of generating sales of their works or getting commissions for new work. <br/>The fact that the artificial images are competing for attention at the expense of the living artists whose works have been scraped. That is not &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; because the derivative artificial images are flooding out the real artists.<br/>There is no ignoring that the basis of artificial image generators is the works of living artists that have been absorbed. <br/>Copyright cannot be given to those works generated by AI, no matter how many prompts are entered, or how the artificial image is edited afterwards to disguise its origen, because the artificial image is already infringing the works of living artists.<br/>Furthermore, replacing actual artists with AI, for the sake of expedience and expense, does not deserve copyright protection for the artificial images. The laws of our country are for the benefit of its people. Copyright protection is to give the artist the benefit of his work.<br/>Attempting to gain copyright protection for artificial images, is a false equivalence, because they are not the same. An artist lives and dies. The work that an artist creates in his lifetime is more than simply a &ldquo;style&rdquo; to be emulated by a machine to rob him and his heirs for life&rsquo;s work. <br/>AI is not an artist, is not a writer, is not a person. AI is not the people, and it has no rights.
