The goal of copyright, as stated in the Constitution, is to &quot;promote the sciences and useful arts&quot; by means of allowing creators exclusive rights to those creations. Allowing AI-generated content to be copyrighted would destroy that. I work in information technology alongside people engaged in AI work, and I can see some disturbing trends being discussed quietly. Large institutions like major IT firms could use AI to generate vast quantities of material most of which would be gibberish, copyright all of it, and prevent further human creativity by foreclosing on the possibility of anybody else creating something like it. From time to time, such firms might look through their mostly useless libraries of automatically generated content to find something interesting, but the primary effect would be to stake out claims on material no one had actually even seen yet and lock out as many other creators as possible. The one with the biggest computers could copyright first and see if there was anything which actually advanced the sciences and useful arts later, if at all. Those without won&#39;t be able to even try to create anything for fear of running into a copyright on what is essentially a random collection of words which happens to be arranged in the shape of useful information. Copyright must be limited to the products of substantial human input. If not, it&#39;ll turn into a way for a wealthy and/or technologically sophisticated few to lock out everybody else.<br/>
