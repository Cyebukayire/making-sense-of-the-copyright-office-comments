All current forms of generative AI have been trained extensively and primarily on copyrighted source material. AI-generated content is inherent copyright infringement. Not only should it be ineligible for copyright protection, but greater regulations need to be put in place to protect existing copyrighted material from being scraped by AI. Consent for a person&rsquo;s writing, art, appearance, etc. to be used as a source for generative AI should ALWAYS be opt-in and NEVER a requirement for using an online service or website.
