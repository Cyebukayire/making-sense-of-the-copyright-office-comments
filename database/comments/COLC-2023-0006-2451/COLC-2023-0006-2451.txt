Copyrighted material should not be permitted to use for training Artificial Intelligence unless explicit consent is given by the copyright owner. Furthermore, you should not be allowed to copyright content produced by Artificial Intelligence because it can be way too similar to the intellectual property of the works it was trained on. This is nothing short of stealing.
