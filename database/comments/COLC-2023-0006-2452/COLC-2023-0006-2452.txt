In regards to the current discussions of Artificial Intelligence (referred from here as &quot;AI&quot;) and copyright, I give these thoughts as a person professionally in the field of technology, and an enthusiast of written and visual works. While AI can be a great tool that can assist authors, the sad reality is that AI engines (such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, among other public and private engines) have been used in several very egregious ways in recent years, that would warrant a current stay of course to only confer copyright to human authors of works only. Recent events, such as training AI to replicate the style, and even likeness, of recently deceased artists and actors (some I know from my social circle), and training AI to replace voice and human actors for corporate studio greed, are a couple of the most serious concerns that would harm all artistic vision by allowing the current state of AI to produce copyrightable works. <br/><br/>Other than concerns of outright thievery and training of already copyrighted works, which has already happened by bad actors using AI in a morally reprehensible way, current AI technology would flood the copyright office with works trained with data off of the Internet - including works already copyrighted and registered through the copyright office by actual artists, writers, and creators. I feel that it would take several more iterations into what we call AI before we have a serious discussion about completely computer generated works being copyrightable - there is a lot about the human process of art that is missing when used in current AI - artists, writers, and other creators train and work for years perfecting their craft and making the things that all people enjoy. AI, in its current form, would cheapen creative works to the extent that would highly disincentivize authors from creating in the future, and create an environment where the only real winners of AI copyrightable works would be technical companies and bad actors that only wish to profit from a technology that requires considerably less skill and talent to use than the human endeavor of creation and authorship.<br/><br/>AI has to be geared to account for more of the human process of creating art, to understand originality, and to be able to create in a manner that is more nuanced. For example, authors at time use references to refer to the things that they want to create. It may take years of understanding references  and study to develop a style and a way of conveying a message that is original and adds to the world of art. There is something unique in that process, because there becomes a point where that originality and life experience translates to a creation that deserves the benefits of original work and protection from infringement and plagiarism. While it can be appreciated how quickly AI puts things together for quick use, using this technology for work that can be considered copyrightable would be a severe, severe blow to human creators everywhere, for the mindless pursuit of profit. Allowing current AI works to be copyrightable also gives &quot;Copyright trolls&quot; - bad actors in law that use copyright as a cudgel to devalue and penalize creators - a tremendous amount of power to litigate against creators that cannot keep up with the speed of generated AI works and allow for more means for actual creators to have their written word, their art, their voice, and even their likeness to face unfair litigation by bad actors seeking to cash in on a tech craze without thinking on the harm that is being done to actual creators that deserve to have their works protected.<br/><br/>I feel that current AI can guide artists into possible directions for their work and work as a tool that can automate some tasks to help people be more efficient, but any potential benefits of the current age of AI have been soured by the many creators that have already been impacted by the massive plagarism, unethical use, and flood of uninspired, automated (and sometimes incorrect) work that can arise from AI in its current iteration. From artist and writer theft, to the very real concerns that visual and voice actors have with their voices and likenesses being replicated for use in AI in perpetuity, without their express permission, allowing current AI copyrightable works would open the flood gates to new levels of unethical AI use that will be irreparable to the pursuit of creative works by talented people that deserve copyright protection. With these considerations, I feel that Copyright must continue to only be conferred to human creators in order to protect the people that are genuinely creating works that we all enjoy.
