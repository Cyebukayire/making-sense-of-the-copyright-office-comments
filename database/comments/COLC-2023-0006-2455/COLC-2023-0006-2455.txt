I agree with the Copyright Offices that copyrights cannot be given for AI generated works. Regardless of source material or human involvement the end result of an AI generated work was not produced by a human and therefore copyright cannot be given. AI generated works must also disclose any and all source material the program was taught with. In addition permission must be sought to use source material in machine learning if not public domain. AI use in education must be banned outside of study or coursework pertaining to the topic of AI/machine learning. The use of AI to complete assignments is cheating and the use of AI to create coursework and curriculum is disingenuous and immoral. AI generated art/literature is a form of plagiarism and a major threat to creators. Additionally the use of AI in medicine is concerning and must never be used to replace human experience, only to supplement existing skills, knowledge and experience. AI must be heavily regulated.
