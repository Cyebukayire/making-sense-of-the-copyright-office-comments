I am less concerned about the use of copyrighted works in AI training than I am about increasing our already draconian copyright laws. I don&#39;t think restricting AI on a copyright basis will actually benefit smaller creators and artists. Large companies like Disney and Warner Bros already have access to mass amounts of copyrighted material that they can make their own AI databases out of---all this will do is incentivize them to keep these databases to themselves, and prevent creative and transformative use by other artists. Copyright law already conflicts extremely dangerously with First Amendment rights, and the general development of human culture. The ideal solution would be one that evens the playing field between massive media corporations and smaller artists. This could be achieved by requiring these AI programs to be open source and open access, by requiring AI-created works to be public domain, and, frankly, by expanding the public domain and shortening copyright terms as a whole. Don&#39;t let corporations use AI as an excuse to constrain the artistic commons.
