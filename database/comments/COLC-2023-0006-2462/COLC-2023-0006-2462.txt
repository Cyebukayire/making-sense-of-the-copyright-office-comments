AI programs are trained on existing art made by real, living artists, without the artists&#39; consent or knowledge, in order to replicate their work without giving said artists credit or pay.  This is art theft and intellectual property theft, plain and simple.  AI is a tool to get art without having to pay anyone for it.  And that&#39;s not even considering its many flaws (such as AI writing programs flat-out making up fake sources when used to write research papers).
