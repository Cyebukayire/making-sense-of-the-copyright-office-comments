The rise of Artificial Intelligence has been an exciting and frightening advancement in our modern lives. I believe that AI can do a lot of good in the world, but in the creative world, it has a different effect. When an individual types up a prompt in AI it will search the web and find pieces of existing art to craft the new AI art. &quot; Large sets of already-made art are used to teach these algorithms how to find patterns and styles that can be used to make new art.&quot; (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/what-is-ai-generated-art) These AI artists are stealing existing people&#39;s artwork and potentially profiting off it for future use. Towards the beginning of December 2022, artists decided to protest AI art by posting anti-AI art images on Artstation to show his/her concern for AI. (https://www.vice.com/en/article/ake9me/artists-are-revolt-against-ai-art-on-artstation). My concern is that the artist and the traditional will be devalued when juxtaposed with the effortless AI art. However, I believe AI could be used as a tool for regular artists without taking from others. The AI could be used to speed or clean up certain aspects of an individual&#39;s. Other than AI upscaling, I am unsure how this could be done since the technology is new. Overall, I believe that AI art is standing on the backs of the artists and would devalue traditional artists if copyright were granted to AI art.<br/><br/>Thank you for hearing me out and giving us the platform to voice our thoughts.
