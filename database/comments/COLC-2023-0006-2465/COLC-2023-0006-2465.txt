Copyright protection must continue to be limited to human authorship. Dismissing the human authorship definition would cause catastrophic and irreparable monetary and emotional damage to artists, writers, developers, designers, businesses (small and large) just to name a few.

There is no ethical or lawful reason to allow such content to be copyrighted.
