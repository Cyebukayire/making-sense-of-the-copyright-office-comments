Regarding AI. The content of AI that has been generated from the tool should not be copyrightable and should have consequences if used from an AI that has taken that work from the previous author/artist/owner without prior permission. AI users who generated the AI piece should not be allowed to call themselves the author of the piece and said pieces should not be allowed to become publishable. AI is theft unless that authors/artists of the original work being used to train said AI gave prior permission for their work to be used in such a way and they are compensated for such.
