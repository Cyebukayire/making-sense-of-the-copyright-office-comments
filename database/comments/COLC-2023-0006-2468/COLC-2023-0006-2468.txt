AI poses a tremendous and unacceptable threat to copyright and promotion/creating of art and literature.  There are no appropriate uses of AI training that relies on copyrighted works, nor is the use of AI reasonable or acceptable if it replaces human effort and creativity.  AI-generated art and books should not be copyrightable as they are not created by humans, despite any &#39;prompt&#39; that may be given *by* a human.  AI-generated content for academic use should be considered illegitimate and sanctions against the offender should be taken for promoting academic fraud and dishonesty.  Further, any company replacing human labor and creative effort with AI should be subject to government sanctions and, if legislators rise to the task of making such things illegal, legal action.
