I&#39;m an artist who has had their entire library of work scraped. It&#39;s painful to watch people make things that are plagiarized from your and your friend&#39;s unique works. AI is ethically wrong in it&#39;s current format, and there&#39;s no reason to allow large corporations to steal from every artist to fuel their own income. Laws need to be enacted to protect artists of all kinds from this predatory behavior.
