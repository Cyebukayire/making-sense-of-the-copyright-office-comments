You must crack down immediately on companies that are training their models on artistic or intellectual work to which they do not own the copyright. It is absolute theft and this is exactly what copyright was invented to protect. Just because the theft is behind the scenes doesn&#39;t make it any less of a theft. Please protect artists. Regulate and force AI companies to get permission and pay for any work before they can feed it into their models or let the public access it through an interface.
