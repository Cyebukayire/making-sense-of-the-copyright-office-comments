I felt compelled to comment on these subjects as a casual artist that follows a lot of other illustrators, animators and creatives. I ask that you swiftly and assertively disallow AI material any form of copyright and do not allow artists&#39; work to be fed into AI datasets or models without obvious and express permission from said artist. This includes traditional and digital art, voice acting, writing, music, animation, and various professional forms of creation. <br/><br/>I have seen an explosion of AI generated material overtaking everything from print-on-demand items (places like society6, redbubble), art print sites (Inprnt), music covers on Spotify, book covers and various social media feeds. Each one is a loss of revenue for artists. Non-artists frequently cannot tell this &quot;art&quot; has been made by a program re-purposing real people&#39;s time and expertise without permission. It is heavily impeding actual artists from being discovered and supporting themselves in a time where it is already hard enough to get by.<br/><br/>Artists I&#39;ve followed have been devastated when learning their style, which takes years upon years to craft, has been taught to an AI model. A program piecing together someone&#39;s brush strokes, someone&#39;s color theory, someone&#39;s passion, to spit out a disturbing amalgamation of material. This is not art. There is no humanity in this. Without the dedication and talents of human beings, none of this AI &quot;art&quot; would exist. The programs cannot create without stealing, therefore whatever it produces is not something that can be owned.<br/><br/>Our society is not set up in a way where the rise of AI will be handled with grace. Countless jobs will be slashed in favor of the cheaper &quot;good enough&quot; option of AI material. We cannot let it be copyrighted, we cannot let AI models become more skilled at the expense of real people. Companies using AI datasets should be held liable or be banned from training their system with people&#39;s work without permission. <br/><br/>Give artists, voice actors, writers, musicians and other creatives a fighting chance to keep their livelihoods and passion alive.
