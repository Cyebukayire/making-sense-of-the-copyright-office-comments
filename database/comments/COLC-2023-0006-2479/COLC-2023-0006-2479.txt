As an illustrator I do not wish to have my art used in AI generators without my permission and consent and compensation for my hard work and hours spent training.  Tens of thousands of dollars I spent on my art school education being flushed away because people want to use artists hard work to play with AI without considering that we weren&#39;t consulted and we weren&#39;t paid.
