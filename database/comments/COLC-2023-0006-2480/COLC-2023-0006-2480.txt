Given that AI-produced works are by their very nature derivatives of all the things that have been fed into them, I would hesitate in wanting sole credit be given to any AI-derived work without also giving credit to the underlying inputs. I&#39;ve seen a number of AI-created items which are unique in their arrangement of elements (both written and textual), but do not contain original elements. They are only reorganizing the things they have seen. I feel that if an AI tool is used, the proper crediting should be both to the tool (which is a unique algorithm in its own right) and to the underlying dataset, and if the dataset cannot be identified that does not speak well to the algorithm or the algorithm&#39;s user to properly give credit where credit it true.
