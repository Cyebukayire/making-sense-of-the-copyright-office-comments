Civilization should force a full stop to the advance of machine technology. It&rsquo;s up to the USA, as one of the main engines of artificial intelligence, to call a halt to the technocratic advance of systems about which we know so little. Systems that will have an immense impact of our lives and could alter human life forever.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;re talking about fundamental changes to the way we create and think; the way we arrive at what is true for us, what is true for our human civilization. The fullness of that civilization is built on the private movement and understanding reached by individuals through the free expression of their innermost ideas and thoughts. We are standing on the shoulders of the minds and hearts that came before us. We are a &ldquo;built&rdquo; civilization composed of a million flashes of genius; the woven tapestry of a million idiosyncratic threads.<br/><br/>Before we simply decide that machines are better at creating than we are, we should take a hard look at what it means to create something.<br/><br/>The technocrats think that creativity can be streamlined, flattened to an easily absorbable set of inputs and outputs, made to conform to a simplistic set of data points. Jeanne Fromer, professor of intellectual property rights at New York University, is a common example of someone who has no idea what making art requires. In a New York Times article she says that artists are &ldquo;often copying things and they&rsquo;re consuming lots of existing artwork and learning patterns and pieces of the style and then creating new artwork. And so at a certain level of abstraction, you could say machines are learning to make art the same way.&rdquo;<br/><br/>That is not how creativity works.<br/><br/>&ldquo;An artist is an explorer. He has to begin by self-discovery and by observation of his own procedure. After that he must not feel under any constraint.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash; Henri Matisse<br/><br/>Creative expression begins with a journey into our private inner worlds. The shaping and refining of our psyches, the struggle for clarity and the effort needed to bring our ideas to life are the real price of living a creative existence. Artists are not looking for &ldquo;patterns and pieces.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re looking for a fundamental way to make sense of it all and we do that through a complex process of choosing what is right and good for ourselves and our communities. We&rsquo;re not just &ldquo;consuming new artwork&rdquo; like automatons. We&rsquo;re feeding on the mythological and archetypal corpus of humanity, reading the subtle signs of what it means to be human. We&rsquo;re deciding moment by moment how to be fully alive and we&rsquo;re making those choices visible through our work.<br/><br/>Aristotle said that &ldquo;knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.&rdquo; I would add that knowledge is an intellectual pursuit, but wisdom can only be attained through living, by being fully attuned to our senses and our intuition. Making art is an important pathway to wisdom. It requires us to draw on all our resources &mdash; critical thinking yes but also an immersion into the realm of our senses and our imaginations.<br/><br/>Creativity is not about profit, which is what the machine engineers would like to make it about. They have stolen the intellectual property of the world, scraping it from the internet and hoarding it in their large language systems like little Ebenezer Scrooges on cocaine. They would like us to think that text can be made into images and images can be sold like widgets. They would like us to believe that creativity is just a reduction of the world&rsquo;s knowledge to easily consumable, commodifiable parts.<br/><br/>One of the reasons art is so little valued in our consumer society is that art cannot be easily quantified unless it&rsquo;s converted into consumer goods and assigned a price tag. The developers of ai benefit when the assignment of price is the most important marker of the creative process. But it&rsquo;s not. Not even close. By the time we see the end result of an artist&rsquo;s lifetime of work and struggle on the walls of museums and galleries, we are only looking at a piece of the puzzle of the human psyche.<br/><br/>The process of creating is as important as the product.  <br/><br/>We are voyagers on this planet. What we are looking for is a direct experience of connection to ourselves, our fellow humans, other species and the world at large. Our understanding of these connections is directly reflected through our creative endeavors. Machines would short circuit this process, loosening the bonds of relationship and substituting them with the cold star of efficiency, ease and speed.<br/><br/>
