I&rsquo;ve been a working professional artist for the last 16 years. Like any skill, art requires time, dedication, and lots of practice. I&rsquo;ve devoted my entire adult life to the pursuit of my art career and have achieved some moderate success working online and with several galleries. I was angered to find images of my work in the AI database; images of my art were taken without my consent, with no compensation or credit given to me, and they were used to fuel programs that other people are profiting from. Generative AI programs would not function without the images they were &ldquo;trained&rdquo; on, and sometimes the copies are so blatant that you can still see the artist&rsquo;s warped signature in the image. Generative AI is not &ldquo;just a tool,&rdquo; it steals past work from artists and then is used to directly compete with them for future projects. But if you remove all that stolen work from the data set, the programs wouldn&rsquo;t even work. It&rsquo;s pretty clear at this point that generative AI programs require human ingenuity to keep the results passable, and the generated content is severely lacking in quality when that resource is removed. These programs are a slap in the face to every creative professional. They are clearly exploitative, and if they are allowed to continue unregulated, then we may as well stop pretending to have any rules about copyright or intellectual property.
