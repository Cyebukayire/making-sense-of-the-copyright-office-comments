Thank you for opening this topic up to the public. I am an amateur author and artist myself, hoping to break into the field and a supporter of professional authors and artists, that is, those who&#39;s livelihood depends on their work. There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.  While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.  To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies. The Copyright Office should adopt the position that training AI on copyrighted works without the permission of the author or artist is a violation of the Copyrights Act. Thank you for your time and interest in this matter.
