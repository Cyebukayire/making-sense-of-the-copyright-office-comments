As someone who creates visual art, I&#39;m very concerned with the copyright violation/outright theft of my intellectual property in order to &quot;train&quot; computer algorithms. Simply put, the only way that a &quot;A.I.&quot; can be used to ethically generate images is if it has been trained exclusively on images made for that purpose, or with the express permission from the creator/copyright holder of that image. And right now, there exists no such &quot;A.I.&quot;. They&#39;re all trained off of images scraped from the internet, with no consent or compensation from the thousands of artists whose work was sampled. Morally and ethically, so-called &quot;generative A.I.&quot; programs are industrial-scale theft/plagiarism.<br/>And this is to say nothing of the thousands of real artists whose jobs are at risk of being replaced by these plagiarism programs.Or the staggering ecological damage training them causes. Were it not so destructive it would almost be impressive how utterly lacking in *any* redeeming qualities this software possesses.
