I do not think anyone should be able to profit from AI created or AI derived works. All AI created and AI derived works are trained on other artwork, writing, video, etc. and often you can even see the remnant of watermarks from the artist that the AI was trained on in its works. <br/>The artists, authors, and other creators who made the works that the AI is trained on did not consent to their works being used and do not receive compensation for it.<br/>AI works cannot be trusted to be accurate in the things they make. This can be shown when a lawyer tried to use an AI to make their argument and it cited several cases that did not exist. It cites research papers that do not exist. The artwork it makes is fundamentally flawed and that can be seen in the fingers, hair, background plants, and other errors it makes. Because an AI as they currently exist does not think. It does not know anything. It just spews out an amalgamation of the content it has absorbed that has internal tags that seem to best fit the query.<br/>Furthermore, as the AI bot stays active for longer, it starts to train itself on its own results, causing it to deviate further and further from what may have previously been a mostly correct answer/result.<br/>AI bots as they exist should not be used in any capacity in professional or commercial spaces. It is an interesting toy at best, not something qualified to make actual artwork, literary work, videos, papers, etc.
