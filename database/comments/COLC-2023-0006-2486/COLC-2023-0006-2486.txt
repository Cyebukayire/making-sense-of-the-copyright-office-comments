I am a children&#39;s book illustrator who has spent the last 9 years freely sharing my work online to build community, meet like-minded people, and just give viewers a bit of serotonin they may have needed that day. When I originally learned about copyright protections for artwork in the US, I was relieved to hear that it was lifetime of artist + 70 years, with additional protections in lawsuits if the artist had copyrighted it with the office. We need copyright protection to step up for artists whose works were used without permission to feed AI learning. It needs to uphold the history of acknowledging that people have the right to not have their creations stolen.
