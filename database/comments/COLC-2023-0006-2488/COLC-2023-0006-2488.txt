I am an author who relies on the income that my work generates for me and I am deeply concerned about how generative AI is being trained on copyrighted materials without the copyright owner&#39;s knowledge or consent.<br/>While a work is under copyright, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI because it violates the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.<br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.
