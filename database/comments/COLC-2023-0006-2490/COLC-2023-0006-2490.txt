I am a professional fine artist and illustrator and have maintained my career for the last 20 years by developing my craft and consistently producing high-caliber work. Over this time, I have uploaded numerous artworks to the internet through my website, social media, and portfolio sites. My intention was to cultivate an audience as an independent artist and connect with potential supporters who would appreciate my work.<br/><br/>The ability for an artist, and that artist alone, to control the copyright and usage of their work is essential. Many of my peers are facing unfair competition from AI generated imagery that is based on their work. Their work has been scraped (without compensation for this use) from the internet and now is being pushed down in search engine results by pale imitators. Those in the industry can identify the differences between original and AI imagery, but that gap is closing. The general public is more easily tricked and thus artists are in direct competition with work created to mimic their work, shaped and crafted after thousands of hours of practice and sweat &amp; tears. The right to create derivative work lies with the copyright holder. While style is not currently protected, laws that govern this were not written for the circumstances we currently face. Those laws do not imagine an algorithm that could instantaneously churn out competing imagery that dilutes the value of truly original human artwork at the click of a button.  <br/><br/>The industry is witnessing a decline in job opportunities as companies opt for AI-generated images instead of commissioning independent artists who struggle to support themselves. This situation raises the question of why any of us should continue to create and share our art, only to have it extracted and employed as training data without our consent, potentially diminishing our creative presence. What motivation remains to persevere in such circumstances? Isn&#39;t the fundamental purpose of copyright to empower creators to determine how their work is used and to receive fair compensation for it?<br/><br/>As a professor of illustration at a public university, I advise my students on a career in the arts. My students are concerned that generative AI will overshadow their creative contributions, and make finding early career-defining jobs all but impossible. They question the purpose of pursuing a career in art if their creations are destined to be consumed and potentially turned against them. The uncertainty of whether there will be a viable illustration career in the future looms large.<br/><br/>US Copyright Office, you hold the responsibility to safeguard a creative community, much like me, who have dedicated their entire lives to honing their craft, managed to sustain their livelihoods, support their families, and consistently contribute to innovation, inspiration, and the betterment of humanity. I hope to reassure my students that a viable career path awaits them upon graduation, enabling them to join a lineage of artists who have enjoyed generations of meaningful careers.<br/>
