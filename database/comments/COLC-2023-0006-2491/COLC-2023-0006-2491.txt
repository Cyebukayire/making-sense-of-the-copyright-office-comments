Courtney Birnbaum, a writer, reader, educator and animation production coordinator: AI should not be protected under copyright. It&rsquo;s not a human creation but instead a tool to recycle ideas into something, a sort of jumping off point to begin creation of a work at best and plagiarism at worst. If Public Domain is meant to make works accessible for use when the author has ceased to need financial reward for their own work (on account of death), so too must AI produced work remain Public Domain, for computers do not need wages, nor should companies profit off the work of countless others&rsquo; efforts who will not be fairly compensated after their works were used to train the algorithms.
