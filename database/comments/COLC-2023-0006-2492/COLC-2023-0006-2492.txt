AI art is something completely unnecessary since art is supposed to be a human extension from the soul. The machine lacks of the empathy and feelings to understand the thinking behind an illustration besides the technical side. Art is supposed to be a a craft and not something that should be completely automated. The machine scrapped millions of images with copyright and doesn&#39;t have the same image processing as human haves with art references.AI is faking the most human artistic skills a person haves: the skill of create music, the skill skill of  create illustrations, the skill of act and the skill of writing.And nothing is created by its own. It created thanks to millions of uncredited artists who aren&#39;t aware of the use of their artworks without their consent and who also aren&#39;t paid for it. Ai is completely killing the most humane expression of the soul, and it&#39;s forcing people to give up about their art and their goals since a machine can do it better than them at some extent. The only people who are compensated by this are the rich ones who doesn&#39;t care about creativity, who are making money at expense of actual artists.
