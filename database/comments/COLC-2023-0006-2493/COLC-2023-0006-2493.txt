Hi, good day and thank you in advance for reading this. I&#39;m not a professional artist, so i can only speak as a consumer. I believe the creative industry is in serious trouble, and it needs someone to intervene in all this mess, copyright protections should be enforced on anyone trying to infringe them, doesn&#39;t matter if they do it with the poor excuse of &quot;the advancement of humanity&quot;. I&#39;m sure AI technology has the potential for good use in the future, but not in the present, or at least not in their current form. Please don&#39;t allow the normalization of theft, don&#39;t allow people with ill-intentions to have the ability to replace and discard other people like garbage. Please don&#39;t ignore and pretend not to see all the damage that is already causing, and the potential it has to become worse. AI outputs should not be able to be protected as they are now, and AI scraping should not be allowed to continue infringing on the copyright and privacy of others. Thank you for your hard work.
