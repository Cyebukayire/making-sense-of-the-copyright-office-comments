Hello, <br/>My name is Sandra Fremgen. I have been an illustrator and designer in the gift industry for the past 18 years. I have designed commerical products like greeting cards, dinnerware, garden flags, rugs and anything that makes a great housewarming gift. My products have appeared in stores such as Barnes and Noble, Macy&#39;s Michael&#39;s Arts &amp; Crafts and TJ MAXX.<br/>As a working artist, I am not completely against AI. AI is a tool, just like any computer program. I have used AI technology to do the tedious tasks of my job (such as removing stray marks on artwork, extending the size of my artwork). However, I am concerned about people just being able to generate artwork with MidJourney and just pass it off as their own.  <br/>MidJourney (and other AI art programs) is a great way to brain storm ideas. It&#39;s the equivalent of going on google or pinterest to collect images to inspire your ideas.  However, the art generated shouldn&#39;t be copywritable. It shouldn&#39;t be allowed for commerical use. Midjourney and other AI art programs need to allow artists to &quot;opt out&quot; of their programs. <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Sandra Fremgen
