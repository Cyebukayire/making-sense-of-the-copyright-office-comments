I have been an artist affected by the advent of Generative AI software applications. I was deeply disturbed when I saw the usage of platforms like Midjourney or Dall-E that used scraped images from the internet without the knowledge, consent, attribution, or compensation of artists and visual creators to profit from mass data theft. This technology is being used to exploit creative workers and diminish their earning and salary potential in order to amass wealth for a few private corporations. I believe this is causing and will continue to cause immense economic, emotional, and societal harm if these technologies are not properly regulated and workers adequately compensated for their labor. I plead for swift regulatory action to disgorge these unethical data sets of all the stolen images, and the requirement that these companies must seek permission, and provide appropriate compensation and attribution from artists to train their machine learning models. I would also implore Congress to require labeling of all synthetic media types to prevent mass disinformation and fraud campaigns that would harm democracy itself.
