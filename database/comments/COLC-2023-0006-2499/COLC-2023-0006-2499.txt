As far as I know, you can&rsquo;t copyright a stolen painting. If how these generators are made and function isn&rsquo;t through mass theft then I shudder to think what you do consider to be &ldquo;theft&rdquo;. Unless I completely misunderstand the way this country works, these machines should already not be allowed to exist in their current form by laws that are already set.
