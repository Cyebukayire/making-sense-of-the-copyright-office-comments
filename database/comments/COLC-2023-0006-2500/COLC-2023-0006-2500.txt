Hello, thank you so much for opening this up for public comment. I am an artist and author, and while I don&#39;t make a living off my work, it is still very important to me. Creators such as myself own our artwork, and it would go against copyright for others to be able to train AI on it without our permission. I believe the Copyright Office should adopt positions that using others works to train AI without the consent of the creator violates the Copyright Act. Thank you for considering these comments.
