As a visual artist and an author, the idea that artificial intelligence is able to take my work and spit it out into a new format without my consent is deeply concerning for me. My writing, in particular, is something that I am passionate about. It is an art form that drives my life in a way that I can&#39;t describe. If my work is protected from being stolen by other human beings and reused, then it should be protected in the same way from AI. The same should be said about my art. A human being who traced my portrait painting, or took a portion of my writing, and posted it as their own could be taken to court for copyright infringement, and I believe that the same approach should be taken for AI. <br/><br/>Of course, the question of who should be punished comes into play. Those who allow AI to roam the internet freely and steal from others should be held accountable for their programs. It is theft, plain and simple. AI creators have an obligation to give artists, authors, and anyone else who may be impacted, the freedom to opt out of AI if they so desire and to protect our personal work. Also, AI creations (things that are created solely with AI) should not be copyright eligible because, ultimately, there is a high chance that these creations were made thanks to the AI training on stolen content. Once we deal with the issue of stolen content, then there should be a conversation about copyright eligibility for AI creations. As of right now, AI art and literature is theft. End of story.<br/><br/>I implore lawmakers to put themselves in the shoes of people like me (people who stand to lose something if AI is allowed to continue without regulation). Our art is not something that can be picked apart by AI. It should be protected, as it always has been.
