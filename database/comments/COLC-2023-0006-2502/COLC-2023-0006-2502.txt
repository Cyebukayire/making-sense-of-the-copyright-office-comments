I am a fine artist and illustrator and am deeply concerned about the copyright issues surrounding ai based image generators trained on large data sets that include the copyrighted works of unconsenting artists and other creators. This is an understandably new place to make law but the foundation is that copyrighted works have been used without the consent of the copyright holders and art creators to make commercial works and other products. In addition to the copyright concerns, this amounts to a theft of time and developed expertise that has not been technologically possible until this point. In the past it was possible for someone to make a forgery or imitate the style of another creator. While the first case is illegal and the second is frowned upon at best, they were still limited by the time and effort of a human working to create those fakes and the number of people willing to do so, keeping the problem - which is indeed a problem - limited in scope. These generative ai programs trained on the works of unconsenting creators operate on an incalculably larger and faster scale, and threaten to put people out of work using their own time, effort, and personal development, while enriching others in unrelated fields.<br/><br/>Please recognize that these programs in their current states and trained on their current data sets are highly scaled and automated copyright violations.
