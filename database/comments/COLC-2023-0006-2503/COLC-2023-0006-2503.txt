They say the Ai is &ldquo;learning.&rdquo; But that is just a buzzword that allows them to get away with stealing from everyone indiscriminately. It is a machine without rights, it does not &ldquo;learn&rdquo; like we do, that is just the wording they use to get away with it&hellip; machines copy and extract. And store. Not learn.<br/>What it is really doing is EXTRACTING what they want, from intensely valuable, personal work and images they don&rsquo;t own, and then STORING it, storing our property INDEFINITELY. And then using all of our data collectively against our interests. That is nothing like &ldquo;learning&rdquo;. It is more akin to making data-based copies, and allowing all of its users to use this &ldquo;infinite copying machine&rdquo; they&rsquo;ve created, without end.<br/><br/>And every time it is used, these millions and millions of images it produces constantly, devalues the original victims further. A multi-tiered, insidious, greedy. repeating crime that makes artists and designer&rsquo;s situations worse every day.<br/><br/>The only rational conclusion is that it is not only sinister, it represents the worst exploitations of capitalism: dishonest, unethical, unlawful, and overall, a weapon used by the tech sector that inflicts constant and repeated damage against the creative class. The very people it stole from in the first place. First the theft, then the constant, repeated weaponization. The world has never seen a crime of this nature.
