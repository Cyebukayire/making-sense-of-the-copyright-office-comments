I believe that a society&#39;s culture is a society&#39;s soul. I believe art is the foundation of a society&#39;s culture. I believe art requires a human soul to create. I believe that too many people rely on creative endeavors to make a living in a country where making a living is already becoming too difficult a thing. I believe that any piece of media that has had any kind of input from any kind of AI should be ineligible for copyright. Full stop. We need to protect workers and the soul of our society. Imagine a generation of children raised on nothing but procedurally-generated entertainment... The only parties that stand to gain from the proliferation of AI in entertainment are the giant corporations that WILL use it to replace the human creators they have historically relied on and had to compensate for their efforts. Those giant corporations already get enough help and consideration. Thank you for allowing public comment on this issue and I hope you do the right thing for the human beings in your constituency.
