While I am not a resident or citizen of the United States of America, I believe the U.S. Copyright Office can help set broad precedents for the Western world in its decision-making concerning AI and copyright, and I feel it is in the worldwide public interest therefore to submit this.<br/><br/>I believe that AI-generated work of whatever form (text, image, sound, video, etc) should not be granted copyright protection. The prevailing basis on which AI rests requires data set inputs that involve human-generated works that are re-mixed and re-used in ways that do not, in my view, rise to the level of true originality akin to a computer being given solely an English dictionary of words and their meanings and outputting valid original text according to the rules of English grammar, to use one example.<br/><br/>Further, even if a computer could truly produce original works of art (be it visual, print, or auditory) I still would argue that this does not satisfy the &#39;original work by a human being&#39; test.<br/><br/>However, on the flip side, I do not believe that the generation/scraping of data sets for AI models (ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, etc) is an act of copyright infringement. If AI-generated works cannot receive copyright protection, then their use in creating what are essentially derivative works is equally not capable of being an act of infringement by reason of &#39;scraping&#39; data sets from around the World Wide Web.<br/><br/>That said, I completely agree with the right of private parties who operate websites whose data could form the basis for AI works to restrict access to AI models on any basis they care to choose, and would thus suggest that provision of data sets for AI models should be on a completely voluntary opt-in basis insofar as this touches on any possible copyright implications.
