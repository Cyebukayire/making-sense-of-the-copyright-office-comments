I am a SAG-Elegible voice actor that is currently narrating multiple series for NYT Best Seller and similar authors. My voice is constantly at risk of being stolen. As a 100 percent disabled Army veteran, there are only so many careers my body can support. If my voice is copied without my permission, what other outlets do I have to support my family and express myself in a healthy way. I&#39;ve sacrificed years of effort, and this is the only way I being income to my family. Please don&#39;t let this theft continue unchecked to ruin lives.
