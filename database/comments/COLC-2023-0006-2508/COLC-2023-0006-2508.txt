GAI is damaging to the artistic progress and exploration of the human experience by only creating derivative representations without an enriched perspective to provide authentically original content. No worked created in such a way should allow copyright because the works themselves are an amalgamation of current interpretations dependent soley on collective user input. Meaning that all works created are owned equally by anyone who has participated at any point  with internet queries from the databases these programs have used to collect data. Making all works the property of the public, not a sole copyrightable entity.
