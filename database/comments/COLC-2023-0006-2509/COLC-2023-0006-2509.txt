I have already had both wages lost in form of my hours being cut in favor of AI, as well as someone using AI to strip my YouTube channel and split our videos into shorts to post on tiktok and make money without compensating me. <br/>If we don&rsquo;t limit or preferable criminalize and destroy generative AI, we&rsquo;ll lost 50% of jobs in the next 5 years. All office jobs, sales jobs, customer service, design work etc will all be outsourced and we will be forced to live off of the government and become a bigger problem for them.
