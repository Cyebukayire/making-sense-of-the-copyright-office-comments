It&rsquo;s highly unethical and dangerous to human way of life to let AI companies &amp; Big Tech make the important choices on  our arts and cultures and worst yet, our livelihoods. As a college student and musician these decisions and worldview worry me, Silicon Valley has done many questionable things in the past and have been allowed to continue because of the argument &ldquo;the benefits outweigh the risks&rdquo;, what if that is not the case this time? These companies/entities are too gung-ho on trampling on civilians lives to create their idea of &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; before even asking what people thought about it or if they wanted to be apart of it. Arts &amp; Culture are human creations for human expression, they should be left alone from corporate greed and machine automation. <br/><br/>
