My name is Dini Luna. I am currently in my first year as a full-time art student fulfilling my dreams, but I feel like my goals are becoming a mere pipe dream. I am a professional freelance illustrator and have been working towards being part of as many highly-beloved industry projects as I can for the past 6 years. Seeing the rise of AI completely annihilate the jobs of my peers is nothing short of soul-shattering. Not only have I accrued debt for a potentially useless degree, I feel as though my hard work and imagination is no longer valued. As someone who has built a loyal following by posting my work online, I no longer feel safe doing so because the next person can generate it and call it their own.<br/>There are thousand of human artists in many fields, but AI continues to eradicate the collective visual entertainment industry as we know it, thus leaving said artists homeless or very close to it. Not only is the use of genAI extremely unethical, the images created cannot be copywritten because they do not contain human authorship nor consent from the real artists themselves. <br/>I used to dream of being able to sustain myself comfortably and happily with my work while contributing my joy of creativity to the world, but I am now currently considering severely less-passionate avenues in order to make a living while the AI users get off scott-free. There was always enough room for all artists to thrive in this world, but that is now no longer the case, where we literally have to compete with ourselves with absolutely everything to lose.<br/>
