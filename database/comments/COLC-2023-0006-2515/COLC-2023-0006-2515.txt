<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI enthusiasts also like to claim that the results of AI are legitimate because &quot;neural networks work the same way as a brain.&quot; This is not true. Humans learn creative skills and take inspiration from things they experience. AI &quot;learns&quot; by building a massive statistical function from millions of pre-existing works. The material that AI&#39;s train on is harvested without consent or compensation&mdash;essentially, it&#39;s stolen data. The AI then uses the patterns it&rsquo;s learned from this data to drop pixels or text into a similar pattern. There is no learning, no human insight or creativity in the process. A user puts in a prompt and then the transformer algorithm spews out a result based on the math model, trying to approximate what it&#39;s seen before. Users are now asking for copyright protection for something they did nothing to create. They&rsquo;re microwaving a hotpocket and then expecting a 5 star rating from Restaurant Magazine.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Computers have always been better at mass production than humans. Deep Mind beat Garry Kasparov at chess back in 1997. Anyone who plays computer games knows how much better the computer is at the game&mdash;it can think 10 million times faster. As an author, it takes me about 2 years to write a book. The moment I share the idea on my Twitter, some AI user can put the idea into their generator and have a finished book in a couple of hours. They can rip off my work faster than I can create it. Meanwhile, they&#39;re asking for copyright on something they put no creative energy into. They could also destroy my work before I&rsquo;ve even thought of it: if AI is given copyright protection, there&rsquo;s nothing to stop dedicated users from generating and then copyright massive datasets of random ideas and then suing individual creators who come up with similar ideas. This is something that already happens in the patent world, and could be much worse for media with the use of generators that can run 24/7.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Please do not give in to the big scam corporations pushing generative AI as the next big world-changing technology. This tech is built by companies that have blatantly disregarded copyright protections for the people whose work ha gone to feed their datasets. It&#39;s being used by people who happily rip off and demean the work of human artists, despite having no skills of their own. Users are building pushbutton products built of bits and pieces of work they&#39;ve stolen from actual humans, claiming they should get exclusive rights to the Frankensteined results of their prompts. Extending copyright protection to these grifters would be an insult and a crushing blow to millions of artists around the world who have devoted their lives to furthering humankind&#39;s culture, artists whose work is being indiscriminately scraped to generate profits for corrupt CEOs. Copyright should require significant human input and effort. Generative AI should not receive this protection.
