I am a semi-professional illustrator based in Indonesia, a developing country. For me, art has always been one of the few career paths which may provide fulfillment and reasonable livelihood due to low living cost in my country (I take commissions from overseas clients who pays in US Dollars). Since the advent of generative AI on creative fields, prominently AI-generated imagery back in August-October 2022, I have been riddled with anxiety with my livelihood and indeed, my identity moving forward.<br/><br/>As you may know, the path of professional illustrators require years of dedicated learning and posting online to build portfolio and following. The rise of generative AI has unfortunately trampled on both of those. The sheer ease of generating an image with only texts (and for savvier users; technologies and techniques such as ControlNet and LoRA, which allows more precise fine-tuning for closer as-desired results) made the skills I&#39;ve spent most of my life learning seem obsolete. Furthermore, while I personally haven&#39;t felt it thanks to a full-time job (which I feel may also be under threat of AI), I have seen accounts from other professionals in the field, as well as closer acquaintances, that their business have been impacted in high likelyhood by AI.<br/><br/>More significant still is the issue of identity. If one were to ask an experienced illustrator whether they associate their art with themselves, they likely would say yes. This is due to the aforementioned years of dedication and experimentation required of an illustrator, which in turn make the result of such dedication - their art, in particular, how they look; the &quot;artstyle&quot; - a part of their identity. The aforementioned techniques in generative AI such as LoRA is specifically developed to &quot;fine-tune&quot; results of generative AI, usually towards a desired artstyle. This is done by essentially feeding the algorithm with sample images of a particular artstyle the user wants the AI to mimic in its output. Such images are, of course, obtained freely - in this case from an artist&#39;s page - as it should. Yet in this case it is exploited in bad faith by AI users without permission.<br/><br/>The primed AI, equipped with an &quot;understanding&quot; of an artist&#39;s artstyle, is then told to output images as the AI user - not the artist - desire. From more materials like the original artist create (thus devaluing the work of the artist, and impact business), to generating images with messaging that the artist do not condone. As an artist, this feels like identity theft, followed by gross misappropriation of said stolen identity. A lot of AI proponent would equate this to the advent of Photoshop and existence of talented impersonators, yet fail to understand that creating convincing impersonations using Photoshop or otherwise requires its own set of skills, so much that it can be said that it&#39;s its own category of work of art. Said proponents also typically refuse to cease and take down a LoRA trained on an artist&#39;s artstyle on request, citing &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;democratization&quot; of the arts, which I think is extremely short-sighted because they fail to consider that with AI capabilities, creatives or indeed - anyone, will be punished for innovating, as generative AI will be (and already able to) replicate it to an acceptable degree.<br/><br/>Ergo, there&#39;s a very high barrier of entry with using Photoshop competently. Such barrier is very low to almost non-existant with generative AI, allowing almost everyone with the slightest savviness of computers to essentially &quot;steal&quot; an artist&#39;s &quot;voice&quot; and use it however they like. In some cases, quite literally. As I&#39;m writing this comment this morning, an article published by Fortune, titled &quot;Actor Stephen Fry says his voice was stolen from the Harry Potter audiobooks and replicated by AI&mdash;and warns this is just the beginning,&quot; told a snapshot of what generative AI is capable of, even to the most prolific of creatives out there. When the currently-striking SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said AI &ldquo;poses an existential threat&rdquo; to creative industries, I am inclined to believe and support the statement. It is the reason why I am taking my time during my break to write this comment, from half a world away, so that you may consider that this will not only impact the people of the United States, but also everyone else in the world. I truly wish I was exaggerating.<br/><br/>I would like to thank the US Copyright Office again for this opportunity to comment, and please forgive my shortcomings in English as it only my second language.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time in reading this.
