AI writing tools used in story production output can be copyrighted if the writer can prove that a human guided the tools to create the story. Each person&#39;s input into the AI tool to produce prose for the story provides a unique combination of variables that changes the story output. Writers should be prepared to provide the inputs used to create the story and the original tool output. This evidence will show what the AI tools provided and how the published output differs. <br/><br/>The uniqueness of the input should ensure the uniqueness of the generated prose. Similar to using development and line editors to modify your drafted story for a publisher, others have input to your story that is deemed copyrightable by the author only, in current standards. <br/><br/>In the AI writing tool Sudowrite, the creator provides inputs down to the beats of a chapter. The more the creator provides (to a point), the closer the generated prose will be to what the creator desires. Requiring fewer rewrites of the resulting prose. The links below are to my blog, where I described how I used Sudowrite in creating the first chapters of a story. Please forgive me, but I could not figure out how to export the blog posts into a clean copy for attachment upload.<br/>https://jegrimm.wordpress.com/2023/07/27/using-an-ai-writing-tool/<br/>https://jegrimm.wordpress.com/2023/07/31/using-ai-writing-tools-part-2/<br/>https://jegrimm.wordpress.com/2023/08/16/using-ai-writing-tools-part-3/<br/><br/>I list my inputs and some resulting generated outputs to create the prose for the chapters mentioned in the posts. I still have to edit the output to get it to where I want the story to go, but there are some decent passages created by the AI tool. <br/><br/>How does this benefit a creator such as myself? It allows the creator to follow &quot;What if&quot; scenarios in the story that might have taken much longer to write out. If the creator wants to consider different ways to have two characters meet, they can guide the AI tool to produce draft prose for different scenarios and then select the one they are happy with or share with others for their input. If a human was to do this alone, especially if they planned on seeking advice, they would have to write up each scenario&#39;s prose or summary.<br/><br/>In the end, I believe allowing the use of AI tools in copyrighted material can improve the quality of stories by allowing the creator to develop alternative storylines and choose the most appropriate to their envisioned storyline.<br/><br/>Thank you.
