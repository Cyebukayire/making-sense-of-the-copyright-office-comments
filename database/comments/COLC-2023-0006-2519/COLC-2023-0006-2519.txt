Ai in it&#39;s current form is complete theft and breaking of all our copyright laws. It breaks our right to privacy with our data. It breaks our right to not have our names and copyrighted artwork, photos, private information, and our property rights. The Ai companies have taken everything from the web with a &quot;Non Profit&quot; research license and are now turning around and making profit with our data that was harvested solely for the purpose originally for robotics and self driving cars, but is now breaking all pillars of fair use by directly competing with the original copyright owners making infinite derivative works with our very own data. Copyright is designed to stop this kind of thing from being allowed to happen, but out of pure legal grey area and confusion people have so far given it a pass. The diffusion technique the companies are saying they are using to dissolve the images into noise and then generate these images is a big lie. CD encoding works just like this, you take data that&#39;s in one form and then transform it into another form it&#39;s still copyrighted and protected. When a song is recorded, put onto a CD, then turned into an MP3, that data file still has copyright, even though it&#39;s in another form. I know it&#39;s confusing but the &quot;AI&quot; is just able to see and identify all the small pieces of the images and put them all back together, like a puzzle, but this puzzle is like turning pieces of sand back into one image. The human mind couldn&#39;t put back together a sand puzzle, but these machines are experts at doing it in seconds. Yet again, our data is inside their machines, they are breaking our copyrights using it, it doesn&#39;t matter how they said they got there. A good breakdown question to ask is, how useful is one of these Ai&#39;s without our copyrighted data inside it? Answer is useless. Without what I would call the biggest data breach in history, these &quot;Ai&#39;s&quot; are absolutely nothing. This system is also only economically possible through massive theft as well, if they had to sit down and negotiate every single artists rights for every image they used, they wouldn&#39;t think this is cheap at all to do. But it might have been possible to help Artists share in the profits by giving Artists either percentages of sales, or working out a system that charges the customers money for any given Artist style that&#39;s being used or present, but the Ai companies have refused to even acknowledge Artists existence. They have done nothing but gaslight Artists this entire year and even to this day refuse to publicly admit that Artists exist, that this technology has stolen from us, and that it&#39;s harming us in our fields that it&#39;s being stolen from. I wouldn&#39;t touch this technology with a 1,000 foot pole, it&#39;s hot, it&#39;s stolen goods and needs to be regulated heavily. You know what&#39;s funny? I would tell you to regulate mass data scraping so that it&#39;s only used for &quot;research only purposes&quot; but you know what? That&#39;s already the law! They broke that! Also I have gone through lines of data scraping laws in California and it&#39;s stated that it&#39;s illegal for any company using scraped data to disclose who&#39;s names are in the data. That&#39;s a huge privacy violation in California law and a mishandling of peoples private data. Well guess what people have to do when they type in an artists name inside the prompts of one of these Ai generators? It&#39;s disclosing to the public our names to the public that they have our private data. As I said earlier, that&#39;s a huge break of California data scraping laws to disclose our names inside these Ai generators. To finalize what I am saying, Ai in it&#39;s current form is the biggest data breach in history, it&#39;s the largest copyright and privacy violation of all time, it&#39;s a complete pillaging of the internet and is completely against a free and open internet that would be safe to use. This is not the way, this is not the future.
