AI technology allows companies to have an easier way to exploit and displace workers. By plagiarizing, stealing and copying work from creatives to doctors, AI &quot;works&quot; are completely derivative and if left unchecked, could create a legal entanglement .  AI can lead to many safety concerns, such as creating child pornography or making medical decisions based on circumstantial evidence only. This technology must be heavily regulated to become ethical, requiring consent from creatives and should outright be banned for medical or &quot;risky&quot; procedures.
