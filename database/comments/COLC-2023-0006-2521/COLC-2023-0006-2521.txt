As a disabled artist, I&#39;m terrified of what AI art will mean for the future of my career. Because of my condition, my employment options are few and I can only rely on my 20+ years of art experience for income. I may never find consistent work as an artist if my skill is being replaced by the regurgitation of stolen work. There is no ethical use of AI art if the datasets consist of millions of unauthorized works. The pieces produced through these systems are almost always plagiarized carbon copies of the work of actual artists, with about as much distinction as a camera filter. The proponents of AI art insist that the programs &quot;learn&quot; like human artists do, but this is falsified by the fact that AI art deteorates in quality and cohesiveness when trained upon its own work. It cannot produce art without the input of unwilling human hands. This is theft, repackaged and sold to people who don&#39;t want to pay artists the value of their work. There is no ethical way of utilizing a tool trained on stolen art. This is true for visual art, writing, music, voice acting, and any other artistic or performing role that requires the skill and experience of a human being. Stolen work is being regurgitated out of the data sets for a convenience fee as actual human artists are losing work opportunities and struggling to make ends meet.
