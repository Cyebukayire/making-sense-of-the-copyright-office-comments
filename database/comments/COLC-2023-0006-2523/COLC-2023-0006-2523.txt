I am a fine artist. I graduated with a bachelors degree in painting and drawing in 2012. I have been an artist my whole life. I create with my hands, my eyes, and my mind. We are surrounded by things that were created by humans from the phone you hold in your hands, to the car you drive, to the TV shows you watch, to the art you hang in your home. As an artist when I create a piece of artwork from my own eyes, hands, and mind it is uniquely my creation. As an artist I chose to share my artwork with my audience. If someone takes my artwork and calls it their own, that is plagiarism. If someone copies my artwork and calls it theirs own, that is plagiarism. AI art is plagiarism. If AI requires art to train its algorithm then artists should be compensated for their work. AI should not be allowed to use works not in the public domain to train their algorithms. Unless artists are paid fairly for use of their artwork. Thank you.
