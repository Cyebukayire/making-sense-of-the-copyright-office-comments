Freelance artist here. I think the use of others&#39; art to train AI, without explicit permission and without a specific purpose/project the AI is designed for (i.e. calculating 2D lines on top of 3D animation a la Spiderverse, or Photoshop&#39;s content aware fill, as opposed to just generating any random prompt) is horrific, even if the company training the AI only uses their own IP, as the use of AI was not in any prior contracts. The employees and contractors of these companies will see no compensation for that. The same way I&#39;d charge much more for a commission intended for commercial use, I&#39;d expect artists to charge exponentially to have their work feed a machine and produce more content whenever the client wants. Training AI with art already completed robs us of that chance.<br/><br/>The only ethical way to train AI should be to hire artists to train them all from scratch with new pieces, or with previous pieces the artists offer.  Compensation for training an AI should be a lot, since the AI will be turning profit for potential years or decades.  Artists could even take a percentage of the AI&#39;s profits.<br/><br/>Having one person edit the output of an AI trained on stolen pieces is still art theft, as the most crucial and skill-demanding step, the actual making of art, is going uncompensated.  Having someone edit AI output that has been trained by entirely compensated artists, or artists who are earning a royalty... that, I could potentially understand.  The copyright would then belong to the company publishing the art and compensating everyone for making it.<br/><br/>If an AI&#39;s output is found to have been made with stolen material, I think the copyright should be stripped from whoever published it, and the victims of the theft should be allowed some course of pursuing compensation.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I just don&#39;t see AI as anything more than just an advanced photoshop algorithm.  You have to pay for the stock images and videos you use.  How exactly you will use those stock assets is outlined in a license or contract, and use outside of that will get you into trouble.  AI should work the same, or else its involvement should immediately nullify the copyright of any product.<br/><br/>AI, in its current state, is only trained on unfathomable amounts of stolen art and writing.  In its current state, the involvement of an AI in a project should nullify all its copyright.  We need to vastly change how we use and train AI before I&#39;d ever feel comfortable using or monetizing it.
