AI generated images are created using models trained on images created by artists, without the artist&rsquo;s consent. Companies deploying these AI generated image services are profiting directly by exploiting artists and infringing upon the copyright of their artworks without consent or compensation. These services could not exist or generate profit without this exploitation and stealing of images. <br/><br/>These companies profit off of artists work whilst simultaneously saturating the artist job market. The saturation of AI generated &lsquo;artworks&rsquo; of all internet platforms degrades art culture, which is significantly important to all creatives; whether they pursue creative endeavours professionally or otherwise. Degrading art culture threatens the richness of ALL of our lives.
