First of all, thank you for the opportunity to say my opinion.&nbsp;<br/>Copyright is to protect an author&#39;s work from exploitation. Generative Ai is based on a massive exploitation of real people&#39;s work and skills, sometimes their voices or likeness. Nobody asked them if this was fine, it was like a robbery. And they steal a very personal part of people&#39;s souls, that&#39;s why this robbery is so wrong.<br/>But even if we sanate these wrong bases, and we immagine to work with an ethical and fair Ai sistem, the point is that you will not create anything if a machine makes choices for you. Any kind of mind work is somehow a message from the author to all the other people, and that works for writing, painting, photography etc. When you create something you have to make choices, learn skills, try and try again. Even when you cheat or you take shortcuts, you&#39;re making choices.  <br/>The most modern tools for art or writing are just tools. If you take a picture you press a button but you have to find a place, find a light, find that a scene is meaningful for you. Even Photoshop is not automatized (or better an&#39;t), you have to look for your images, colors, and so on.&nbsp;<br/>A machine can output results, that&#39;s not creativity. The tricky point could be if I use this output as a base to work on, but I think it must be documentate in some kind of before/after effect.&nbsp;<br/>The huge number of works an Ai can produce in a short time could be another problem. Copyright is based on a human scale way of thinking, I think that open to AI generated material could crack the system in no time.<br/>Last but not least every failure, every attempt a person makes for producing something is something we learn. That will disappear if we mechanize creativity, and will be a terrible loss for everyone.<br/>Thank you again for reading me
