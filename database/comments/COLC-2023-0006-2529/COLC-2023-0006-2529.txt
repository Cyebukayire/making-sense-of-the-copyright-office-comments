<br/>    As far as using copyrighted materials for training AI, permission absolutely needs to be granted by the copyright holder in some capacity. For public sites where works are published (AO3, Wattpad, etc), it would be easy enough to incorporate a checkbox or permissions tab for posters to opt in or out of allowing their work to be fed to an AI. Compensation should be offered as well; the writing is being used in a capacity it was not originally designed for, and if training an AI means that copyright may be transferred or considered null due to its use, then the author(s) should be adequately compensated. If an AI is trained using copyrighted material but the copyright holder did not offer compensation or ask permission prior to use, the copyright holder(s) should be able to file a complaint and receive compensation as well as have their works removed from the AI&#39;s training modules. With regard to AI generated materials being copyrightable, I don&#39;t think they should be. They were trained using existing materials created by people, but even with human programming there is little to no human involvement in the creation. There was a court case about this where a gorilla or monkey took a photo using a photographer&#39;s camera, and the court ruled that the monkey could not claim ownership. This should also apply to AI. For attributes like style and likeness that aren&#39;t typically covered by copyright, there should still be rules preventing AI from copying these directly. <br/>I&#39;m personally against AI completely, but as it&#39;s something I can&#39;t escape I think it should be used as an assist for humans, not replace them. AI generated works should never replace human works. <br/>   <br/>
