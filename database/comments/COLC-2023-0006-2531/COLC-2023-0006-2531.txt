1. AI models or images they generate can&#39;t be reasonably considered copies or derivative works of copyrighted works used in AI training.<br/><br/>By design AI models can&#39;t contain copies of works used in training. An average contribution of an image for Stable Diffusion model is on order of 1-2 bytes of information.<br/><br/>Generative AI tools do not replicate works used in training. The rare exceptions are defects of model caused by over tuning. Image generators usually can reproduce something resembling Mona Lisa due to multiple copies of this picture present in any large enough set of random images from the Internet.<br/><br/>2. I think that usage of generative AI tools should not have any consequences for copyright registration.<br/><br/>I read CRB decision about Jason M. Allen&#39;s work.<br/><br/>The board rejected the registration because &quot;the Work contains more than a de minimis amount of AI generated content&quot;. This content was generated by Midjourney. No one claims copyright for this content. No one even knew the image existed before Mr. Allen sent it to USCO. It is not clear whose rights USCO protects in this case.<br/><br/>USCO presently relies on self reporting of AI tools usage because there is no reliable method of AI detection. AI is getting better, detecting it will be more difficult over time.<br/><br/>Presently USCO makes people chose between a honor of being honest with a state bureaucracy and money. Quite a few will chose money.<br/><br/>People have two main reasons to follow the law - because they believe in it and fear of retribution.<br/><br/>The law as it stands likely to be considered unjust by the artists who created their works with AI tools but can&#39;t benefit from it based on a nebulous idea of &quot;human authorship&quot;. Which protects them from unbearable horror of monkey holding a copyright on a picture no one cares about.<br/><br/>On the other hand USCO can&#39;t really effectively enforce the law as AI usage is undetectable.<br/><br/>It means this law will not work. Over time it will normalize lying to the state agencies which likely to have other unintended consequences (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_window_theory).<br/><br/>I think USCO should return to pre-AI methods of registration - if an image doesn&#39;t obviously copy other copyrighted work, grant a registration. If someone complains about it later let court decide if there is &quot;de minimis&quot; of copied work or not.<br/><br/>With generative AI integrated into Photoshop majority of commercial images soon likely to contain undetectable AI components which can&#39;t easily be described. Present USCO approach means lots of additional work both for authors and USCO without any discernible benefit for society.<br/><br/>Not a US citizen here. But US copyright likely to have global consequences. So, good luck guys/gals/*.
