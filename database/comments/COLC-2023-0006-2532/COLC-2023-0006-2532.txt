Generative AI is a direct threat to the livelihood of artists at a point in the field when our labor is already incredibly undervalued. The years of learning a craft, struggling to find a platform, and even more making a living are undercut by those who do no more than search our names along with added suggestions. AI is an insult to the foundation of art. To take the truth of the world and present it through one&#39;s own point of view and cannibalize it for the sake of cheap &quot;content&quot; for companies to use instead of paying a human with a craft and a vision is a dystopic endgame that even our most gifted science fiction writers would say is too on the nose. While we may not be able to put the AI genie back in the box, we need the government to take a stance and protect the already vulnerable group of artists who already break themselves to make a living from having their work stolen and repurposed while they themselves are discarded in favor of a magic &quot;Google Image&quot; search.
