Generative AI severely undermines human authorship. Even now, while the tool is still young, it is becoming harder to distinguish AI made works from human made works. This is a concerning issue that affects anything which requires human authorship to produce such as academia assignments, job applications, online information resources,  artworks, and much more. It is undeniable that AI is an incredibly powerful tool. However, there is an even greater responsibility to hold those using it accountable for the actions they perform. AI already poses many legal and ethical challenges. As AI is refined, those challenges are only bound to grow. Preparation now is key to battling the new challenges that will rise. Human authorship has always been historically important. Computers are powerful but they cannot, and should not, speak to humanity on the behalf of humanity. Please consider the potential of AI carefully. There are many amazing things it can do, but there are just as many harmful things it can produce in turn.
