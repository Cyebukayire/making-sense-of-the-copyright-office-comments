I&#39;m a writer, as in I&#39;ve been paid over the years to write things and had my own stuff published or published it myself. I&#39;m also an actor, though not nearly as much or for as long as I&#39;ve been a writer. Speaking as both, I absolutely have no desire for &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; to &quot;scrape&quot; my work, my voice, or my likeness in order to generate for free any level of direct imitation of or to even plagiarize my work and not to use my likeness or voice. I do not believe those who have developed, are still developing, and/or will further develop AI should be allowed to simply mine anything and everything and everyone in existence, past or present, to &quot;create&quot; and to &quot;create&quot; for the profit of others who don&#39;t create at all.
