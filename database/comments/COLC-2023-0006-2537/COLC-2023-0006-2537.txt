Hello, I am an office worker working on webtoon comics in South Korea.<br/><br/>I believe that many artists and experts have already provided the Copyright Office with many examples or evidence of how AI programs infringe copyright. (Check attached file #1)<br/><br/>I like to list a lot of evidence, but I want to focus on what risks are arising if the government tolerates or condones copyright infringement caused by ai such as stable diffusion and webui.<br/><br/>Currently, many creators in the United States have unfairly learned data due to ai, causing numerous damage, and I know that there is a lot of controversy in Hollywood due to the learning of face data by screenwriters and actors.<br/><br/>I know that many generative ai such as Chatgpt, Midzerney, Nijijourney, Stable Diffusion, and webui appeared and took data from creators in various fields without consent, resulting in a lot of lawsuits and legal arguments.<br/><br/>Korean content has also been robbed of data due to stable diffusion and webui, and there have been numerous moves to publicize the contents of these inappropriate copyright infringements.<br/><br/>But The Korean Government is condoning it due to its illusions about AI, and the same creators, the Korean writers, are actually advocating this violation of rights. This is because Korean-based AI programs have not yet appeared and I believe that high-quality data from other creative fields can be used for free. They are opposed to their own writing being learned by machine learning, but are actively advocating for intrusion into other creative industries.<br/><br/>Korean companies are currently forcing creators to make unfair sacrifices, similar to the strike by Hollywood actors and screenwriters. <br/>They are attempting to model data from the company unconditionally without consent, and are also attempting to monetize data models created in foreign countries with copyright issues by lying that they developed them themselves. Additionally, the platforms do not provide any notice. It also appeared that they were trying to take the data uploaded by creators by changing the terms and conditions without notice.<br/><br/>When artists point out these issues, they are ridiculed as being left behind by the times, and large-scale cyberbullying is often attempted to ask for the truth. There are many communities that work systematically to justify their copyright infringement. In the case of Japan and China, they do not hesitate to carry out extremely cruel acts such as death threats and leaking of personal information.<br/><br/>Due to these systematic infringements, dismissals, and cyberbullying, many talented artists are leaving the industry, and new artists with potential are trying to keep their work private or change jobs to other occupations. By not uploading work and deleting all uploaded work, it is gradually becoming a wasteland. AI picture sites and communities are currently becoming ghost sites where only uploads exist and no one is interested. <br/><br/>The funny thing is that people who infringe on these copyrights continue to try to enter sites and platforms where artists create their own works. Because places that only have AI art do not recognize its value,<br/><br/>There are many communities that steal data from various artist and create special models to monetize it. They claim to be against monetization, but it is virtually meaningless as there are many people who actually try to monetize with this model.<br/>https://arca.live/b/hypernetworks/60940948?target=all&amp;keyword=%EA%B3%B5%EC%9C%A0%EB%90%9C&amp;p=1<br/>https://arca.live/b/aiart?target=all&amp;keyword=%EB%AA%A8%EC%9D%8C&amp;category=%EC%9E%90%EB%A3%8C%EC%8B%A4<br/><br/>The issue of fake news is also serious, and many issues are being discussed in Korea as well. What is shocking is that deepfake abuse using web UI is occurring in the dark.<br/><br/>I understand that in Europe and the United States, politicians, experts, and artists are working together in each field to become aware of AI problems, share information about why it is a problem, and make efforts to establish regulations. If copyright infringement is condoned and tolerated without such discussion, we may witness horrendous scenes of infringement like the cases mentioned above.<br/><br/>I believe that after converting the original author&#39;s data into a data model using machine learning, it is highly inappropriate for a third party to claim rights or monetization just by writing down a prompt, and is a theft under the guise of new technology. In order for this kind of generated AI to work, it need data from numerous original authors, and I believe compensation must be provided.<br/><br/>In order to prevent copyright infringement and crime, I believe that AI program data should ensure transparency about what data was learned, and commercialization of non-consensual models should be prohibited.<br/><br/>Only by making the right choices will many countries be able to put an end to the madness. I hope you make the right choice. May God bless you<br/>
