I&#39;m a visual artist, painter and sculptor. I own the rights to all of my work and AI COPYING my work to regurgitate it as &quot;original work&quot; is a violation of my copyrights and my rights under the VARA, the Visual Artist Rights Act. There is no scenario where I would allow anyone to use my work in any way without my permission. This includes images of myself or my voice. The use of AI should be heavily regulated.
