Dear Sir/Madam,<br/><br/>As a creative person, generative AI poses a real and present threat to my ability to support myself from my creative ventures. When an artist bares their soul and puts that energy into a creative project, of course that energy can&#39;t be replicated. But our finished product becomes diminished when AI takes our intellectual property and reuses it to create something else. This is not &quot;fair use&quot; and should not be considered as such. This is THEFT. I would ask that you consider millions of Americans who may have to stop creating the art that we all enjoy on the screen, in books, on the stage and in so many other venues if we aren&#39;t able to make a living from doing this. We don&#39;t want a society where we are just fed whatever the algorithm tells us we want. Let people freely create, pay them for that work fairly and allow the consumer to choose.
