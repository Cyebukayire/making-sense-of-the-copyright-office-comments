Protect the copyrights of the actual artiest.  Allowing an AI model to use work created and copyrighted by an artiest to make something in &quot;the style of&quot; is using that artiest work without their consent.  Given the AI was trained on the work, whatever the AI generates would not exist if not for the content to stole from an artiest.  I work in the video game industry and AI presents a real threat to copyrighted content across the board.  Not only does this violate my companies ownership of our art/code/assets, but it allows other companies to steal our work without consequence.  Anyone could release a game based on the work our studio spent years working on - something that wouldn&#39;t be possible had they not trained their AI system on our content without any compensation or permission.  <br/><br/>On a more philosophical side, the idea of using something like AI to replace the artistic expression of humans is a real disservice.  We&#39;re not talking about automation of repetitive tasks, we&#39;re talking about the basic expression of human emotions - a fundamental part of the human experience.
