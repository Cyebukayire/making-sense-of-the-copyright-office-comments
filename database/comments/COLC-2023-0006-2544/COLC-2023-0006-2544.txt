A.I. threatens the livelihoods of more than just writers, performers, and artists; it threatens the livelihoods of every human on this planet - including politicians and bureaucrats, let&#39;s get real - who have jobs that can be &quot;easily&quot; done by A.I. And unless the United States Government is about to instate a high enough universal income to cover the ever-rising cost of living so people don&#39;t have to worry about those jobs, it is imperative that regulations are put into place now rather than rushing to catch up and thus be constantly behind. We Americans live in a consumerist society, but if the people aren&#39;t making enough money to live, much less consume, then this society will fall apart very quickly.<br/><br/>Generative A.I. in particular is worrisome; it&#39;s being trained on art that doesn&#39;t belong to the software or the people writing the code, they haven&#39;t paid to license that art, and all artwork that is put out by those programs and apps amount to theft, plain and simple. In addition, it was ruled that those works cannot be copyrighted as they&#39;re not created by human hands. There are cases of A.I. generated books being attributed to authors who didn&#39;t write them being put out by &quot;publishing companies&quot; that are making a mint off of these illegal pieces of art and the author who is being attributed is seeing nothing and has little recourse, particularly if they&#39;re self-publishing or with small presses.<br/><br/>If left unchecked, generative A.I., A.I. in general, and automated services will replace you, the one who has to sift through these public comments. It will replace your co-workers and bosses. It will replace your partner or spouse at their place of employment. Very few workplaces will remain untouched and you can&#39;t realistically have the entire citizenry work those handful of jobs. This has the potential to be the biggest existential crisis faced by the world since, well, the pandemic started and workers were put into harm&#39;s way in order to continue to make money, but weren&#39;t being paid commensurate with the danger, or the daily grind for that matter. People used to be afraid of their company shifting work to India or some other low wage country when the threat now is not even human. It&#39;s hard to compete with &quot;free&quot; labor when you&#39;re shortsighted.
