Hello and thank you for all of the work you do for the people. I am writing on behalf of actors, writers, and artists working in the entertainment industry. At this time, we are experiencing nothing short of an existential crisis in regards to the tech industry&#39;s use of generative Artificial Intelligence in our field of work. The manner in which generative AI (GAI) are trained includes the ingestion of millions of copyrighted works scraped from the internet. Copyright protects the ability to make a living for untold numbers of people. GAI models obliterate the protections your office has in place to protect our very livelihoods. GAI only functions in the way GAI executives desire when it is fed the original and protected works of hardworking creatives. They could train it on their journals and writings, but that is not of any interest to them, as they are without the training and talent necessary to create in the way that we do. It is nothing short of thievery. These companies are already making billions of dollars with a tech that does not function within our work. No consent or compensation has been offered to the hardworking artists who have spent our lives developing these skills. It is being stolen. This should not be permissible. We depend on your office to put a stop to these criminal and life-destroying practices. Without your defense, we will be helpless against our own destruction. It will kill our industry. It will ruin our lives. Help us.
