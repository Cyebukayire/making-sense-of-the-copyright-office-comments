<br/>AI, in the end, is not true intelligence artificial or otherwise, but merely a tool that depends on human-created works to function. Given the true nature of AI, we run across at least two big problems that need to be addressed:<br/><br/>First, AI&rsquo;s unauthorized use of human works. A system should be created where people can &lsquo;opt in&rsquo; to give permission for their works to be used by AI software.<br/><br/>Second, AI will process and reproduce bigoted language and content if such works are used by the AI. We already have enough problems with bigotry without using AI to produce them. Regulations of some type should be standardized to keep AI from reproducing the worst of humanity.<br/><br/>If any law regarding AI omits either of these two critical functions, our society will reap the true damage of what AI can do. Not a robotic takeover but an exacerbation of humanity&rsquo;s worst tendencies.<br/>
