Hello Copyright Office First, I&#39;m not a US citizen and I&#39;m not good at English so I have to use translator. I&#39;m not sure if I have the right to submit comments but I would like to raise a problem. First of all, the current AI regulations in your country are that works created using AI are not protected by copyright. But there are still problems with sales companies. paintings, they have to pay royalties to the artist butCurrently, they have chosen to cancel their contracts with artists and use AI-generated images instead. Even though the images are not protected by copyright, they don&#39;t care as long as they sell them. There are also large companies that use images from AI such as Pokemon. Go uses AI to make backgrounds. They make an unknown amount of profit from the game, but don&#39;t they have enough money to hire real artists? This clearly shows that the current rules are not enough. You guys should regulate commercial use (this is my opinion) And the last thing I want to talk about is AI tools. Adobe tries to say that they developed AI as a tool for artists, but instead it becomes a tool for thieves, even though they try to say that they used copyrighted images and did not copy them from other artists. But it&#39;s always been seen that artists find images similar to their own paintings on Adobe, making it clear that the company doesn&#39;t have any respect in this area. Instead, companies like Procreate<br/>A feature has been released to support animators in selecting tools (we never collect your data, and we never phone home. Because your work belongs to you)
