I am an author and a photographer. My work is my own and should remain that way. Generative AI &quot;learns&quot; by being fed the work of creatives, without compensation or permission. This is a violation of copyright. It is stealing. Our work is being used as a basis for creating content that will eventually eliminate the human element in the creative process entirely. This will affect the livelihoods of makers while those that have created GAI stand to make billions from it. Your office was created to protect intellectual property and to allow creative people to earn a living on their work. I am urging you to put an end to this practice. Not doing so will have a chilling effect on creative work going forward.
