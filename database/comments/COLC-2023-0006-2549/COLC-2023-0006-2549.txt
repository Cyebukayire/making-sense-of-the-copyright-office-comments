Hello, I am an illustrator, a graphic designer, an author and a fine artist. I am very concerned about the copyright violations I am seeing in the creative fields by generative AI. I have found my own work on sites that are allowing people to create &quot;art&quot; in the style of their chosen artist. I am seeing the graphic design field get decimated by things like Adobe Express which, no doubt, has been fed the work of millions of graphic designers so that Adobe can give it&#39;s users &quot;free&quot; design. I see things like Chat GPT being able to write in the style of authors and comedians. I illustrate children&#39;s books and all my art is copyright protected and yet I see it on these sites so that it can be mimicked. These copyrights are supposed to protect the creators work and our ability to earn a living. Generative AI is destroying the creative professions and it will quickly become impossible for anyone to make a living doing these jobs and thereafter there will be no cultural development. Please help us defend our work, our futures and our culture.
