Generative AI is destructive to all art, writing, acting creatives. Art is already being passed off as human created when it has truthfully been created by generative AI. The general public is clueless of this and this is what could lead to harm for both artist and fan. Unfortunately there are generative AI profiteers that will take advantage and lie, scrape, steal artists images, likenesses etc. There needs to be copyright protection for artist, actors and writers. Thank you!
