I am a Fine Arts college graduate who just started out in the industry, a few months ago. I got into this career by hard work, dedication, my own creativity, knowledge and hard earned skills. <br/><br/>I love seeing artists and non-artists alike learn, foster their creativity and skills, share experiences, do research, respect the craft, the history, the source materials and the like. With this supposed &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; introduced, the value and respect people show towards art and the craft itself has been degrading all the more and it is not about just art, other works and professions also applies, and its also about us being a better person and having a fulfilling life.<br/>This technology all does is devalue people&#39;s works and lives and isn&#39;t needed at all.<br/><br/>I share my artworks online so that I can reach many people, possibly them to do the same, to learn, to work hard, and to be genuine themselves, and also to be able step into the industry, meet many peers. learn, get experience and hopefully be able to earn a living with my passion. My ability to create art, my individuality, my own creativity isn&#39;t just a product, it&#39;s who I am, and to see such people treat my own art/ my experience, is not a good outlook for such &quot;technology&quot; and the same can be said for other fields outside of art who do not also need this so called &quot;technology&quot;<br/><br/> Jobs are also affected, the future of the art industry, the degradation of the multiple fields and many expertise,normal people, they are also AFFECTED. I am concerned about the young artists who would want to be able to work for their passions, and dreams, while having a fulfilling live, people who are in dire need of to sustain their families, people who want purpose, and yet what were having are just people who aren&#39;t even interested in the field nor adore the said expertise ruining people&#39;s futures.<br/><br/>The synthesised images and the likes of it are of no value, of no history and has nothing to contribute in any field. Creativity and human expression is one&#39;s own ability that everyone has and isn&#39;t in need of such &quot;Technology&quot;, the same can be said for knowledge, experience. &quot;AI&quot; making the work faster is not also a good thing as people need to work, in need of work, some of them want and love to work in order for their lives to have value. Copyright supposedly is enough in this field but however, I believe banning this &quot;technology&quot; or instead keep them closed or in research like before would not only prove more value and beneficial, but is also the right thing to do, ethical or not, human innovation and creativity wouldn&#39;t prosper.<br/><br/>What is the point in being an artist, when your creativity, thinking, decisions, references, and even your processes, and also possibly your job, your future is being thrown to the machines? Why bother improving yourself when you can choose to become someone who is dependent on such, a person who has no shame, self-worth and such.<br/><br/>If you are in a position who can do something about this and care about the history, the people, the future, I hope you can see that this technology wouldn&#39;t be of any help in a lot of field but would only be better if kept as research or gone. It&#39;s not just about work, it&#39;s also about respect in many aspects and of course being as an individual.
