Artificial Intelligence should not have access to material is otherwise owned.  It would be a plagiarism to permit artificial intelligence to co-opt and consume and digest and proliferate in any form, in any aspect material that is owned. The mere suggestion that copyrighted material be offered up to A.I. is offensive to the concept of intellectual property, art and ownership, and violates the right to intellectual property and the right to a copyright. Thank you much.
