A.I. needs to be regulated. The only way these programs are able to operate is by stealing and scraping images and words from HUMANS.  They devalue Human ingenuity, creativity and work. These programs do not create but destroy and put back together things it can only steal. As an artist and father of 4 Humans Beings, it is imperative that these programs be regulated and have laws enforced upon them to keep people like me to have the ability to show others the worth of our human endeavor and creativity through art. If A.I. programs have the ability to be copyrighted, then that is saying that theft is legal since it impossible for these machines to create from nothing. Only people, humans can do that. Please do the right thing and keep machines from stealing from me.
