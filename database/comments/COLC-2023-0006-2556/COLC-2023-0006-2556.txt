As a child attending Middle School I remember being taught by my teachers that the biggest offense that I could commit was to copy someone else&#39;s work. It was here that I learned what &quot;copyright&quot; meant, gaining an understanding that by copying someone&#39;s work that I was essentially robbing them of their voice and robbing myself of self exploration. It impacted me as I later would take on a profession in marketing, having to myself learn the skills of writing copy based on first learning about the company that took on my services. It required skill and understanding and it also required the ability to cope with changes in markets, expansion of the brand or business and the human touch that it takes to convey emotional intelligence. Later, I would transition into become a published author and screenplay writer. This furthered my understanding of the importance of originality and individuality. Now, in this new age of &quot;AI&quot; where programs are quite literally spitting out work based on material that has a copyright attached to it absolutely makes Middle-School me cringe. How is it that we have put in so many protections in place such as your Government establishment to protect artists from being robbed of what makes them a living only to now see that there are programs and software that have been created by people and are running right now free and clear from any repercussions? It simply baffles me that there is currently a &quot;Wild West&quot; on this frontier of Artificial Intelligence and in my estimation, gone unchecked and unregulated as it has, it will not only rob our artists of their professions, it will degrade art as a whole, reducing it down to the point of starvation and eventually, with nothing else to pull from that garbage it continues to re-iterate will start to sputter and our culture will be reduced to something incoherent.
