Any content (audio, video, visual media, etc.) generated by Artificial Intelligence cannot and should not have the ability to be copyrighted, because any such content is a composite of many different existing works, including works that may be copyrighted and used to train the AI model without permission. <br/><br/>Additionally, there is no clear answer when it comes to authorship of these generated works. The Artificial Intelligence model, as a program, cannot create works without human input. Who is the author? Is it who programmed the model? The individual authors whose works are being used to create this composite image? The model itself? Or the person who prompted the model? It just makes no sense to allow copyright of something that is auto-generated from the work of many others, and created not by a human being, but by a machine simply following an algorithm.
