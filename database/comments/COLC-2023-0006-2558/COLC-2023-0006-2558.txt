Hello,<br/>I&#39;m a writer and voice actor based in Los Angeles and I&#39;m writing to voice my concerns not only about the lack of ethics regarding the development of AI but the long term implications of where it could be going. LLM&#39;s like ChatGPT wouldn&#39;t exist without the data they are fed and unfortunately OpenAI has used materials that contain the works of countless writers and other creatives without any consent, payment, or consideration for their careers. They claim that this technology isn&#39;t supposed to replace creatives but augment and aid their output instead. This is a lie. The goal is automation of digital human input ranging from administrative work to people like me who spend their whole lives trying to express themselves through story. Essentially my words are being taken from me against my will to create an algorithm that would render me unnecessary. This is something that only benefits corporate entities where it ensures the only ones making any money on creative output are those at the top. No one would be able to make a living creating art or even engaging in cultural criticism again. The machines would do all the talking and the internet would be reduced to a sea of noise where no one will be able to tell what&#39;s authentic and real. Culture would be ultimately homogenized and those of us responsible for shaping it would be powerless to stop it. Nothing new would be created it ever again because nothing new would ever be heard again. This is even more evident for the development of image generators like Stable Diffusion and MidJourney, both that are guilty of scraping the internet for billions of images (copyrighted and private) to train their algorithms. Graphic artists and illustrators are actively being undermined as we speak where users can actually input their names into the programs to get artwork made in their styles which have taken a lifetime to fine tune. I fail to see how this falls under fair use seeing how mimicking a person&#39;s artistic choices isn&#39;t exactly transformative. Then there&#39;s the matter of voice cloning which may not fall under your purview, but I might as well bring it up. The technology is so advanced anyone can copy my voice and use it as they please treating it like toy that says anything the user wants no matter how despicable, and I am powerless to do anything about it. My voice is as unique as my fingerprint but copying only one of these would be identity theft. Perhaps legislation specific to this technology is necessary where maybe I could copyright my own voice rendering any copying a violation. This may not be feasible, but I figured I&#39;d mention it anyway. <br/>What good is copyright protection if we&#39;re all so vulnerable? And why are these companies acting with such reckless abandon? It&#39;s an ethical shortcut they&#39;re taking in the hopes of creating something so huge and ubiquitous it will be too late for them to suffer any real consequences for their theft. They want to be as indestructible as Facebook who haven&#39;t exactly faltered or been discouraged from their unethical behavior after the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. This is big tech in a nutshell. If they succeed, they reap the benefits and if they fail the American people get to live in the mess they created.
