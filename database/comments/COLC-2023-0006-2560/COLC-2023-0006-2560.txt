As a scholar, writer and filmmaker, I find it problematic that AI companies are taking things I made and using them without permission. Even if it is only for &quot;learning.&quot; I also think it is wrong that AI responses to questions do not automatically come with citations. Every AI response should include citations to credit sources of information. This should not be optional for users to see. It must be included automatically. These ideas are basic intellectual property concepts and also something that even elementary school students are required to do. It is research 101. Thank you.
