Hello, my name is Trish and I live in the Philippines. I am mostly affected by GenAI as it had taken my job as an artist. The people who are using these so-called &#39;tools&#39; are competing, and using our own artworks to train it on their AI. We, artists, have never allowed any of our creation to be trained on AI. We never authorize or grant them permission to use our artworks on AI. Famous artist like Greg Rutkowski, whose name has been used more than 93,000 times in the prompt, have never received any consent, credit and not compensated from those generated works. Big tech companies like Google, Meta, Twitter, etc. have also changed their ToS multiple times in which they want our content to be used on AI. <br/><br/>Please do not allow these companies. We don&#39;t want our content and data be used on any GenAI as it is a violation and against user&#39;s privacy. It has never been ethical in the first place. AI have already damaged the creative communities since last year when these AI Art Generators have been released and DeviantArt is one of them and the first art community to break their ToS to all artists in their platform. Now, it is coming to all of the jobs across the world rapidly. Without regulation, many people like me, who is from a 3rd world country, will suffer because we will likely lose our jobs as most of the jobs here are outsourced especially in the US. <br/><br/>The rise of Deepfake AI is also another threat and another dangerous application that it should be treated as a high level risk because no one deserve their face be used on AI especially if they have not done any criminal activities. These people who are using it should be held liable and be sentence to lifetime imprisonments.<br/><br/>People who are using and generating AI should be illegal and they should pay huge fines and be held liable. They&#39;ve also developed an AI watermarks removal so they can remove artists&#39; name in the art. Here in this link: https://twitter.com/art_magnifico/status/1625879414977224704. Opt-out is also a lie, please read this tweet from an ethical AI person: https://twitter.com/alexjc/status/1684295440269824006.<br/><br/>As what the USCO have said, copyright is meant to protect human works hence why they have already declined multiple submissions of purely AI art just to get it copyrighted. There&#39;s no human element because some of the people who keep using it cannot make any alterations VS artists who can make amendments of the work they&#39;ve created.<br/><br/>We want the USCO to protect artists against genAI models.<br/>We want the USCO to not let creators&#39; work be ingested by AI because the work should have been protected since the start of creation.<br/>We want the USCO to not grant copyright on any genAI.<br/>We want the government to not allow companies use our content and data for their genAI.<br/>We want the government regulate AI as soon as possible and to protect people against the dangers of AI.<br/>
