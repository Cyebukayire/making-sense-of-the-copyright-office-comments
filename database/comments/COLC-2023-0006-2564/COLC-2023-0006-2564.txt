I believe it&#39;s important to recognize that we all collectively trained AI with our data, all of us both living and dead. The work of generations passed has been used, as has the work of those like myself alive today. This should be recognized in some way, but not in a typical legal way of copyright enforcement. We can&#39;t possibly determine to what degree, in any accurate way, how certain individuals should be compensated compared to others for their specific contributions to AI models. But we can recognize that we all played a part.<br/><br/>I believe universal basic income is how to actually do that. It would recognize we all contributed to AI without preventing the good that AI can do for all of us, as we would if we claimed that copyright infringements were happening outside of Fair Use, and chose to prevent large models from being used in all the ways they could be used to increase overall productivity.<br/><br/>AI should work for all of us. UBI achieves that by being a universal dividend. The last thing we should do is prevent AI from working for any of us out of fears of income loss. We should instead make sure that we all benefit from AI use instead of restricting AI use.<br/><br/>When it comes to what we should do about AI and copyrights, universal basic inomce needs to be a part of the discussion as a necessary policy.
