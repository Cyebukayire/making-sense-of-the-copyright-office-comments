Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of the Copyright Office,<br/><br/>In my letter, I would like to address an argument that AI proponents use over and over again: &quot;AI learns like humans and does nothing different from an artist who gets inspired in a museum&quot;.<br/><br/>I think there is no question that a human being is shaped from an early age by their parents, their siblings, and their family and friends in kindergarten, school and university. People go through an emotional and individual process that influences their whole lives and becomes part of them. Every beloved love and every painful loss are pieces of a puzzle that strongly influence our individuality. A musician who writes a song about a loved one, an author who spends a vacation on the coast and is inspired by the landscape and the villages for a novel, or a mother who processes the painful loss of a child by painting pictures are in no way statistical data but parts of a life.<br/><br/>Whoever equates the statistical processing of previously analyzed pixels of billions of stolen human individual creative content with creativity or individuality has neither understood human nature nor AI itself. If there is an AI that has a real consciousness, an individuality, and, if you believe in it, a soul, then I am immediately willing to grant this machine a right of copyright. But then it would be the work of the machine itself and not of those who pull a lever like at a slot machine and wait for the result. AI does not go through any creative process but interpolates the statistical probabilities of pixels.<br/>AI is not inspired by anything and does not learn. It only processes statistics filled with billions of stolen human works. Those who request this output from the machine by pressing a button also do not go through a creative process themselves but are consumers and spectators of a highly complex calculation of values. This is equivalent to the gambler who pulls the lever of the slot machine and does this often until the result satisfies him.<br/><br/>I ask you to consider this and not forget what makes us human.<br/><br/>Respectfully<br/>Valentin Winkelmann<br/>
