AI should be held to the same standards as humans. If any piece of work is created that directly uses a work that has been copyrighted, then the person creating the new work should be required to abide by the rules of the copyright, even if it is used by to train an AI tool. And any work created by an AI should not be able to be copyrighted, unless it has been trained using only the work of one person, who would get to hold the copyright for the new work. Ownership is central to the concept of creation, as it is the only way we can recognize and reward those who create the works that impact society. Please do not let AI turn creativity into an algorithm, churning out derivative content and robbing so many of their livelihoods. There are so many better uses of AI than trying to replace human innovation and inspiration.
