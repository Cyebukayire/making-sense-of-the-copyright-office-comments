I am a writer and filmmaker. The intent of U.S. copyright is to promote progress and useful arts, Generative A.I. (GAI) will stifle both. GAI will lessen opportunities for actual human creativity and ingenuity by putting human artists and creators in direct competition with witless, unthoughtful pablum. The problem is that this pablum is superior in two ways: volume and cost. Though human creative work is preferable to GAI, the societal structures that support the flourishing of human creativity will be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of GAI content regardless of quality. This will have the net effect of destroying opportunities for humans to create art, develop new ideas, and thrive. Surely this is counter to the intent of the copyright clause.<br/><br/>The only ethical way to use GAI is if no one is able to own what it produces. If GAI creates a pleasing image, it is everyone&#39;s to use and transform. If GAI creates a new cancer drug, the formula must be the provenance of no single person or company and be made available freely.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that the rights afforded to citizens by the Constitution are meant only for human beings; not machines who perform parlor tricks, however impressive those tricks might be.
