The current hype (from claims of intelligence to human extinction fearmongering) surrounding &quot;AI&quot; all exists for one reason, without which none of this would be any news relative to existing ML technologies. That reason is the simple fact that you cannot simply search all or part of an AI-generated piece of media for a match with existing content. The sources for AI-generated media are obfuscated by the model blending ludicrous amounts of different inputs. <br/><br/>Since the same prompt in 2 copies of the program with the same seed produced the same result, there&#39;s nothing new added. It&#39;s all about getting away with plagiarism. The AI companies know the cost of the upcoming lawsuits could bankrupt them, and will lobby to make laws that target users of their malicious software instead. They will claim their computer program thinks like human beings, and try to get both exceptions for copyright infringement for scraping and copyright protections for their &quot;AI&quot; outputs. Do not give them any of these.
