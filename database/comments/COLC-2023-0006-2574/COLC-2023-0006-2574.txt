AI has no place in creating any form of art. It is formulas and analytics that have no place in writing, animation, pre/post or during production where any creative input is needed. I have known artists who have already had AI rip off their art, it is near impossible for anyone to have an original idea or message and that hope goes down to negatives with AI. While I do think AI can possibly be used to scan scripts and shows, and based on past data see what shows could be successful but AI will never understand the nuances of human emotions, thoughts, and desires. AI is not for creative spaces and never will be and I wish a majority of the population had the media literacy and forsight to see that as well.
