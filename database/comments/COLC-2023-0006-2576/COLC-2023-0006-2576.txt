I am a writer and director as well as a photographer. No one should be making money let alone using my work unless they have explicit permission to use it, and that includes using it to help generate work through AI programs. It is hard enough for artists and creatives to make money off of our work and our fears of our work being stolen, copied, and misused are already undervalued and ignored. This is one more step toward making our work, our minds, our hearts irrelevant and yet we are essential to the health of any society. Generative AI needs to be highly regulated and controlled so as not to destroy our creative efforts and our work. Thank you.
