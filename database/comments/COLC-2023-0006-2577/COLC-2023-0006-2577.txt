Concerned citizen here. I don&#39;t think materials generated by AI should be copyrightable unless it can be proven that the AI in question was trained only on things that are in the public domain/that are otherwise not copyrighted themselves. Additionally, an AI dataset should only be comprised of things that are explicitly permitted to be included in that dataset, and datasets should be public to prevent infringement in this way; if copyrighted materials are included in these datasets without permission, than the datasets themselves should be wiped.
