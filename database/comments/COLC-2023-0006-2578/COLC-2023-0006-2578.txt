Hello and thank you for your work on behalf of copyright holders everywhere.  I am an actor and filmmaker.  I am greatly disturbed by what appears to be the largest copyright violation in the history of your office.  The manner in which generative AI models are trained includes scraping the internet for any and all previously copyrighted material.  Furthermore, the companies behind this theft refuse to release the training methods, data or attributions.  Some of the most powerful companies in the world are treating copyright law as OPTIONAL.  This endangers all of the people who work in copyright making things and protecting things that are made by people.  And I&#39;m not clear what the benefit is, other than the reduction of payroll for the companies.  Please put the work of people ahead of profits for companies.
