As a creative professional working in the industry for over a decade, it pains me to see copyrighted artwork from my fellow creative colleagues used in the training datasets of major and minor Generative AI products. All of these copyrighted artworks are being scraped and used by these Generative AI products &amp; Companies under the guise of fair use to creative their &quot;FOR-PROFIT&quot; products. The quality of their product is a direct result of the use of copyrighted artwork from fellow creatives.<br/><br/>There needs to be strong regulations in place with strong &quot;OPT-IN&quot; ONLY, for any Generative AI product using copyrighted artwork. Any Generative AI Product &amp; Company should get permission, consent, and/or compensation for the use of any copyrighted artwork that they choose to use for their training datasets.<br/><br/>&quot;OPT-IN&quot; should be the default. &quot;Opt-Out&quot; does NOT work on many levels, and has been shown to only be a guise for some companies to appease media relation with the public.<br/><br/>Thank you!
