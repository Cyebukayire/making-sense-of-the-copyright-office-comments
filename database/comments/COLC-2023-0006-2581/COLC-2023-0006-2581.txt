This may be one of the most important issues we face as a society.  I am highly concerned about the future of creativity, intellectual property and ownership thereof.   AI uses data, information, art, writing, a persons image or voice and other human creations to generate whatever end task is asked of it.   Much of this would be considered plagiarism if another human did it.  I feel in many of its forms AI violates essential freedoms such the right to control and own one&rsquo;s  voice, image and ideas.  It is of the utmost importance that we use AI to benefit society while also closely safeguarding and protecting the rights and privileges of our citizens.  Please carefully consider the potential, both positive and negative when considering regulations and make the priority the people.  The to act is now.
