In my opinion, the only kind of product, art form, literature, etc. that can be copyrighted is the ones created by humans. And the mere fact of considering AI content worthy of entering into the copyright protection is in itself an insult to the artist, creators, thinkers and the human beings themselves. I&#39;m against any law or regulation that watches for AI over us humans. AI is a tool as well as other existing technologies, but we must separate what makes us human and unique. And what is generated based on copying previous human work, with no experiences or life, just collected data.
