AI art should be treated as something &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; rather than created (and therefore not be given copyright).  A prompter is really just curiously playing with word combinations, they can&rsquo;t solidly predict how that first handful of generations will look so that Da Vinci caliber image they end up with clearly isn&rsquo;t their brainchild.  &ldquo;Hybrid&rdquo; stuff where one uploads a sketch and the system builds off of really isn&rsquo;t hybrid in most cases either as the ads for these systems literally show grade school quality sketches getting turned into these professional images that have depth, color, lighting, shading, new objects, and small details which weren&rsquo;t present in the original.  Human art is all about PROCESS, there&rsquo;s a story behind the story such as how the artist got inspired or how they executed their vision w limited resources, the average prompter does not have a detailed starting image in their head, just a question at best (i.e. What would resident evil look like if it was a movie from the 80&rsquo;s ?).
