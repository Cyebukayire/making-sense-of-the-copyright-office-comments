Hello, and thank you for all your work on our behalf. I am an author and a filmmaker. I am greatly disturbed by what appears to be the greatest copyright violation in the history of your office. The manner in which generative AI (GAI) models are trained includes the ingestion of millions of copyrighted works scraped from the internet. Illustrations, paintings, photographs, books, comics, plays, scripts, short films, feature films, etc. This quite possibly includes the entirety of work that has been registered with your office. Copyrights protect the artist&#39;s effort and ability to make a living. It affords protections that justify the time it takes to create a work of art and protects an artist&#39;s style, such that the artists can make a living on that work. Your office is the reason so many culture-shaping works have come from the United States in<br/>the past 200 years. Generative Al models destroy those protections, and violate the very purpose of your office. GAl functions only if it is fed all of our copyrighted work. The GAl executives could train their models on their own personal journals and home movies, but they are instead training them on &quot;high-quality work,&quot; that is ours. This should not be permitted in any way. These GAI companies are making billions of dollars already with a tech that does not function without our work. There has been no consent asked and no compensation<br/>offered any of the artists whose work has been brazenly taken. Right now, any laymen can &quot;order up&quot; a film &quot;in the style of director Wes Anderson,&quot; or an illustration &quot;in the style of Karla Ortiz.&quot; This is copyright violating, career-destroying, and soul- crushing for the artists, themselves. It should be stopped. We depend on the copyright office putting an end to this arrogant and illegal practice. Without your defense there will most probably be<br/>little artistic development coming from the US in the future.
