Thank you for taking the time to solicit comments on this important issue. As a writer and a filmmaker, the ability to copy someone else&#39;s creative work and use it to generate new versions of it is scary and upsetting. As artists, the most important aspect of our work is that we own it. If anyone can take it, replicate it, or use it create new art without compensating us, then the whole creative system as employment will fail. Please pass strong regulations on this new technology so artists can continue to be compensated for their work. Thank you.
