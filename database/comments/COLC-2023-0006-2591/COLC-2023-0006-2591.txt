I am TV-Film writer and producer, and I, like many people across various industries, am concerned with AI being used to replace me as a worker and, as a result, eliminate the way that I make money. As a general matter, the idea that efficiency and profit over relying upon the labor of individuals will lead us down a disastrous path where we eliminate jobs so that wealth can accumulate among a few tech moguls and investors. It&#39;s no way to establish and maintain and healthy economy where all can participate. In particular, as it relates to AI being used to replace work done by artists -- writers, actors, singers, painters, etc. it requires us to inspect what&#39;s really important to us as a society. Does the cheaply-made, soulless end product justify the cost-efficient, quickly made means? Is a movie valuable just because it exists or because it was made by artisans who informed the making of that movie with their heart, soul, and lived experience? A few tech moguls have greed and wealth hoarding and nothing else as their north star, which is why we -- policymakers, workers, consumers, voters, and stakeholders -- must work together to put meaningful regulations in place that govern the way that AI can be used. These regulations should be made with the kind of economy, labor force, culture, and society we ultimately want to have in mind.
