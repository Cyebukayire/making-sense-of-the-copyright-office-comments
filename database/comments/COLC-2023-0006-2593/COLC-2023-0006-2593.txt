As a writer, artist, and actor, I am extremely worried about the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence to copy and reproduce artistic material. Its unfettered use stands in direct opposition to the rights listed in the Berne Convention of 1886. Most notably, the right to translate, to make adaptations, to perform in public, to broadcast, to use as a basis for audiovisual work, and&mdash;most of all&mdash;to make reproductions in any manner or form. This Convention was formed to protect artists worldwide, with the belief that creators should have the means to control how their works are used, by whom, and on what terms. At this point in time, these rights are only protected from other humans&mdash;not AI. I am calling on the Copyright Office and all involved parties to update the Berne Convention once again. We need an updated clause that protects these same rights from Artificial Intelligence and similar computer programs. Our demands as artists have not changed, but the manner of reproduction and adaptation quite obviously has. Our laws should adapt accordingly. Creatives like myself spend a lifetime perfecting our skills and talents in order to translate our very real lives, traumas, and human experiences into meaningful creative works. Ones that connect humans on an emotional and spiritual level. Ones that create and maintain culture. Ones that provide meaning and beauty to an otherwise hard and confusing existence. That is far, far too valuable to be used up, repurposed, and&mdash;frankly&mdash;botched by a non-human entity. In the spirit of Victor Hugo, may we reconvene the Berne Convention and protect these precious human works from unsolicited adaptations&mdash;whether human or AI.
