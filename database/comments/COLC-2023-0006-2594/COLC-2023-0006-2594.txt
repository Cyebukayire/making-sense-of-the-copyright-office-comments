Thank you for taking on the review of this subject. As you know, the use of AI in the generation of art, writing, and other fields yet unknown represents a potential paradigm shift in how new works are generated, and carries with it the risk of significant job loss across all creative fields if left unregulated.<br/><br/>On the use of copyrighted works to train AI models: AIs are not young artists and writers naively tracing patterns and imitating styles until they find their own voices; they&#39;re computer programs, written by people who have deliberately stolen copyrighted images and writing in the hopes of making a profit off the works of others via generating similar products. As such, data sets should only be allowed to use material explicitly in the public domain--not just &quot;freely&quot; available sources; images and writing shared on the internet in good faith by artists and writers wishing to reach other humans are not &quot;free&quot; to be profited from by data set creators--with the only exception being copyrighted works purchased for data sets from the copyright holder with full disclosure as to their intended use with AI (and with no tolerance for forced inclusion, such as Deviant Art&#39;s automatic opting in of all artists, or Twitter&#39;s new terms of service allowing for all tweets to be used in AI training no matter their creators&#39; wishes. Existing on the internet should not equate to selling one&#39;s words and art to a corporation forever.)<br/><br/>On the appropriate levels of transparency and disclosure with respect to the use of copyrighted works: Complete disclosure is the only route that&#39;s not deliberately lying to or outright stealing from creators. Data sets by their nature already catalogue every inclusion; a data set creators should be able to produce the list of all art/writing that they trained their model on, with sufficient proof as to the legitimacy (eg: copyright holder&#39;s express permission) of the works included. If this means dumping their existing data sets and retraining their models again, that is a burden they forced upon themselves by trying to steal others&#39; work to begin with.<br/><br/>On the legal status of AI-generated outputs: AIs are not humans, nor are their products the work of human minds; their actual code, created by humans, can be copyright to their creators, but their produced works should not be anymore copyrightable than the results of any other algorithmic equation. The court case about the photograph taken by a monkey being uncopyrightable is a highly appropriate precedent to follow. The way leaves fall on a sidewalk in autumn is beautiful, too, but equally mindless, and equally in need of a human&#39;s artistic efforts being deliberately applied before it can be copyrighted as art. AI generated art/writing should not be copyrightable in its default state: it should require significant human shaping post-generation to be copyrightable, though again only if the model involved was based entirely on non-copyrighted or appropriately compensated works. Otherwise any output/creations would be rooted in plagiarism.<br/><br/>Thank you again for your time in reading this. As a novelist and a computer science teacher, this is a topic of incredible importance to the future of myself, my students, and the future. A world where AI makes art and humans labor is not the world we should build. Please protect the rights and livelihoods of human artists and writers over the interests of algorithms and their creators.
