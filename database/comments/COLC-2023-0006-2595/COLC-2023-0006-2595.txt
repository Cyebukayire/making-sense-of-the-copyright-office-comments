I oppose allowing generative AI to train on copyrighted works, as I consider it a form of plagiarism. I also oppose allowing fully AI-generated writing or art to be copyrighted, for the same reasons, and also because no creative or intellectual process took place to generate the product. In addition, I think individuals&rsquo; appearances and voices should be considered their own intellectual property.
