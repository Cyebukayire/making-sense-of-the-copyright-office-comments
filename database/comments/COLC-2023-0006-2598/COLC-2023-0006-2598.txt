Hello, as both a professional artist and professional actress, the threats to my work from AI are disturbing. I am extremely concerned by the unregulated theft of artists work for the training of ai systems just to then regurgitate a part of individuals work and sell it as new. Companies should not be able to profit through this theft. In regards to AI in the film and television world, the threat to having my very moving image, almost essence stolen and manipulated without consent feels like a violation of my rights as a human being. Please heavily regulate the uses of AI. Do not assume that these companies will work for the good of anyone other than their own profits. Do not abandon us to the &ldquo;disrupters&rdquo;. AI in the arts is not essential but our rights as citizens are. Thank you for seriously evaluating this threat.
