I&#39;ve heard some people claim that AI threatens human creativity. That is untrue. AI does not threaten human creativity because that would imply that human creativity can be trumped by a series of algorithms. AI&#39;s creative process is parasitic in nature. Nothing it can create stands alone, for its very program scalps the work of human creators who have created their art in an effort to express themselves. By placing a check on AI, we would be able to preserve the integrity of art, the integrity of artists, and the identity of artists who are making art in an effort to be human.
