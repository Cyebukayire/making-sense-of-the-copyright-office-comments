copyright <br/><br/>Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment. I am an author/artist whose living depends on my being able to monetize my work. I&rsquo;m also a supporter of other fellow authors and artists who also depend on monetizing their work for a living. And further, I&rsquo;m a supporter of fellow artists and authors that create art and writing for the purpose of self fulfillment and mental exercise. <br/><br/>There is a constitutional basis for restricting use of artists&rsquo; and authors&rsquo; works for training AI. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;&nbsp; Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution.<br/><br/>Additionally, copyright regulates transformational and derivative works. Any work created by a human using an AI tool is therefore a derivative of the work that it was trained on, regardless of how much of an imitation is present. The AI-created work is a derivative and/or transformative work regardless. <br/><br/>While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.&nbsp; To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering the comments of the public, and in particular, the concerns and worries of those of us whose livelihoods depend on our ability to monetize our works and those of us whose livelihoods depends on copyright protecting our works.
