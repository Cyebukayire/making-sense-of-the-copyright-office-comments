Regarding the first question of how these generative AI systems affect creators, they risk making the barrier to entry for amateur artists an even more difficult hurdle to overcome. Artists tend to be introverted beings that constantly suffer imposter syndrome and amateur artists in particular already have low self-esteem about how good their work actually is and have difficulty charging people what their art is worth because art is not seen as a valid profession in our society and culture unless you&#39;re already a successful artist. With generative AI, it removes an entire low-cost art market that aspiring artists rely on when starting out because those types of people often don&#39;t care how the art gets made or what creative decisions were taken, they just want the final product done and done now. It can also lead amateur artists just starting out to become discouraged. &quot;This computer program can do x, y, z better and faster than me and people are paying for it, so why should I bother? Nobody will ever notice my art or care&quot; and that is the true death of an artist. Artists will always exist regardless of what happens with AI, but without legal protections in place, it&#39;ll be much more difficult for artists to make a living with their art, and AI cannot make true art that is born of a creative reinterpretation of one&#39;s own life experiences. Generative AI can only create the illusion of art from those who&#39;ve already put in the hundreds and thousands of hours of craft and life to create the real thing. Artists create the things they want to see that don&#39;t already exist in the world whereas AI can only create from what already exists.
