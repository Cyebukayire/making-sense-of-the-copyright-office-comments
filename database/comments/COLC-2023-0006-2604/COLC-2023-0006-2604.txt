Should AI have rights to &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; papers that have been created? My stance on this question is no. According to How does AI actually work? (mozilla.org).  AI by definition is &ldquo;software that can learn patterns from information.&rdquo; I do not think that AI should be able to copyright what they have written since none of the content that has been put together is original thoughts. AI uses a wide spread of databases and content, then they chop up work that people have come up with and make it &ldquo;their own&rdquo;. I do not believe it is ethical or moral to allow content created by AI to be copyrighted because of the time and work that people put into making sure their work isn&#39;t plagiarizing someone else&#39;s, while AI just cuts and re-writes their work in a third of the time. I think that AI should be considered plagarizing if it is used in a way for someone else to be taking credit for the chopped up work of others. I also believe that if AI is going to be used across databases that those said databases should have to send out some sort of notification to the users and publishers that are posting their content there so that they are able to minimize AI or others plagiarizing their work without them knowing, at least this way they are forced to acknowledge that it is possible that someone or something is going to cut up and re write their work. <br/>
