AI art has been detrimental to the relationship between consumer and artist because it makes it seem like artists&#39; skills are no longer needed, even though AI must steal art from artists both copyrighted and not just to make anything of its own, with no ability for true creativity. AI art can be a useful tool, but until there are regulations on which the programs are trained on and why they&#39;re used, it isn&#39;t safe or fair to let it run freely and be used without any sort of regulations. Artists deserve to be compensated for their work, and an AI art programmed off of a specific artist makes certain kinds of consumers think that they can now get commissions &quot;from&quot; that artist (in an approximation of their style) without having to pay for it at all. It&#39;s unbearably unfair to the work the artist did to hone their craft, and the ways AI art could have been used as a tool have been overshadowed and swept under its &quot;use&quot; as a way to cut the artist out of the picture entirely, when someone wants a piece of art.
