Thank you for taking the time to read this. We are at a time where AI is a threat to so many industries and to general human creativity and to the rights of artists. Artists have a right to their art without it being put into generative ai models without their knowledge or their consent. Not protecting artists rights will be incredibly detrimental for the future of art in all industries. Please protect artists and their art so that the future of all arts doesn&#39;t just become AI because that&#39;s the most affordable way to do art but an incredibly unethical way to do art. Allowing GAIs to continue scraping art with out consent is extremely unethical and blatantly goes against our copy right laws. Please protect artists, art and the future of art industries.
