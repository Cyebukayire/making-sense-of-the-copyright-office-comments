Thank you for giving people the chance to comment on this important issue.<br/><br/>I&#39;m a writer whose living will depend on whether or not I can make enough money off my work to support myself. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo; Letting AI train on copyrighted works without consent and fair compensation violates an author&#39;s exclusive right to control their work while copyright applies.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it is already difficult for writers to make a living off of their writing. The nonprofit Author&#39;s Guild (https://authorsguild.org/news/authors-guild-survey-shows-drastic-42-percent-decline-in-authors-earnings-in-last-decade/) surveyed 5,000 authors in 2018 and found that &quot;writing-related earnings by American authors... finds incomes falling to historic lows to a median of $6,080 in 2017, down 42 percent from 2009... respondents who identified themselves as full-time book authors still only earned a median income of $20,300, well below the federal poverty line for a family of three or more... books of quality often demand time and research that can&rsquo;t be sustained if an author also needs to teach and lecture to make ends meet... This raises serious concerns about the future of American literature&mdash;books that not only teach, inspire and elicit empathy in readers, but help define who Americans are and how the U.S. is perceived by the world.&quot;<br/><br/>If authors (and all artists) are not fairly compensated for their work being used to train generative AI, it will make it even more difficult for them to make a living off of their art and keep producing their art. Artists and writers should give consent and receive compensation to be included in a training set, and images and writing resulting from AI should not be eligible for copyright without significant further human manipulation/improvement of the generated image or writing.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>Thank you again for your time and consideration.
