All AI applications require oversight and regulation. People program AI - people are biased, AI becomes biased. These biases spread through misappropriated and misapplied analytics and personal data, snowballing through media and online platforms. AI is not responsible for ALL the horrible lies and propaganda skewing public perception these days, but it&#39;s NOT helping.<br/>Safety issues (programmed decision-making), copyright infringement/plagiarism (scraping the internet for shared criteria then spitting out hybrids as unique), generative AI spreading misinformation as fact, esp. online (garbage in, garbage out), and surveillance overreach are just a few of the obvious pitfalls in this ethical morass.<br/>As for copyright in particular, using AI to cobble together a work of any kind by dismantling existing properties owned by real life people is, in my opinion, quite like taking a pair of scissors and cutting up a newspaper, gluing words back together in a different order, and then showing everyone the article I published.<br/>
