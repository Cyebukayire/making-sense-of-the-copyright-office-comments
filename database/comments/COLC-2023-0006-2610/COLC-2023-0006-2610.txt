1: AI  presents a threat to creators. It allows impersonation of people&#39;s art / creations / their voice. It also devalues the work of creators and endangers small creators livelihoods.<br/><br/>5: Yes new legislation is warranted. Using copyrighted material as training data for AI models should require permission from the copyright holder. Companies / entities who want to make AI generated content based on the work / likeness of people, should be required to get permission to do so from the original creator. <br/><br/>8: Using copyrighted work for training AI models should not constitute fair use, as AI models in their current state are not transformative. They can not add anything new that wasn&#39;t included in the training dataset, and thus do not meaningfully transform the content in a way that fair use would apply to.<br/><br/>9: Copyright holders should have both. They should need to give affirmative consent for their work to be used in training materials, as well as they should be be provided with means to opt out. If the usage of the copyright holder&#39;s work is done without the copyright holders permission then opting out should also require the AI model generated using it be deleted.
