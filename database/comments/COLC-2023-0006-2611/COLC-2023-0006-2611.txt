It seems so laughably obvious that a computer cannot claim a copyright anymore than a car can claim citizenship or a toaster can claim libel.<br/><br/>Machines are not humans, thus machines cannot claim the rights of humans.<br/><br/>Additionally, the efforts by huge corporations to use machine to &quot;generate&quot; (regurgitate with slight modifications created by program filters) text and images and video is clearly an attempt to strip away the rights and livelihood of writers and actors and artists who actually DO create original works.<br/><br/>It is conceivable that the Copyright Office would make such a ridiculous decision as to grant copyright to machines and programs. I BEG you to step away from this nonsense with all possible speed.
