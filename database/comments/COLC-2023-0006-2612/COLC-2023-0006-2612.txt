As a writer, the use of AI is terrifying. It pulls from wherever it pleases with no attribution and no reckoning for the truth. AI is being turned to as a &ldquo;content&rdquo; tool - which I am more than discontent with. We spent years crafting words, unearthing trauma, and AI spits it up from a baseless search. While I am not a visual artist, I have witnessed countless creators whose distinct visual style was ripped off in a matter of seconds. There are supposed to be permissions granted and royalties paid, and AI provides neither. Creatives are getting ripped off, to put it plainly. Our art makes us find beauty in life and allows other voices to speak up, and AI disintegrates those possibilities. Enough is enough. AI directly violates copyrights.
