I&rsquo;m Braden Duncan (a.k.a. Clockwork Art), a full time artist who earns 100% of my income from my art. I&rsquo;ve been dealing with art theft for years, first with unscrupulous print-on-demand sites, then with the NFT debacle, and now with AI companies who think they deserve unlimited access &amp; use rights to any &amp; every image on the internet. <br/><br/>My work has been shared so many times across so many virtual platforms that it would be literally impossible to find &amp; either remove or update every image with an aggressive watermark. Any art uploaded to the internet is apparently fair game for the AI theft bots, as I discovered when a basic keyword search returned over 100 of my pieces in the LAION image training database in under an hour. <br/><br/>I&rsquo;m tired of spending countless hours scouring AI datasets for my work &amp; reporting stolen imagery reprinted on unauthorised merchandise. I&rsquo;m tired of sending thousands of DMCA takedown notices when the companies stealing &amp; profiting my work should bear 100% of that legal &amp; financial burden.<br/><br/>AI platforms indiscriminately scrape thousands of websites in order to obtain existing art &amp; photos to train their image generators. Instead of using images already in the public domain or uploaded with artist consent, their business model (including subscription fees &amp; costs per image) depends on images created by contemporary living artists used without permission or proper licensing. These companies *know* this is unethical (see their TOS regarding music sampling), but technology is evolving more quickly than visual art industry protections have been able to regulate.<br/><br/>Every visual artist who shares their work online is threatened by AI exploitation. Congress needs to act NOW to set a precedent of holding art thieves &amp; the sites that host &amp; profit from them both legally &amp; financially accountable. We desperately need laws that clearly state &#39;publicly available&#39; images means publicly available for *viewing* - NOT for reprinting or re-purposing for profit without consent, credit, or compensation.<br/><br/>AI imagery isn&#39;t expression &amp; it certainly isn&#39;t art. There&#39;s no perspective, no experience, no imagination or inspiration; it&#39;s just a derivative, recombinant collage of exploitation intentionally designed to profit from the passion &amp; efforts &amp; experience of actual creatives.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>~ Braden Duncan
