I have been following the discussion around AI due to both its impact on my work as an academic teaching courses and its impact on my friend&#39;s work as artists, writers, and creatives, and as a programmer, I believe that AI should not be permitted to train on copyrighted work, and AI produced work should not be able to be copyrighted. AI is a glorified copyist, and owners of copyrighted work have the right to determine how they want their work to be used; AI using their work without permission violates that right in order to produce work that copies theirs without giving credit or obtaining permission. AI work is purely derivative, with no real thought or creativity behind it; prompts use to generate AI work are equivalent to a request submitted to an artist, and are not sufficient creative input to warrant credit to the user - nor are AI generators, purely algorithmic with no true creativity, capable of producing truly novel work that can be copyrighted as such. Furthermore, while AI has the potential to be useful for coding, grammar checking, and the like, its wide inclusion threatens the work of others by promising to both steal what has been done before for training sets and take the place of novel authors by offering a cheap, low-quality replacement, while providing no compensation to those creatives who produced the original work, as copyright is intended to protect against. Refusing copyright to AI provides an incentive to continue supporting actual creatives, protection for those creatives and their work, and promotes the progress of science and useful arts as is the intention of copyright law. <br/>Thank you very much for your consideration of this issue and for considering these comments.
