Hello, I am a freelance illustrator and painter for several years and I want to give feedback on the general questions as the results moving forward will have a profound impact on me and my family&#39;s future. My perspective will reflect that of an artist and also a consumer of goods and media on the internet.  <br/><br/>1  - Logically, the access to generative AI would increase the ability for production of each individual to be potentially endless. However, generative AI is not something that will be accessible to everyone. Very quickly, the companies who control the largest amounts of data will become the most powerful players in the industry. Data that importantly is not freely or willfully given to said companies. If the goal of generative AI is to improve human output or however someone wants to phrase it, it should be used to the benefit for all humans, not a profit driven output machine. Using this technology has already been shown to help improve research and medical practice but it&#39;s not without the faults of the bias of the dataset, input, and the interpreter of the output. &quot;Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself.&quot; Why would or should copyright protections be granted to material that the human involved had nothing to do with but the idea itself.<br/><br/>2 - Yes, As an established freelancer it has been ... ok so far. I have been relying the the fact that companies can not reliably use AI generated artwork with no future concerns of ownership and copyright.  Younger artists and beginners have been absolutely ruined and are struggling to find work from clients. Even if those clients are actively looking to NOT purchase AI generated works, Many scammers use AI to create &#39;artwork&#39; for unlivable wages or just fake portfolios enough to fool clients to steal their money . Instead of impersonating real artists they can now rely on AI to drain the industry from the bottom up. As AI gets more advance , the average person has no resources or lack the training to point out AI from artist made works. <br/><br/>3 - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922 On the Danger of Stochastic Parrots by Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Margaret Mitchell <br/><br/>I would caution listening too heavily to the CEOs and employees of AI companies , in interviews with them they seem starry-eyed for the progress and profits. <br/><br/>4 - I don&#39;t know if there is one but I hope there will be. The Internet and the world is forever connected.  We&#39;re going to be heading in a BAD place if there isn&#39;t an international agreement. Especially if people can&#39;t tell what&#39;s real anymore due to lies / misinformation/ &#39;hallucinations&#39; from AI tech people rely on. <br/><br/>5 - I feel like The fair use doctrine already handles it? &quot;the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&quot; especially so .  There&#39;s also valid concerns of Data sets not being public for review  for people to CHECK if there is copyrighted work involved in the making . Which seems to put all the effort on the infringed to find their works rather than it being an opt-in / compensated / public domain data set from scratch . <br/><br/>8.3 - For research ,in the pursuit for the betterment of humanity, I believe should be allowed . That&#39;s not what happened. MidJourney, Stability AI, and OpenAI labeling themselves as research labs to pretend they are performed academic research. Once each project turns into a company that seeks to gain profit, That data is no longer fairly gained nor theirs to use . It&#39;s honestly ridiculous that they are trying to say it&#39;s ok because of that one weird loophole.<br/><br/>9 - Opt in only! Artists and illustrators make their livelihood licensing and reusing their artworks,  To force the creators, to manually opt out of every system is an undue burden for every individual that isn&#39;t backed by a huge company. Not to mention that many images on the internet are shared and reshared by NOT the original copyright owner. How would that possibly work if the artist was careful enough to never share their work without jumping thru all the hoops but aunt sally shared their artwork on facebook or something. It would change how the internet works entirely . <br/><br/>I am exhausted even answering these questions. It&#39;s a great tool but it should not be one allowed to be locked away for profit and destroy artists professions because of data scraping. The AI companies that are all springing up are liable for their actions and should be held accordingly for the issues they cause. Because who does it really serve if we allow copyright protections to generative media that has no desires, no creativity, no truths to share, but just a parrot in a form of a pretty picture.
