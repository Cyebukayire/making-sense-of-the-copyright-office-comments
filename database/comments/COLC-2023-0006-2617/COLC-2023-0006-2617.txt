Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment. I am an avid reader and strongly support writers and artists and believe that AI pose a threat to their ability to create unique art and get properly paid for that work.<br/><br/>The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.&nbsp; This balances the author&#39;s right to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s right to the work.&nbsp; Applying this system to generative AI is fair. It would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their copyroghted works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work without their explicit consent.
