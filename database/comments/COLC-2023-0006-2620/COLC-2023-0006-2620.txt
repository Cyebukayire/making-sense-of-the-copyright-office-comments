I am a screenwriter, writer, illustrator and game designer. In the past two short years I have watched A.I. go from what seemed like a party trick to inserting itself into actual industries and exploding into a $100 billion industry. While I can see many positive applications for A.I, the world of creative art is not one of them. Human artists need to be protected against non-consensual training of their art into A.I. models, and A.I. art should never, ever be copyrighted. Why? Because it is not made by a single human, or even a single endeavor, but the mass amalgamation of countless artists the A.I. model has been trained on. As we have already seen, there is no way to police ethical training of A.I. models. If A.I. could be strictly regulated as to what human art was used to train it, then perhaps there could be compensation models for human artists, or the potential to copyright an A.I. trained from a single human artist, with their permission. However this is NOT the case right now, or the foreseeable future. Allowing A.I. art to be copyrighted would be disastrous for human art on a global scale. Human visual arts would wither away, since what is currently a struggling industry would just evaporate away. Human art is the best thing about being human. It&#39;s truly what makes our human presence on Earth special, and we should do everything in our power to protect that at all costs. I cannot stress enough, do not allow A.I. works to become copyrighted. Do not let them invade the commercial space and wipe out human art and artists. Do not let the lifetime of work by human artists become fodder for these A.I. models, ruining careers literally overnight. There is no reason we need human art cheaper, or faster. Art is not meant to be cheap or fast. It is meant for humans, by humans, at a speed humans can create, and at a price that holds value for both the artist and the buyer. Thank you for your time.
