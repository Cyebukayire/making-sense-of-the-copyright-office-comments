I believe that humans should be the only ones with the right to copyright  artwork made by their own hands. AI is not a human and cannot  own things itself. There is no need for AI to be able to copyright, except so that humans that want to use AI want to find some loophole to own art creates by AI. This guy is essentially trying to own something he did not create.
