Hi, im an illustrator and designer. I make a living off of the sweat of my own creativity. Ive struggled for years vs. brutal uphill market forces to make a living the way i do. But i finally got there. Now all the effort of myself and others are simply being taken without credit, compensation or more importantly permission to feul the greed of our tech overlords.  We as creatives foot the bill of years of research and development, that we refine into our own ip and copyrighted material , only for it to be hoovered up, blended up, and the sources obscured by the AI algorythms.  Competing in the same market place with ai trash derived from our own efforts. They mine us for content they then make it impossible for us to operate in the market. We foot the bill of development and they just swoop in and take the fruits of our labour for themselves.  Further, its clear the Gov cannot be trusted as regulatory capture is happening in front of our very eyes. Just look at the farce of a discussion held behind closed doors with Senator Schumer.  The vast majority of the people whom are getting to voice and opinion in this pay to play system are the foxes being asked to look after the hen house. (tech CEO&#39;s) No ML experts, or artists to provide and alternative or counter narrative, while the world is being bamboozled by &quot;existential threat&quot; nonsense arguments.  Sen Schumer must sure have made a killing in donations that day. OpenAI is now desperately trying to hide what they have trained on in an attempt to avoid the obvious legal issues it will face. Everyday they update and patch ChatGPT with no warning, with no changelogs, with this in mind. We are having our futures stolen and the copyright office is standing in the way of a way off money and influence. I can only hope that it does the right thing.
