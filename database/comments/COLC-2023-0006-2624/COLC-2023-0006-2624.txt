H!  I am writing to you today in regards to your inquiry about Artificial Intelligence and Copyright.  Why?  Because I am one of the many people this rapidly advancing technology has had a giant impact on.  For the past 10+ years I have worked as a concept artist and illustrator in games and animation.  I&#39;ve worked on everything from World of Warcraft to epic (and still under NDA) movies for one of our greatest living directors.  This is not an attempt to brag, but rather an attempt to show that I am a working professional in the creative field.  However, I have not had work in nearly half a year because jobs in my field have all but disappeared with the advent of AI technology.  Over the past year I have learned much about this technology and so I&#39;ll try to briefly cover why it should never be allowed to hold copyright.<br/><br/>I&#39;m just going to point out the biggest elephant in the room immediately- AI is not nearly as intelligent as the people pushing it claim.  What people are currently labeling as &#39;AI&#39; are just LLMs (large language models), a system of storing, sorting and retrieving data that is set up like an artificial neural net to access vast amounts of information.  It is NOT creative or capable of free thought and is bound by the data is was trained on (that data comes first and foremost from the LAION 5b data set which contains data from millions of people scraped from the internet without their permission.  My work is found in the data set and I never gave permission for it to be used).  The images or phrases it outputs may at time appear &#39;new&#39;, but every word, every pixel was put in place because it matched up in key words (&#39;prompts&#39;) with an existing piece in the data set.  Remove that training data, and the AI will generate nothing.<br/><br/>&#39;How does that differ from people taking inspiration from others for their work?&#39;  The differences are immense.  No human brain could ever hold the amount of training data an LLM can.  Our brains have a finite amount of space, and so we pick and choose what memories to keep and what to let fade.  And for every person in existence, the memories we keep will differ.  That&#39;s what colors our individual creativity- the lives we&#39;ve lived and who we choose to be.  So while an artist may do a study of a Rembrandt, they aren&#39;t breaking every point of color down into a data point to regurgitate later like an LLM would, they&#39;re learning how to move a brush or how to use color to draw the eye.  They will learn from the practice and use it to evolve their own work.  And someday they may even take that skill they learned and evolve an entirely new art style.  AI could never do that.  You could take any major image generator back to the early Renaissance and feed it every image in existence at that point, and it will never develop a style like Impressionism or Pop Art.  If image generators replaced Da Vinci, they would never create that coy smile on Mona Lisa&#39;s lips.  This is why across the various image generators if you use the same seed and prompts, they will output essentially the same image- all they know how to do is look up values and arrange them in a way they&#39;ve been told works.<br/><br/>Some will argue that AI is simply a tool.  &#39;No different than a smart phone to a photographer&#39; they say.  It is not &#39;a tool&#39;.  A tool makes a task easier, it doesn&#39;t replace the task entirely.  Part of the great joy of art is the process of creating and evolving, no matter the medium (aka &#39;tool&#39;).  A true creative can make art with anything.  Take away every paintbrush, every Photoshop app, every pencil, and hand an artist a stick and a pile of sand and they will STILL find a way to create something memorable.  If we took away an image generator could any &#39;prompt artist&#39; do the same?  Most can&#39;t even fix the obvious errors in the outputs.  Likewise it points out another false argument for AI- it is not making creativity more accessible.  LLMs typically charge a fee and use up a tremendous amount of resources and energy.  I learned how to draw with free crayons and grocery bags.<br/><br/>Allow AI to hold copyright and the majority of creative jobs will disappear overnight. It&#39;s already a rough existence, one where our pay rates haven&#39;t gone up in 100 years despite movies and games posting record profits.  Human creative ingenuity, that spark that people have held since we first drew chubby horses on cave walls, will be crushed into obscurity.  The majority of creatives will be forced into menial work, while the corporations who took our creations (&#39;data&#39;) and fed their LLMs with it will continue to reap profits from our hard work with zero compensation to us. Art will stagnate. The only people left who could feasibly still create art will be the rich, concentrating power and influence into an even smaller number of people than it currently is and widening the class divide. Even top economists like Daron Acemoglu believe this is the future we are heading towards with AI.  Please don&#39;t let that be our future.
