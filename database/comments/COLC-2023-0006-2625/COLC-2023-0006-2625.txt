I truly appreciate the U.S. Copyright Office opening up the discussion concerning AI to the public.  I believe this issue is something very fast-growing, and letting artists and those who purchase art give their thoughts will help resolve this problem in a professional fashion.  <br/><br/>I am personally not an artist by trade, but I am a hobby artist.  My work is not famous by any means, but it is decent.  I know if I&#39;m ever in a financial pinch, I have the ability to sell some art.  This is a form of financial security for me.  For other artists, it is their entire livelihood.  Those artists, however, are usually quite famous.  They have distinct, recognizable art styles, and they generally have a large following of fans on social media or in art-focused social groups.  Some work for companies, designing and animating for large productions, while others work freelance and accept commissions from the general public.<br/><br/>Either way, it is their chief (and often only) source of income.  I truly believe that all artists are being threatened by AI art.  Many programs allow for pieces of art to be fed into an collection of example pieces for AI to &quot;learn&quot; from.  Most times, the artists who created the art originally are not consenting parties to the usage of their work in that manner.<br/><br/>And art is work.  Hours upon hours of work for every single piece, and years upon years of training to get an artist to their professional skill level.  Meanwhile, AI art can be rendered in no time at all, simply because it is a program that has learned to steal humans&#39; work.  They are stealing the work so blatantly, that often AI art will copy down traces of watermarks and signatures onto its final products.  It feels a bit like a mockery, really.<br/><br/>Moreover, this is not only affecting illustrative work either.  I have seen over the past few months many professional musicians and voice actors being targeted by AI learning using their voices to say words that the professional in question had never said, or sing music that they would never sing.  Not only is this a blatant disregard for the work it takes to become a musician or actor, but it is also concerning in the aspect of possible confusion in future castings.  Why would a company want to hire someone who had apparently said horribly inappropriate things in a character&#39;s voice?  <br/><br/>AI generative learning tools should absolutely be regulated and limited in their scope.  Any art fed into their system should absolutely be consented to by the original artist, and the original artist should be compensated for their hard work.  AI tools could conceivably work well and even work alongside live artists needing inspiration, but they are not artists in themselves.  These programs are not trying to create something that evokes emotion or thought.  They are not transforming the art they steal into something important for humanity.  There is no commentary being made.  There is no analysis.  There is no education.  There is simply an imitation of the same exact goal that the original artist had: to create.  <br/><br/>Furthermore, considering how AI programs steal art from artists without turning it into a transformative work, and of course, the fact that AI itself is not human, I truly do not believe anything generated by AI should have its own copyright.  The original, human artists deserve the copyright to their own work that they put hours upon years into.  <br/><br/>Frankly, I don&#39;t see this issue ending with just illustrations or voice work either.  Other fields, such as writing and acting, stand to lose valuable human soul to these programs.  Regulations should be set up around AI as soon as possible, and preferably under the guidance of creatives and trade artists.<br/><br/>Once again, thank you so much for listening to what artists have to say about this issue.  It gives me hope that the humanity in art, and in the written word, will still carry more weight and value than anything generated by a program ever could.
