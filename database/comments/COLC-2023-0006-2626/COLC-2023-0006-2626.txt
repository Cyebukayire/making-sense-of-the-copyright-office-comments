As a film student, I learn that new work is created through synthesis of other works. For this to have genuine meaning and be &quot;art,&quot; it must have authorship of some sort behind it, which is lacking from any creation generated by AI. While there are merits to many use cases for AI as a tool to help artists, within the bounds of copyright, individual people, and not corporations, must be given freedom and ultimate protection over their works and ability to make a living off of their art.
