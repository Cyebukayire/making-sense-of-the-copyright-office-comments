I&#39;m Luke Aegis, a french Concept-Artist/illustrator. I made an Open Letter/Deep Reflection about AI in Art and Society. ( ~1 hour of reading )  <br/><br/>There is a French and English version, follow this link : https://tinyurl.com/AI-Deep-Reflection<br/><br/>It was important for me, I have now a clearer and more objective opinion on the subject, it was a therapy for me since I had an &quot;AI depression&quot; moment some time ago, just like many artists.... A lot of questions came to me day after day, and I tried to answer myself by doing a reflection.
