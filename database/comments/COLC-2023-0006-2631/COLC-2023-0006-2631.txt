I am a visual artist, and a young person finishing my degree. A number of my friends are going into the arts, into animation, game design, and music composition. I hope that the copyright office will stand by its decision to not allow the copyrighting of AI-generated material, in order to protect the wages and intellectual property of artists. I hope that the copyright office will enforce and strengthen the control of private citizens over their own likeness, in order to prevent new forms of abuse. <br/><br/>If the copyright system no longer required human authorship as a prerequisite of copyright protections, then human authors would be bypassed by large companies making media. Not only would this eliminate thousands of jobs, but it would result in a media landscape, in books, music, television, art, and movies devoid of humanity and self-expression. Art and storytelling provide life lessons, comfort, catharsis, and even challenge our morality and understanding of the world. Generative AI that can only produce derivatives of its training material would not be capable of the same deliberate intellectual reflection included in human art. <br/><br/>Generative AI models are often trained using copyrighted material. As a result, their outputs may significantly resemble copyrighted material. I have seen side-by-side comparisons of paintings with human authorship, and ai generated art with the same color scheme, style, or composition. Of course, human artists often learn from each other, and produce similar work. The difference is that generative ai directly condenses art into raw data, and reproduces version of it, often without the consent and almost always without the compensation of individual artists. Social media platforms have taken advantage of the boom in generative ai to turn their users&#39; outputs such as photography, art, writing, music, and videos into datasets. Social media users years ago did not post personal photographs or elaborate paintings with the intention of them being used to train ai. <br/><br/>Earlier this year, I believe, art hosting platform DeviantArt began turning user-posted art into datasets, which would be used to train generative ai models. Artists had to opt-out, rather than opt-in to the use of their art in these models. Deceased artists obviously cannot opt out of this service, and the work they uploaded to DeviantArt is being used to train potentially profitable generative ai without their consent. The same is the case for artists who no longer use the service, and are unaware of this change in terms. <br/><br/>Generative AI models can be trained to produce images or text in the style of specific authors and artists. If these images were protected, then specific artists who have trained their craft for years could lose work in favor of ai reproductions, trained on their own art. <br/><br/>As generative ai improves, it can be used to impersonate private citizens, to frame them for abusive and destructive behavior, and to create porn. There are already apps available right now whose sole purpose is to take the uploaded faces of young women, and generate nudes and pornographic videos of those young women. What happens if an angry or vengeful boyfriend posts demeaning deepfakes of his ex girlfriend? What will happen to her job, her reputation, her future? It is increasingly challenging to prove that this material is falsified. Essentially, now, anyone can be a victim of revenge porn, even if they&#39;ve never taken intimate images of themselves in the first place. Furthermore, as these images are not real, there is a legal grey area as to whether they would be considered revenge porn, the distribution of which is illegal in 48 states. <br/><br/>I believe that all individuals should be guaranteed significant control over the use of their likeness in generative ai models. This should include the ability to make copyright claims against deepfake reproductions of their voice and face, unless those deepfakes are explicitly produced for the purpose of satire. If young women could simply issue a copyright claim against this material when it is posted, it would spare them the lengthy legal process of proving that deepfake porn constitutes a crime in court. It would also protect actors, musicians, and voice artists from career and reputation-damaging ai misappropriations of their likenesses. <br/><br/>I have included a screenshot of the Google search results I got when looking up deepfake porn. First page, immediately available, advertising nonconsensual pornography of specific celebrities by name. Surely, abusing someone&#39;s likeness in this blatant way, for your own profit, should the right of publicity?
