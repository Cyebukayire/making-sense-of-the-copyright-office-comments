Hello, thank you for taking the time to read my comment. <br/>While I am not able to draw a picture to save my life I love writing. I love sharing the worlds and ideas I build in my head and being able to translate them down for others to experience and enjoy. <br/>I very much do not want AI to be able to read my works and create something mediocre based off of ideas I have worked so hard to create, to have your work taken like that is very disheartening. <br/>My life does not revolve around my writings in that I do not need this skill to pay my bills but many people do. People who are trying to make ends meet shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about if someone with an AI is going to steal their work and take food out of their mouths and the mouths of their family. What would be the point of paying someone for their time and energy if you can have an AI do it for free. <br/>With the right regulations AI could be a wonderful and helpful tool but unfortunately the route we are currently headed down is not a good one as many businesses would use AI over their employees. Resulting in lower wages at best and being fired or not hired at worst <br/>Thank you for your consideration and I hope that you please truly consider limiting AI in cooperate America
