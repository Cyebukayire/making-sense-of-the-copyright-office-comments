AI is not a creative, original process. It would not exist without the input of human creation. Stories. Images. Music. Even when created collaboratively, are at their foundation, the results of human experience and interpretation. AI may evolve, but it will always have it&#39;s essence in the unique voices and visions it bastardizes. If it writes a script, outputs an image, plays a song, it will always have its origin in human creativity. If I was to take 5 movie scripts and turn them into one, I would be an editor, not a writer. And that script will always be, at its core, the creative vision of other writers who should be protected from having their work hijacked. And to me, that script should never have copyright protection because it&#39;s not original. And that is how I look at AI: The output of hijacked work.
