The use of generative AI has only been possible from the use of countless acts of copyright theft. There are generative AI models that are being used for commercial applications that were trained using my copyrighted data, including my photos, videos, and writing. I have never consented to having my work used in this way, I have no way to have my work removed from the training data that companies use to train AI, and the generative AI that were trained using my data would be commercial competition if I wanted to monetize my works.<br/><br/>The use of copyrighted material to train AI without the explicit consent from the author or creator for commercial applications is copyright theft. The companies who are training these AIs should not be allowed to steal the works of millions for their own profits and then decimate the commercial industries they just looted.
