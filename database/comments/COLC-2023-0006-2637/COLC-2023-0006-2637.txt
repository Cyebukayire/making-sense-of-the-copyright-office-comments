AI generated content is no different than other artist generated content. An artist takes in the world around them, and then translates that and expresses it through their own viewpoint or in their own style. No art is truly original, as it is influenced directly or indirectly by the artist&#39;s environment. Many artists even use other art in their own work, resulting in a &quot;derivative work.&quot; However, it must be different enough that it becomes its own work. This is exactly how AI works. The &quot;artist&quot; states their vision through a prompt, that is then visualized by a learned model. Rarely does anyone use the initial output. It is typically an iterative process that involves many tweaks and edits to get the result to a point that is acceptable. I do think that AI models should not be allowed to generate content in another artist&#39;s exact style, as that leaves no room for distinction. Removing that capability, which some tools have done, would alleviate many concerns. That said, if the question is whether or not AI models should be allowed to ingest other artist&#39;s work, my answer is yes, as this is exactly what every one of those artists does, as they all have influences. If the question is whether or not AI generated content should be allowed to file for copyright, again my answer is yes, as it&#39;s no different than any other artist&#39;s filing.
