Copyright for Ai based work shouldn&rsquo;t be legal as an Ai created the art or work in question. This Ai cannot copywrite what it&rsquo;s made due to it learning and taking others art to compile what it creates. It is also not a human being so it cannot have the right to copyright it&rsquo;s work. And businesses that use Ai shouldn&rsquo;t have the ability to copyright this work either due to the fact that it was not created by a human being and therefore it is simply public unless it was created and copyrighted by a human being. Ai work cannot be allowed to be copyrighted due to how much it would create and push out any viable human artists. Putting billions out of jobs.
