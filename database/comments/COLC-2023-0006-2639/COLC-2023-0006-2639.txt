Please don&rsquo;t allow AI generated material to be able to be copyrighted. The future of too many people&rsquo;s livelihoods and careers are at stake. We know that AI have used countless other people&rsquo;s content to learn how to create what it does. I&rsquo;m not an expert by any means, but I know that corporations will exploit the use of AI in any way they can if you allow the works to be copyrighted. My own career is in danger of being replaced by AI. Please prioritize the words of real people over corporations when making the final decision. Thank you.
