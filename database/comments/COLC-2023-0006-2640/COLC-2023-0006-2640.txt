Never in the history of human existence have we faced the the paradigm shift that generative Ai poses today. The recent advancements in image and video clarity and accuracy with platforms like Midjourney and Sable Diffusion are a direct result of millions and millions of copyrighted source material assets that were taken without the original creator&#39;s consent, credit, or compensation. These generated works are now being used to market and compete in the very same industries as the creators who authored the source materials without their consent, credit, or compensation. Current regulation does not exist to prevent unwilling participants from having their work used in these training models. Current &quot;opt-out&quot; policies are insufficient when the work has already be taken and used to benefit the Ai advocates. Current data sets should be destroyed, and new training models created using only royalty free works, and works from those that choose to opt-in to this next training model. And those that choose to opt-in should be compensated for their involvement in said training. In short, the quality of generative Ai output directly corresponds to the quality of the source material input. And in it&#39;s current form, that process has violated the rights of millions of creators and is actively being used to compete in the very markets that made generative Ai programs ubiquitous. Regulation must act now and work with both Ai and creators to shape the future of generative Ai responsibly.
