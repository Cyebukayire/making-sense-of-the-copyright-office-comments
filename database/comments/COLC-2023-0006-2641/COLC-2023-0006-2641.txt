As a US citizen and author, I&#39;m against the use of AI in any artistic field, unless the artist(s) used to train the AI are properly compensated for their work and consent given for the work to be used. Artificial intelligence can be a powerful creative tool, but the images and/or words used to create it belong to others who should be honored for their hard work. I&#39;d like to direct your attention to &quot;Something in the Way&quot; by John Picacio and &quot;Not a Zero-Sum Game: AI vs. Art&quot; by Hana Lee in Uncanny Magazine for a nuanced view of the subject. https://www.uncannymagazine.com/article/something-in-the-way-ai-generated-images-and-the-real-killer/ and https://www.uncannymagazine.com/article/not-a-zero-sum-game-ai-vs-art/
