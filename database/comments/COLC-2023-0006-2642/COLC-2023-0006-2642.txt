Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment.<br/>I am an author - my livelihood depends in part on my ability to monetize my works, which are available to the public.<br/><br/>The Copyright Act places time limits during which an author has exclusive rights to their creative works.&nbsp;This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.&nbsp;Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright. <br/><br/>Personally, I find it terrifying that an AI, trained on my writing, using my words and syntax, might make its user money while I am struggling to do the same with my original works.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.
