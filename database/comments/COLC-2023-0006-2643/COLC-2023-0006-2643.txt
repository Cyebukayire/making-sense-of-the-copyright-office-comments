Artificial intelligence should not be permitted to use copyrighted materials to train without both fair compensation and written permission of the original creator.  The original creator should have the ability to specify what uses their copyrighted material can be put to, just as they can already do for non-artificial intelligence purposes.  Products created through artificial intelligence should disclose what sources the AI system pulled from in their creation.  <br/><br/>Because a product created by artificial intelligence was created by the AI and not a human creator, it should not be able to be copyrighted.
