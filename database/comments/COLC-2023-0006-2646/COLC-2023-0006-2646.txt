I won&rsquo;t attach files. Studio owned and by contract I can&rsquo;t share. But AI to enhance an image is ok. To generate artificial intelligence is not ok. Especially a &ldquo;person or people&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m a still photographer and union member IATSE Local 600. We also need to be paid for editing images after being on set taking images. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s no longer a living wage/ it&rsquo;s not viewed by major studios or low budget production companies to pay for work being done off site/ in our homes for the benefit of the project as a whole. Look into this! DOL needs be understand this is wage theft. If we don&rsquo;t comply we are terminated from the project.
