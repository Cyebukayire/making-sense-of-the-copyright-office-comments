Thank you for offering these questions up for public comment. I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in this topic and its request for public feedback.<br/><br/>The topic of AI training and copyright is quite important to me. I am an author and artist whose work appears on my website, and I am an avid supporter of my fellow authors and artists. A democratic society needs to support the creation of art.<br/><br/>And, in fact, the support of art is enshrined in our very Constitution Article 1, Section 8 requires Congress to pass laws, &ldquo;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo; <br/><br/>I would argue that permitting generative AI to train itself on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Copyright Act also places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works. This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work. Applying this sort of system to generative AI is fair; generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Thank you again for your time.
