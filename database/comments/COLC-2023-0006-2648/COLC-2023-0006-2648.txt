I think the reason generative AI is a bit of a bubble and the &ldquo;gold rush&rdquo; it&rsquo;s created is partly due to the &ldquo;free&rdquo; aspect of it. People think of it like free or cheap stick imagery. Why pay full market price for one image when you can pay the same or less for as many images you want? Well, I&rsquo;m submitting this comment to say it&rsquo;s because the data sets the AI&rsquo;s are pulling from are stealing images. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so much cheaper. If these models had to algorithmically reward the artists who&rsquo;s images the data sets stole from, I believe the cost would be comparable to just buying stock imagery. To me, it&rsquo;s somewhat analogous to the current writers and actors strike; artists are not being compensated for the distribution of their work. I look at a pricing model like Skillshare.com. The more minutes the content you created gets viewed, the more money you get, period. That would be the ideal system in my mind; every time an artists work contributes to a new AI generated image, they receive a respectable compensation. Or, data sets and AI tools could set a &lsquo;request for submission&rsquo; period when updating a data model and artists could submit their work if they wanted to, and depending on what gets accepted they receive a one time lump sum, if they agree to the amount. <br/>This is my biggest grievance with generative AI tools, artist compensation. It is not my only concern, but it is the biggest. A close second would be the moral and humanist concerns. It does get to the core of what it means to be human. Current AI tools have been compared to the printing press or the camera, but I think there&rsquo;s some more nuance that humanity has not experienced. These are thinking, doing the actual decision making process that humans must go through to express themselves. I believe the process is the art a lot of times. Iterating prompts is not the same process as studying light, form, color, sound; committing these experiences to memory to pull from. All our decisions and relationships in our life lead up to every decision we make including the process of making art. Submitting those decisions and time it takes to learn to a machine just feels deeply unsettling and un-human and not something I want to contribute to. <br/>I will admit there are benefits to generative AI imagery, for commerce or tedious visual effects compositing and other cases, but it feels to me a large net loss to humanity to let these tools grow unhindered. <br/>I would much rather these otherwise intelligent people making these tools contribute their effort to more directly beneficial things like medical research or environmental aid. I don&rsquo;t think making kind-of-cool images is the best thing we need to contribute our time to right now. <br/><br/>So in summary, I&rsquo;m writing this to implore those with decision making power to creatively control these tools, so that the humans and humanity that contribute to our lives and create relationships we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to have otherwise are fairly compensated and able to live a full life by making the art they love to make. It does make me a little depressed that I have to write that; begging to remain human.
