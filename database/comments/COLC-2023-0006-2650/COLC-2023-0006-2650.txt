Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment- this is a topic I have been worried about for a while now. I am a supporter of authors and artists, and recognize that it is important in a democratic society to support the creation of art.<br/><br/>There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.&nbsp; While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.&nbsp; To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter. It is a relief to know that due weight and consideration is being placed upon such a vital matter.
