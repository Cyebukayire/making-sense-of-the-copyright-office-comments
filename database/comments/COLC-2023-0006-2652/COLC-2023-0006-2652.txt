AI is something I am personally against, but if this is going to exist, than AI can&#39;t be stealing from other creators. AI Don&#39;t work hard, we do. AI isn&#39;t creative, we are, so I demand some respect and not have our work taken from us or stolen, other whys, why bother being a creative human????
