Hello and thank you for all of your work in this matter.<br/><br/>It seems obvious to me that if these models are trained on work for which the companies do not own the intellectual property rights, this constitutes theft. Alternatively, a company would be well within their right to train a LLM model based on works in the public domain, or works that they explicitly commission for the purpose of AI training.<br/><br/>Copyright protections for IP creators are essential to keeping a functional economy. To reverse or deny these rights would result in the destruction of numerous industries, individual livelihoods, and would destroy billions of dollars in future productivity. Over time, we would forfeit entirely our place as thought leaders in the world as the foundation of the intellectual economy falls away.
