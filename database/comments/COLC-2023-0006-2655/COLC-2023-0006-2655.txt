I am an author and, as an author, it appals me to know that AI was trained on the copyrighted work of other artists and authors without their consent. Without the expressed consent of the copyright holder, making a profit by generating a peice of work with ai which was trained on illegally utilised, copyrighted work is no different than if they had an intern at their company cut and paste sections of various copyrighted books together and then presented it as an original novel. AI generated text is theft as truly as any &#39;frankennovel&#39; cobbled together by a person would be.
