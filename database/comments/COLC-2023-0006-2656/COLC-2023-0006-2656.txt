i do not think we should be using AI for plagiarism, although it is smart doesn&#39;t make it right. AI should be used for more helpful and useful things like navigation when your lost, asking important questions or ones you&#39;re struggling on, and learning new things. AI is a smart tool that helps a lot of people but we shouldn&#39;t push our limits with it when we know what we are doing is wrong.
