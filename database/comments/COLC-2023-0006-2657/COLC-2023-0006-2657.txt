As a professional actor, voiceover artist, filmmaker, and creative, I&#39;m deeply concerned about the rapid advancements in generative AI that is trained on artists work without consent to create derivative work without compensation. This is deeply harmful to our entire industry. Already, we&#39;ve seen a significant loss of voiceover acting roles as computers trained on human voices replace real working actors, but the threat of our image being reused without consent feels more disturbing. In my opinion, copyright should cover datasets used to train AI and artists should be able to review those datasets and demand compensation for works derived from their original creative materials or choose to have their works removed from the datasets entirely. In fact, the entire system of using copyrighted images to train AI should be Opt-In and not Opt-Out. The datasets used to train AI should be required by law to be public and easily searchable with image or video or audio matching (similar to the tools that Facebook uses to block copyright infringement) and artists should be entitled to proper legal resource and compensation for unauthorized use.
