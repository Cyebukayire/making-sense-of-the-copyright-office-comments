Hi!! Thank you for opening this commentary form.<br/><br/>As an artist and writer&mdash;with friends in both the art field as a hobby and in the industry&mdash;we rely on our skillsets and talents to create and get paid/get attention to do so. Where AI comes in and harms us is that&mdash;especially with the union/guild strikes recently&mdash;that AI is pushing creatives out of the industry. Our art is being stolen to fuel AI artists who then create imagery without having to do the work behind it. It takes a lot to get to where you can rely on your art/writing as a freelance/independent job, and AI is quite literally stealing opportunities from us. I know many artists who had to put out public announcements that there were AI generated pages clearly based on their unique styles, and to ask people not to do so. It&rsquo;s harming our skills and our opportunities. More and more people will simply refuse to pay for a writer or for an artist to commission and take it upon themselves to do it cheaply over AI. Using AI to generate images requires theft in of itself. You HAVE to get a source from somewhere&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to &lsquo;think&rsquo; of a style for itself. It has to be told what to do. And these sources, more often than not, are fellow artists trying to sell their skillsets for careers. I believe that AI should not be allowed to use copyrighted products, whether it be artistic imagery or based on writing, to fuel their own AI generations. I don&rsquo;t believe AI should be given copyrights to what those images create either&mdash;the basis of AI is to take a multitude of objects, read the data, and correspond an answer based on the data given. None of this has a &lsquo;human&rsquo; input besides someone tweaking their keywords or feeding the AI information on what it wants it to look like. <br/><br/>Please hear us creatives out, and do not let AI use copyrighted imagery and do not give AI the right to &lsquo;copyright&rsquo; their images. Thank you.
