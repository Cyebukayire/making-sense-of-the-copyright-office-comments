I think AI generated content should be able to receive copyright and I say this as someone who has been a content writer for the past 15 years and whose content has most likely trained many AI. You can&rsquo;t just ask AI to write you a novel or write you an article. The technology isn&rsquo;t at that level yet. It requires heavy prompting and a lot of human effort. The generated text also needs fact checking (for non fiction) and heavily editing for both fiction and non fiction. It requires almost as much work as writing yourself but is less taxing on the brain and fingers. Due to the amount of work a human has to do when using an AI, I see no reason why AI generated text cannot be copyrighted.
