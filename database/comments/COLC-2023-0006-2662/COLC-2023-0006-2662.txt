Artificial Intelligence is not a friend of copyright. Quite the opposite, it is an enemy. It takes without regard, and corrupts the work of artists into &#39;products&#39; that steal not only the time and labor that the artist put into making their pieces, but the potential for those artists to sustain themselves on their art. AI should be heavily regulated and restricted as it is extremely dangerous to all forms of the creative industry.
