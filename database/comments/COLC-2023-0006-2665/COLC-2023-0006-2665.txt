I feel AI is very high risk currently as it&#39;s unregulated and advancing far too quickly unrestricted. I think that AI should be opt in instead of opt out because there are just too many sites for people who&#39;s works are being sampled can find and takes too much time to opt out, especially if a site tries to hide how you can opt out. If you have an opt in option, people can actively choose what sites/apps their works are being used and therefore shouldn&#39;t be a blanket agreement. Deceased people should automatically have their works opted out. An example of this would be Billy Kametz, a voice actor who&#39;s voice was sampled to create an AI voice and can&#39;t consent to opt out and based on most voice actor&#39;s reactions upon hearing their voices used for AI, would have opposed having his voice sampled for this purpose. I won&#39;t write much because I know more well versed individuals will also touch upon everything I&#39;ve mentioned but I hope you seriously consider heavily regulating and fining AI companies that are currently heavily knowingly overstepping their boundaries and taking advantage solely because there&#39;s no regulation regarding their AI programs.Please seriously consider very harsh restrictions. Thank you.
