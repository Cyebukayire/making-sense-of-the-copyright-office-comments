I think AI should absolutely be copyrighted for any work it generates whether it be anything from music to films. AI is harming everyone from artists who work and worked on music their whole lives to filmmakers and actors causing strikes and other issues that effects everybody including us as the consumers. AI has evolved so much that it can replicate almost any artist&rsquo;s voice down to the tone and can create a song out of this work. Many people have created songs using AI voices, such as a Drake and The Weeknd song, and this song was officially submitted to the Grammys. I think the artists have every right to copyright this song and the person who made it should either take it down or give any money earned by it to the artists. As for films, I don&rsquo;t think AI has the power to create a script as well as many scriptwriters and the technology as many filmmakers, but when it eventually does, I think they should be copyrighted to the max. It wouldn&rsquo;t feel right watching an AI generated movie especially if it was done very poorly as most AI work is poorly edited and can easily be distinguished. All AI work should be copyrighted and as it continues to evolve, I think the copyright laws should become even more harsh.
