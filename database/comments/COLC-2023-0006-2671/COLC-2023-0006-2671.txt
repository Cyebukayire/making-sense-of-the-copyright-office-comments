These are important questions--thank you for opening them up for public comment. I strongly support authors and artists, and know that it is important in a democratic society to support the creation of art, with financial support and recognition of the work that goes into that creation. There is a longstanding policy to encourage and support art and artists by allowing creators exclusive rights to their creative works during a set period of time.  If a work is under copyright, it should not be used without the creator&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.  Doing so would violate the creator&rsquo;s rights to control their work while copyright applies. The Copyright Office should adopt the position that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the creators of those works violates the Copyright Act. Thank you for the opportunity to address these issues, and for considering these comments.
