Thank you for opening this issue to public comment. Authors and artists deserve the right to determine how their work is used. Most AI programs have been developed by businesses, which should not be able to profit off somebody else&#39;s work without their consent. This is especially true if the AI is being used for commercial purposes, such as writing a film script.
