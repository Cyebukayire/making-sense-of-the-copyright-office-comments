As someone who works as a Production Manager of movies and television shows, I not only make my living from the initial payment for my work, but also from residuals that accrue when these shows are rebroadcast in a secondary market.   I make my living this way, as do the roughly 15 thousand individuals like me, who are similarly members of the Directors Guild of America.  This arrangement of residuals was negotiated years ago as a result of collective bargaining, and has allowed all of us to make a living wage.   If AI is permitted to ignore copyright, and to excerpt movies and TV shows indiscriminately, these long-held economic arrangements will be abrogated, and original work will be disseminated, divorced from the agreements that created it.  As a result, residuals, which are such an important component of compensation and health coverage, may cease to exist.   The Illegal downloading of movies and TV shows already has a negative affect - allowing AI to have free reign will so irremediably affect film and TV production as to make it impossible to make a living in production.
