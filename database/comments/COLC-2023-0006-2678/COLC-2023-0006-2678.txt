As an artist, writer, media content maker, and engaged citizen, I am deeply concerned about the lack of federal regulation and ethics laws regarding AI development and employment in the US. <br/><br/>The EU is eons ahead of America in its understanding of and legal framework for this potentially dangerous, obliterating technology. If we have the FDA and other regulatory agencies to oversee the release of potentially harmful practices and substances into our society, why isn&rsquo;t there a truly functional, legally binding, and consequential one for AI? <br/><br/>International competition is one thing; deciding what your population can safely use and not be brain-washed, corrupted, controlled, or rendered unemployable by is another matter all together. <br/><br/>I beseech lawmakers to have the courage and audacity to imagine and plan for the best and worst possible manifestations of this unbridled technology, for the sake of world peace and national security. An oppressively rigid hierarchy of tech haves and have-nots will yield hundreds of millions of angry, hungry, disenfranchised people, and no government will be able to govern effectively or benignly if and when that time comes. <br/><br/>Please be responsible, bold, and prescient now so we can avoid the end of humanity and humanism as we know it in the near future. The power-hungry, self-serving, often sociopathic or empathy-challenged tech bros do not embrace or represent humanitarian values, and should not be allowed to run the world. They are not equipped or qualified to redesign the intranational world order.<br/><br/>Please, elected officials of this presently still-democratic country, do your duty. Thank you.
