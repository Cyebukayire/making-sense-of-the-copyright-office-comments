Statistical programs that functionally similar to generative art, in the sense that a computer produces an image with some desired specifications and according to a set of rules, and to collage, in the sense that it draws from patterns observed in preexisting pieces of artwork (and often reproduces them in part). In this sense, it is a form of art unto itself, and I oppose any kind of blanket ban.<br/><br/>That said, I do not believe that users of &quot;AI&quot; image generation programs should be entitled to copyright protection for the images produced by this software, whether they designed it themselves or they are the end user of a pre-assembled piece of software. The inputs for these programs include swaths of existing pieces of artwork, which are taken in full for analysis so that the programs can produce similar images; in this sense, I believe that the &quot;training&quot; of an &quot;AI&quot; program falls outside of fair use doctrine and other legal protections for transformative works, because they make such extensive use of the original pieces. <br/><br/>Additionally, precedent (such as the example of a photographer attempting to claim the copyright for photographs taken by an ape, which has been cited extensively in discussion of &quot;AI&quot; and copyright law) shows that a human being must be involved in the creation of a piece of artwork for copyright law to be applicable to it. Inputting a series of images and prompts into an &quot;AI&quot; image generator is much like handing a camera to a monkey: something other than the &quot;artist&quot; did the actual work of producing the piece.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to note that the rights of the artists of the original pieces used as inputs for the &quot;AI&quot; are worthy of protection as well. I believe that artists should be backed by the law when they request that their artwork not be used to &quot;train&quot; an image generator, and I do not believe that &quot;AI&quot; art should not be able to be monetized without consent from or compensation to the original artists (barring, for example, the use of royalty-free images in the training of an image generator).
