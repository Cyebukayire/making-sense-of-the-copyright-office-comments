Thank you for your interest in this topic and request for public feedback. I myself am a writer, so the topic of AI and copyright is very important to me. I believe it&rsquo;s important to regulate the use of copyrighted works to train AI. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;&nbsp; Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating authors for the right to their writings is inconsistent with the Constitution. In addition, the Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.&nbsp; This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.&nbsp; Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright. The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act. Thank you for your time and consideration of this issue.
