As a writer whose work has undoubtedly informed ChatGPT and other AI, I do not consent to this use. I firmly believe consent should be actively required as an OPT-IN. Whether or not that is for remuneration can be negotiated between the artist/content creator and the AI trainer/organization.<br/><br/>AI-generated works should not be eligible for copyright except under narrowly defined conditions. For example, if a writer trained an AI solely using their own works. I propose referring to this as the SINGLE SOURCE use case. Other examples might include non-transformative copyediting and proofreading. You might consider these basic services applied to an already extant, human-generated work. I will not pretend to be an authority on the full range of conditions in which AI-touched works can remain copyrightable. Initial law and regulation should err in favor of human rights. Thoughtful measures should be implemented to avoid future political capture.<br/><br/>The conditions of copyright eligibility should be reviewed at such time as an AI achieves legal personhood. In this event, the AI would own the copyright as a fully protected individual and tax-paying citizen.<br/><br/>Liability for copyright infringement should apply to those who actively undertake the infringement. Those who only code the AI&#39;s capabilities should be found blameless, provided they require their clients to gain consent for any content training the AI. Those who train AI without consent should be held accountable be they persons or entities. Consent should be provable and auditable upon request. Those who use AI to create works that they wrongly claim to be original should be held accountable. Those whose work was used to train the AI against their wishes should form the class of aggrieved parties.<br/><br/>In the case of publicly available AI, those who train the AI should furnish an accessible and complete list of the authors, artists, or other sources they used for training.<br/><br/>In its current state, AI is incapable of creating original content. Every product of AI is an act of plagiarism. Any attempt to sell these products is an act of plagiarism. That AI can obfuscate plagiarism by sampling from thousands of works&mdash;presently without consent&mdash;does not invalidate the claim of plagiarism. Technically, even in the hypothetical case of wholly consented AI, the resultant work is still plagiarism.<br/><br/>In conclusion, real humans need protection from corporate entities attempting to steal their works and identities. These are real taxpaying citizens whose role in society is to provide outlets joy, creative expression, and understanding of the human condition. Depriving these citizens of their chosen place in society will have an inestimable effect on the fabric of our society. Allowing AI to replace humans as the primary source for understanding the human condition will not end well. Do not fail to act.<br/>
