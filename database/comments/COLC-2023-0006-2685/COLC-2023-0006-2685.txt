AI is the future, we must allow them to be trained and &#39;educated&#39; on ALL relevant content for human progress to succeed / accelerate.  Unless the AIs produce, word for word, pixel for pixel or waveform for waveform, copies of documents, pictures, recordings, etc., of what they have been trained on then this is no different than what humans do - we are born a blank slate, consume enormous amounts of copyrighted and non-copyrighted material, then go on to build upon everything we&#39;ve learned to push human progress forward via derivative works.  This is no different and should be viewed as no violation of copyrights.  What is happening here is akin to the luddites destroying fabric looms when they were first introduced because they feared for their livelihoods.  I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s how human progress happens.  No one should owe the authors of copyrighted works a living, a stream of residuals or anything else if it gets in the way of curing cancer, building starships and / or fixing our planet.  Progress must continue.  Period.
