I think that AI is completely inauthentic and because of this, deserves no copyright. It sometimes steals from other sources, is only limited by its programming, and yes, creates something else, but rarely something original. It&rsquo;s almost like cutting up famous paintings by Rembrandt and Picasso, pasting them together, and then expecting everybody to buy into the idea that it&rsquo;s genuine. In fact, certain types of AI creations should be copyrighted because it&rsquo;s essentially just craftily stealing. <br/>Similarly, even the impressive things that come out of AI are significantly unimpressive because we know that it&rsquo;s just a computer and its coding. As an artist and somebody who occasionally sells her own work, AI art feels offensive to authenticity (as well as other things like videos, writing, etc), and the idea that it should get its own copyright is laughable. Copyright protects original works. I think that in order for something to have originality, it has to have new ideas, which from what I&rsquo;ve seen, AI cannot produce. We appreciate art and other creations because of their humanness. If you look at a painting by a human versus a computer, the human will always win out. I think that this says it all: we will never value AI creations as much as we value human creations, so why copyright them the same? If anything, AI could be copyrighted in a much different way.<br/>
