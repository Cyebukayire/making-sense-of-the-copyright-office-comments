The opinions people have of artificial intelligence or AI in shorter terms is various depending on many things, like jobs, money, location, and etc. AI no question makes life easier as a student and a worker but I feel it&#39;s not fully your work. Many students use AI tools to create paragraphs and even full papers, which I feel should be copyright if given straight to your teacher without your personal change. I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s fair for students with access to high tech AI that could do all your homework or papers for you, because of the fact not everyone has access to technology like others and that it&#39;s none of your personal beliefs. I also don&#39;t feel it&#39;s fair when I write a whole paper that takes days of thinking and other people do it in twenty minutes without doing any work due to AI generation. I feel it also makes people lazier because they don&#39;t have to think as much or do as much. In conclusion, I think AI should be copyrighted since it&#39;s taking words from other sources and not giving all the sources that were used in an AI work.  <br/>-Alfredo Pantalone<br/>
