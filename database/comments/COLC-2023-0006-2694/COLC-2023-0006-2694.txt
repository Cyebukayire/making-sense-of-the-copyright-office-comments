Thank you for your work on behalf of creatives. I am a filmmaker, writer, and performer, and I am horrified to see the work of other artists stolen to &quot;train&quot; AI.  Your office exists to protect our intellectual property and the value of our ideas and creations, but AI companies have found a way to circumvent these protections by pretending that AI is simply &quot;learning&quot; from our work.  This is not true.  AI cannot create anything new - it is simply stealing our work and remixing it.  If these companies are not stopped, our work will continue to be stolen, and as AI&#39;s capabilities grow, the remixes will become sophisticated and refined enough to render human artists&#39; work obsolete.  I implore you to protect us from the work of unscrupulous companies who hide copyright infringement and theft behind technology language.  Theft is theft.
