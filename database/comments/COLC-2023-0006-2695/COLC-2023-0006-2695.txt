I believe that copyright law should continue to support human created work and not allow for the use of AI generated work in any capacity, even as it may appear similar in end product to fully human created work. My reasons are as follows:<br/><br/>- Companies who seek the skills of an artist, such as myself, will instead seek the offerings of another company for tax purposes. That company hired, in-turn, will knowingly take images that I (and many other artists) have uploaded to social sites for marketing purposes and input them into their generative algorithms to create &ldquo;similar&rdquo; work. Andersen vs. Stability Ltd in Northern California provides proof of this practice already in action. (A similar unspoken practice has been the entertainment industry norm of forcing an individual artist to form an LLC before employment.) In other spheres, OpenAI is now under litigation for using copyrighted material for use in their program ChatGPT.<br/>- Corporate entities and software companies are forcing this technology upon the artist community with claims of ease of use and increased output, sometimes with severe consequences if not adopted: 1) Educational &ldquo;enrichment&rdquo; programs using AI, requiring payment for participating; 2) Professional conferences hosting &ldquo;experts&rdquo; on the technology regardless of relevancy to topics being discussed; 3) Adobe forcing all its current users to download their update for Creative Suite which includes generative technology with images of unknown origin (as of Sept. 15, 2023); 4) Microsoft firing all employees who refuse to use the technology or bring up questions of its equity (March 2023). <br/>- In the interest of generating more income, corporations such as Amazon, have already allowed for AI generated work to be published and duplicated on demand regardless of authorized copyright. Once cited for their transgressions against known authors, they claimed innocence and published articles to reinforce their narrative of absolution&mdash;a claim of &ldquo;working closely with authors&rdquo; when the platform actively hides any pertinent company contact information. (See incidence with Jane Friedman, Aug 2023.) <br/>- There will be an even higher proliferation of plagiarism with no means of correction. As an instructor in the arts, I have seen this first hand. While I have been able to recognize the work as a direct pull from another artist&rsquo;s work, some colleagues cannot and refuse to seek corrections as it is too demanding of their time and positions.<br/>- Institutions of higher education have forcibly removed tenured instructors of merit in favor of mass educating students in programs that were advertised to them by major developers of AI generation software in order to increase their potential success rates in entertainment and other creative industries. (The college I have first hand knowledge of doing this is also governmentally funded.)<br/><br/>As many of us know, artistry is a skill learned by many years of experience with the materials used to create the work. It takes critical thinking, keen observation, and thorough analysis honed by consistent practice with our materials. Sidestepping this step in the process of creating, by using a tool such as generative technology, hands over the critical moments of discovery that art making requires.<br/><br/>The claims that an AI generator can give the user new ideas is also patently false. It simply takes the prompt, provided by the user, and generates a reconfiguration of work that already exists. It does not understand the context of the imagery used. It does not take into account the historical lineage of how a piece created stems from thousands of other works before it. And as a concrete example, it simply cannot make the correct choices for human anatomy with all of the millions of images it was trained upon.<br/><br/>To allow an individual (or a corporate entity) to use these tools to generate work that is copyrightable, is therefore allowing people who already devalue the arts as a whole to create wealth off the artists who had first created those works. The generated piece is not a collage, it is not a rough sketch, it is not even a parody&mdash;all of which require a level of human analytical skill and editing that an algorithm cannot begin reproduce.<br/><br/>I am hoping that my examples cited above shed some light on the real situation at hand. If the law favors those who would use AI tools to create their work, then the individuals who do not have the funds to advertise on a global scale, or even to stand in court against an offender, will no longer be able to create work as a reasonable means of self-sustaining income. And if a copyright is allowed for an AI generated product, it would also give the opportunity for an individual (or company) to gain the rights to a work done by someone else, without their knowledge, before the work can be copyrighted by the original creator. This last occurrence, I believe, is what has already been classified as theft of intellectual property.<br/>
