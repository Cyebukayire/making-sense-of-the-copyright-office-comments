Hello, and thank you for seeking comments on this issue.<br/><br/>I&#39;m a writer, both of creative work and of brand journalism and marketing copy. So I&#39;ve been following the proliferation of AI, especially generative AI like ChatGPT, very closely. I have multiple concerns about its use, but in particular I&#39;m concerned about the way in which it violates copyright. As you know, generative AI can only be trained if it ingests millions of words written by humans, and as such, these models have been scraping the internet for &quot;content&quot; and sucking up multiple copyrighted works without the permission of the creators, or any payment or even, in most cases, any acknowledgement of the original work. This includes novels and nonfiction books, short stories, poems, illustrations, paintings, photographs, comics, plays, scripts, films of all lengths, and other creative endeavors. This means that someone can now ask ChatGPT to write, for example, in the style of Margaret Atwood and get a decent attempt at an Atwood story. That seems dangerously close to plagiarism since the only reason the AI can do that is because it ingested all of her work without her permission or compensation.<br/><br/>Copyrights are intended to protect a creator&#39;s ability to make a living, as well as the significant time and mental and emotional effort it takes to make creative projects. Thanks to your office, not only have these projects always been protected, but the style inherent to each creator has been protected as well. It&#39;s hard enough to make any sort of living as a novelist or actor these days without AI destroying these protections and ripping off people&#39;s styles.<br/><br/>Generative AI creators should NOT be allowed to freely train their models on copyrighted work. They should not be allowed to make billions of dollars while stealing the words and images of the people who created the works they are using to &quot;train&quot; machines. We need your office to stand behind our country&#39;s creators and artists and not the tech industry moguls who are trying to suck the heart out of the arts. <br/><br/>For centuries, people have made art to explore what it means to be human. What can an algorithm that merely imitates and regurgitates other people&#39;s work possibly tell us about the meaning of life? What generative AI can do, however, is disenfranchise artists and creators by sucking up their opportunities and making it harder than ever for them to get fair compensation for the important work they do. Your office can help protect against that if action is taken before it&#39;s too late.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
