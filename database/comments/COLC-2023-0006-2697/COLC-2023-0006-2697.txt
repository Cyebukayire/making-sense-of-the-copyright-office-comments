I believe AI Generated material should suffer the same scrutiny as human generated material regarding the completed product when it comes to copyright infringement. Throughout our entire history, humans have used what we see to navigate the world. Artists have relied on other art to fuel their art. Our only failing has been being able to replicate what we see perfectly and consistently. If any human had the ability to replicate what they see with complete perfection, they would do it without remorse. The ethical problem arises when they pass it off as a creation of the original creator. If any one drew a picture of mickey mouse and sold it, is it infringement saying it&rsquo;s your picture of mickey mouse? Ai should be held to the same scrutiny as any other entity that reviews copyrighted material for inspiration, or training, or production. AI, for now, still must be curated. That curation is still personal innovation.<br/>As much as the internet has already allowed us means to review, rework, and reproduce a slew of material. Fan art and student work aren&rsquo;t considered infringement for the sake of study. We review so that we can recreate. AI provides us simply with a mirror and it seems we&rsquo;re afraid of looking in it. <br/>
