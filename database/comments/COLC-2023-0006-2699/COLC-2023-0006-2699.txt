As a publishing poet and author I am aghast at the manner in which copyrighted works have been ingested by so-called &quot;large language models&quot; to provide &quot;training&quot; for so-called &quot;generative AI&quot; -- which would perhaps be better referred to as &quot;recombinant AI,&quot; as it creates works within the framework on which it has been &quot;trained.&quot; I have experimented with ChatGPT and Bard and asked both to create jokes written in the style of famous comedians such as Steven Wright, Mitch Hedberg, and Rodney Dangerfield. In each case I was given examples that I knew to be plagiarized jokes, delivered verbatim by the AI. Were I someone unfamiliar with the oeuvres of these comedians, I would have potentially believed the AI wrote them. <br/><br/>It is my hope that I do not need to elucidate the reasons for this being of concern, but in case I do, such behavior going forward will chill the likelihood that creative professionals in any field will be able to make a living or generate new human-created intellectual products. We are already seeing the &quot;Hollywood&quot; studios seeking to capture the image and likeness of human actors to be used in perpetuity for AI modeling, acting, and potential other purposes. <br/><br/>I would like to see a strengthening of the copyright code to eliminate the possibility of &quot;large language models&quot; continuing to digest and regurgitate human-derived creative and scholarly works.
