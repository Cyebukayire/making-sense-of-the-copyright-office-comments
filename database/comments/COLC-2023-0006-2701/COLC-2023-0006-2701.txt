I believe, while generative AI art has potential and a place, it&#39;s currently being used in ways that I believe stifle human artists. These AIs must be trained on huge swaths of data, in this case art, and the art that an AI can be trained on is unregulated. Because of this, the individuals who own the AIs can, and have been training them on human artists intellectual property, as the AI owner can have plausible deniability due to the obfuscation between the stolen art, and the AI&#39;s generated art. However, those artists are still having their intellectual property stolen, and used to seed an algorithm with their artist&#39;s use of color, shapes, mood, and overall style of art. Even though it cam be argued that this is theft in a very small quantity, it&#39;s being done to thousands of artists daily. Because of this, I think that artists should have the right to make claims against an image generated using their art without their consent.<br/><br/>This leads to another topic of discussion, which is that an artifical intelligence cannot actually produce its own art. It takes a large data set, finds trends, links those trends to keywords, and then creates combinations of the images in that data set which are presented to the user. Without the library of data being provided to it, it cannot produce any images at all. While the owner of such an AI could claim ownership of the algorithm that created an image, if the image was generated using even one piece of art not in the public domain or owned by that individual, the image may have been generated by that algorithm, but only by using other, stolen art. Thus, in my opinion I do not think it should be possible to copyright AI generated art unless it can be proven that the individual who prompted that AI has full ownership of the library of images used to create the image.
