This is good to voice our feelings and perceptions of AI <br/>As far as I can tell it is Corporate and information gathering tech that helps and learns how to eliminate the need for a human being to do same tasks. It is the beginning of a new en slavement and will end up with We The People  have no control over our lives posessions etc. The basic premise of a Communist society <br/>we will own nothing and pay for everything we need to the corporations and AI will control what and when and how we live<br/>Not in favor of AI and know what confusion and lack of control it presents for us all. <br/>there is no stopping it but maybe some control of its far reach needs addressing for the generations to come<br/><br/>The use of computers and AI should be valid if the work is primarily done by a human mind and hand and assisted tech but not a tech that is the controller of work generated always a human final controller of outcome
