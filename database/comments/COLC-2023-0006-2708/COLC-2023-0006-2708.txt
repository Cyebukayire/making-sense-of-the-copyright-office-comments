AI models steal the works of human creators to &quot;train&quot; them. As such they do not truly create original works but merely aggregate the work of artists and writers. Not only should that disqualify AI created wirhs from copyright protection but the use of copyrighted material by AI models is both unethical and a violation of the rights held by the creators of the works these models are trained on. AI models should only be trained on public domain works and those which have the consent of the creator or their rights manager.
