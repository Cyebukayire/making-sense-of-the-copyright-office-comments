This is not a comment. I&#39;m not going to beg you to please not give away my property or give access to materials that I have worked on for years because you have a change in regulations. This is a notice that opening up copywritten materials to AI and big tech will be the beginning of millions of lawsuits as well as the end of any original content that doesn&#39;t come from a machine. If the U.S. Copyright Office and its department heads, managers, and employees give tech companies use of any copywritten material; written, designed, painted, sketched, photographed, ANY material that has received a copyright from your office, you will be sued. It will not be just the tech companies that will face legal blowback. The SOLE RESPONSIBILITY of the U.S. Copyright Office is to protect people from theft, both intellectual and artistic. If you aid and albeit the enemy (big tech and AI are the enemy of every artist) be prepared to be sued. When an individual or artist submits their work, they are paying you for protection from predators. &quot;It is inevitable that AI will replace writers and artists,&quot; is not a legal defense. If Congress were doing its job, they would be putting parameters on tech companies engaging in theft and holding them accountable. The closed-door meeting on September 13th hardly put guardrails on this industry. It&#39;s bad enough that artists are on strike for their livelihoods right now, but to even consider that we need to open this issue of &quot;AI and Copyright&quot; for public comments tells me that you are covering your bases for WHEN, not IF, you let the tech companies steal millions of peoples work as well as steal MY work. If the U.S. Copyright Office were serious about protecting people&#39;s property, you would be working with the Attorney General, the FBI, and Congress to stop big tech. This seems obvious but let me state it for good measure- the federal government, i.e., the U.S. Copyright Office, is not a for-profit business to be co-opted by Silicon Valley tech bros whose wants and desires supplant mine and my fellow artists and constituents... It exists to protect its citizens and their rights. In case I haven&#39;t been clear, you DO NOT have my permission to let ANY tech company, or any individual have access to any materials I have submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office. <br/><br/>I will be submitting this comment along with a letter asking for oversight into the U.S. Copyright Office to Senator Chuck Shumer and President Biden. I will also be submitting this comment to the WGA, the ACLU, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. <br/>#protectartistsrightsnow<br/>Darlene Conte, writer<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>
