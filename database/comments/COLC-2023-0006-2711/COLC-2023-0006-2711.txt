Unregulated AI usage in the field of creation will not only greatly impact the individual artist/writer but also the greater art field as a whole. If you have someone/some group generating &quot;art&quot; and then editing it to be even more vague, how can you tell who made what first or at all? On top of this allows for more content from major firms/studios to be easily copied/fraudulently made. Art also has to have the human element to be considered created, otherwise it it just regurgitated nonsense.
