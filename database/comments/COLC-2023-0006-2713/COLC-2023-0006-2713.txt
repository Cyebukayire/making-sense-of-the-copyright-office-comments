AI works should not be able to be copyrighted. Copyright law was constructed to protect artists and creators, and a computer&#39;s neural network is not an artist.<br/><br/>And, arguably much, much more importantly: Copyrighted works should not be used in the training of AI models without explicit, opt-IN consent from the creator. Opt-out systems should be made extremely clear with an easy way to opt out. Data scrapers should only scrape creations where the creator has agreed to have said creations used in the training of AI models.<br/><br/>Again, copyright law was created to protect artists, creators, writers, and makers. Just as I can&#39;t put a copyrighted logo on something and sell it, an AI should not be allowed to take creators&#39; intellectual works and recreate it without explicit consent from the creator. Copyrighted works in this context should include not only completely copyrighted things like logos and trademarks, but intellectual property and the creations of smaller artists.<br/><br/>Creation is human. Creation is life. Creation is not a neural network.
