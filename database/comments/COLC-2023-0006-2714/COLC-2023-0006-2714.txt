The value of a piece of artwork generated by machine learning (ML) technology does not lie in the prompt given to the ML model, nor does it lie in the source code of the ML model itself; **it lies in the data upon which the model was trained, and upon the training itself.** In the largest and most widespread ML models (e.g. ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc), the parties responsible for training the models **do not own the copyrights to the works comprising their training data.**<br/><br/>Likewise, I find it **inappropriate** that any entity generating works through the use of ML technologies claim legally-protected ownership of such generated works unless 100% of the training data used is either legally owned by the entity operating the model themselves, or otherwise obtained with **specific permission from its rightsholders to be used in machine learning.**<br/><br/>Use of a copyrighted work in the training of a ML project should not be considered permissible under &quot;normal use&quot; of a work. A license which permits an individual to copy and redistribute a work should not imply permission to use the work for training a ML project.<br/><br/>It is preposterous to assert that legal ownership could be claimed for a work generated through machine learning if the operator of the model has obtained appropriate licensing for less than 100% of the works used in training.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading; I hope that the right decision will be made to minimize the devaluation of artists&#39; works due to unauthorized use in ML projects. This subject matters deeply to me, not only as a consumer of media impacted by market degredation caused by the AI industry, but as an artist myself, as I&#39;ve published my own music/video games/software and want to be fairly compensated by any business entities deriving value from my works. Furthermore, as a professional programmer, I&#39;m not too excited about dealing with all the low-quality machine generated code that I expect to be dealing with in the coming years, but c&#39;est la vie.<br/><br/>(Addendum: I recommend the disuse of the nebulous term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; in contexts where the term &quot;machine learning&quot; may provide better clarity toward the relationship between training data, models, and their outputs.)
