The American Society of Safety Professionals is submitting the attached file for review by the Copyright Office.  <br/><br/>Our submitted white paper addresses the overall issue of intellectual property and copyright protections.  Our materials do not address the A.I. issue, but there might be interest from the Copyright Office since copyright and the development of consensus standards continues to be an ongoing issue.  We are not sure how A.I. would impact this in the future.<br/><br/>If the issue of copyright protection and consensus standards does arise, our overall position is:<br/><br/>***Access to Voluntary National Consensus Standards for Occupational Safety and Health***<br/><br/>ASSP supports the increased use of consensus standards in the formulation of legislation and regulation for occupational safety and health. Governmental agencies such as OSHA, CPSC, NHTSA and others should be encouraged to use these consensus standards as they provide an efficient/effective alternative to traditional public sector rule making.<br/><br/>ASSP supports reasonable public access to national voluntary consensus standards specifically referenced in regulatory provisions. However, this must be done without compromising the legitimate proprietary interests of the organizations that develop and maintain such standards.<br/><br/>ASSP opposes requirements that all such standards be made publicly available at no cost without permission of the developing organization.<br/><br/>ASSP opposes standards-developing bodies losing or having their copyright protections stripped due governmental incorporation of standards by reference.<br/><br/>Approved by ASSP Board of Directors on June 8, 2019<br/><br/>*******<br/><br/>ASSP Contact:   Tim Fisher, Director Technical Services and Standards Development<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>American Society of Safety Professionals, [ASSP]<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>TFisher@ASSP.Org<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>www.assp.org<br/><br/>
