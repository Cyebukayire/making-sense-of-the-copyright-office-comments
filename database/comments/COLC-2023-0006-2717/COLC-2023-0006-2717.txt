Generative Content created by artificial intelligence, uses base data that was illegally scraped off the Internet without any option to opt in and was taken without any consent. The artificial intelligence then uses that data to collage the stolen works into whatever the prompt maker is asking for. The AI doesn&#39;t not create anything new nor does it make things that are entirely original either, it does not learn like a human, it only takes images/passages made by humans and arranges them to appear new. Even if the art/passage is edited by a human I think the base being stolen and repurposed shouldn&#39;t make the final product able to hold copyright.
