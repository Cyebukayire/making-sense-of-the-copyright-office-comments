Artificial Intelligence by computers/computer programs should be open to the free market, because two or more computers can create identical artworks of music, drawings, and word manipulations.  Human beings who are infringed upon by AI can enact their rights to stop people from infringing on their previously protected artwork, and file claims against specific AI infringements, just as the copyright laws protect owners of copyrights against human infringements.<br/>
