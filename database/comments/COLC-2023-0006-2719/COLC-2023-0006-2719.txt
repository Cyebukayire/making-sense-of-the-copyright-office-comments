I believe that AI should be allowed to obtain data if there is no expectation of privacy, something akin to photography law. If the data is freely available on the internet, and the AI cannot recreate a work, it should be under fair use and should be considered transformative. If AI is used fraudulently to impersonate an author, the consumer using the AI should be at fault, not the company because the user is intentionally doing that would be illegal and could theoretically be done without the assistance of the AI. For published work, the AI should not be able to reproduce a whole book, but sentences of a book should be considered fair use, as with commentary and transformative work.<br/><br/>AI should be copyrightable if used as a tool. If the information is new and obtained by the user, the user should hold the copyright. AI companies should have the AI at least attempt to give its sources to the user so the end user can make an informed decision. If the AI is not sure that&#39;s where it got its information from, it should give a warning and tell the user to check its sources. For art, as long as the AI cannot reproduce the artwork, it should be copyrightable. Since the AI examines pixels and looks for patterns in artwork, it does not reference the whole art, and instead, creates new art. AI companies should be able to gather public data, and if they paid for a work, should be able to use it in a transformative way like everyone else.<br/><br/>It should be allowed the companies to force people to declare AI-generated content, but they cannot do so only so consumers can filter it out from their searches. That is an inheritable bias against the content, especially if they aren&#39;t allowing an author to declare what part of their product is or isn&#39;t AI-generated, how much is AI-generated, and so on. The declaration should be allowed to be filtered for or against, and the author should be allowed to specify more about how their story is AI-generated so that it&#39;s more transparent to the consumer.<br/><br/>Audio AI should be licensed if someone uses someone else&#39;s voice, and the training data, which should be public, is based mostly on that actor&#39;s voice. If not, it should be considered a coincidence. People should have to declare if a voice is AI so that there is no confusion about the source.
