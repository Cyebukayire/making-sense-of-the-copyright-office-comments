Generative AI recently for year has been nothing but theft of all creatives in many fields. They&#39;re scraped peoles data wheter it&#39;s copyrighted or not without asking the owner of the data nor compesate it. A lot of people get puts out of work from this exploitation. <br/><br/>Regardless of what these people say, artificial intelligence is not intelligence at all they can&#39;t think unlike human. They don&#39;t create. they only plagiarize human work. Unlike human artist they can&#39;t develop new artistic style. They can only take what already exists and put elements of it together in a way that responds to the prompts they&#39;re given. These AI tools are depended on trained large databases of training data with unimaginably large quantities and of course it&#39;s not ethical. There should be no copyright given to a program that is reliant on theft first. Giving such a program copyright sends a very disturbing message that theft and exploitation come first in America. Where we are supposed to have protections against such exploitation.<br/><br/>A company that develop these AI tools misleading a lot of people by telling us they&#39;re focused on real issues but in reality they&#39;re hyping up investor to keep the money flowing at a moment of rising interest rates and create new problem that doesn&#39;t exist before. The impact that generative ai cause: Further deskilling and devaluing human artist and other creator, plagiarism, unconsent nude photos and porn of women and children, fake news, raise in scam and spam, unconsent voice clonning, the AI use a LOT of electricity power and water, etc. I honestly didn&#39;t see any good thing happening from these generative ai, only problem occured. Consider to ban these type of generative AI.<br/><br/>Forgot to mention, chat gpt company also underpaid their content moderator from third world country.
