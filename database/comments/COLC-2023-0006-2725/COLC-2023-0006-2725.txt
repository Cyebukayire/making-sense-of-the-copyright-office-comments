AI should be regulated when it comes to copyrighted material the use of such work or derivatives of the original art should require that the original artist or producer of such data should be compensated for all data used in datasets that is not classified as public domain. Failure to do so is theft, robbing the original creator of choice to opt in to the use of AI generated media and derivatives. All work should be licensed though a regulatory committee in charge of oversight of such media use in datasets while training AI.
