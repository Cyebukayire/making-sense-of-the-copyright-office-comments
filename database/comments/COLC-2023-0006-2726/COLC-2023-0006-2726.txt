My name is Andre Yaniv, @andreyaniv on instagram. I love the US and I want to help the government eventually. Artificial Intelligence has an extreme impact depending on how it is regulated, it has the potential of taking away most jobs and allowing us to enter into universal basic income. Eventually copyright will be more obsolete than helpful because content won&#39;t be easily differentiated between real and AI and ways to fake it will be abundant unless the biggest companies find an endgame, I would like copyright to become more liberal, because I think it will happen naturally. I believe patent trolls are just slowing down the progress of the US. The US should be the dominant AI country if it wants to remain the most powerful.
