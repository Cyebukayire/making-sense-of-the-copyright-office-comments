I am a writer and a poet. I do not want AI to have access to any of my work without my permission, or monetary compensation in exchange for my permission.  Mining information is, in my opinion, stealing from the rightful owner. The issue as I see it is as a creater I have no protection in this tech endeavor. If AI pulls information from works online, owned by me, and creates an AI generated independent work I see multiple infringement issues including: plagiarism; my being cheated out of compensation; not citing me/the author and my work as a source. I would like to have options to opt in from AI technology mining as opposed to having to opt out. Copyright laws should center around protecting my work 1st, as opposed to allowing an AI program having cart blanche with everyone&#39;s works.   We don&#39;t allow individuals to take another&#39;s created work without citation, permission, and/or compensation. AI is a human generated program that directly benefits the company that utilizes the technology. Therefore, there must be expectations set immediately. AI Technology does not stand on its own - people are behind it. And they need to be held accountable. The publishing industry is well aware of expectations around copyright infringement and holds itself accountable. Why are we treating AI Tech companies any differently? They must be held accountable to the same copyright infringement laws the rest of us are.
