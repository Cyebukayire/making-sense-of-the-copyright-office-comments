AI Art is essentially art theft, for a multitude of reasons that I&#39;m certain many others are articulating better than I, but that I am no less aware of. They skim from existing art on the internet and very few artists are actually comfortable with this. But I am one of many that hate AI Art with such a passion that I don&#39;t want to post my art anywhere on the internet for fear my designs and concepts will be taken from me. At the very least, profiting from AI Art should be banned.
