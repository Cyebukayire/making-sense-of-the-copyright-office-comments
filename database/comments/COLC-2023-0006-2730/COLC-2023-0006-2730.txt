To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>Algorithmic Imitation Technology (AIT) is a major threat to the livelihood of creative professionals across the U.S. Rather than being used to enhance our work, AIT is being used to devalue our skills and replace us entirely. <br/><br/>Many AIT tools are trained using creators&rsquo; texts, images, and other content without their consent. These creators are not paid for the use of this content, despite the fact that training AIT programs would be impossible without the existing knowledge, hard work, and skills of these creators. Creators also do not receive credit for this process. Even if the texts and images used for AIT training are not stored within the program, the program will forever benefit from the creators&rsquo; historical work. In other words, the process for AIT training is a form of theft. It is neither ethical nor constitutional.<br/><br/>Once trained, some AIT some programs mimic specific art styles, voices, and human likenesses, often without the original creator&rsquo;s knowledge. This may force creators, many of whom already face financial struggles due to the low societal valuation of art, into further financial hardship. Businesses and individuals have begun to use AIT to make graphics and logos rather than pay the artists whose work trained the AIT. Major movie studios are already attempting to take advantages of actors and voice actors by training AIT on their likenesses and voices, using AIT to avoid the need for these creators in the future.<br/><br/>The hard-won skills of artists and creators are not products to be consumed. Although we as a society often place little value on works of art, these works still rightfully belong to their creators, who should always have the right to decide what happens to them. <br/><br/>I urge you to take a stand against the unethical use of AIT. Heavy regulation is necessary to prevent great harm to creators and the creative industry as a whole.<br/>
