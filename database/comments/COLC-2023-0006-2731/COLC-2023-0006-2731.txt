As a game developer, I use AI art, writing, audio, and code to push production values well beyond what would have been possible without them. If US copyright laws become too inhospitable, it will have catastrophic effects on American media companies&#39; ability to compete on the global stage.<br/><br/>The usage we&#39;re seeing is only the beginning. As knowledge of AI tools builds, they will completely reshape the way we create media. This goes for small independent businesses like mine, as much as it does for large Hollywood studios. The technology isn&#39;t going back in the box, and what matters now is adoption and refinement.<br/><br/>This is likely to be the largest economic transformation in living memory, and ceding it to other countries by making AI-assisted works impossible to copyright (or, worse, by preventing copyrighted works from being used to train AI systems) would be a grave error at a moment of exponentiation where every week matters, tantamount to banning transistors at the dawn of the computer era.
