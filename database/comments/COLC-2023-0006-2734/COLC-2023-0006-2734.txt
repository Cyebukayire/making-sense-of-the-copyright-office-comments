AI does not invent stories. Writer&#39;s do. AI is not &quot;inspired&quot; by the writers that have gone before. AI rides on the back of original content produced by human beings. Stories generated by AI should not be sold on Amazon or any other platform unless there is transparency that it is AI generated and payment is made to the writers whose work was included in the AI database. AI should certainly not be given a copyright for any reason. If AI can steal author&#39;s work, then a person publishing an AI story should be prepared to have it stolen too. Unless careful guardrails are in place, every grifter on the planet will attempt to make money off the backs of authors who do real work. As a side note, Tech people are money-grubbing idiots who are willing to set the world on fire for short-term gains and seem to have no ability to see that AI, if unchecked, will eventually steal the meaning of being human. We are creators, whether that be a book or painting or powerpoint presentation. We will never be fulfilled when our efforts are directed at directing AI. I predict a rather sad future for the world, as I do not think human beings, and especially not politicians, are smart enough to save themselves.
