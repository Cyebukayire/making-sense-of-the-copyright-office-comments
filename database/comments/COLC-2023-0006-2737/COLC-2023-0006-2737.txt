The very nature of human existence is creation and what that creative work does to the artist and the audience.  It is the unique difference between humankind and the rest of known life.  Artificial Intelligence (as it currently exists) is purely derivative, and while ultimately will not take the place of wonderful creative work, will be destabilizing enough to destroy countless jobs and lives in creative work along the way.  Humans will never stop creating, and will never stop looking for new inspiration and new stories.  AI does not threaten this, but it does threaten the workforce.  As intellectual property rights are specifically about encouragement of new creation, AI must be controlled to keep from discouraging creation.
