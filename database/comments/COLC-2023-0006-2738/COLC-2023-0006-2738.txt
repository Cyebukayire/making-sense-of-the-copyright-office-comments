As a freelance artist, I firmly believe AI generative imagery cannot and should not be given any legal or copyright stance in the United States - nor the world. Art, writing, music, film, all of these creative and artistic endeavours are uniquely human endeavours - automating this utilising a technology that is built upon the backs of artists and people alike unknowingly is both grossly violating to the aforementioned parties and a spit in the face to all of the creatives that built these industries from the ground up. <br/><br/>The United States of America is rich with art, diverse culture and creativity birthed within our country historically and daily. Hollywood is synonymous with filmmaking as a whole worldwide, something that was created by wildly skilled and talented humans with a vision that cannot be matched by an algorithmic computer program that only is as threatening as it is due to the very database that most generative AI engines are built off of. The databases themselves are already known to have been based off of a database made for RESEARCH PURPOSES via web crawling, thus it is rife with copyrighted materials and personal information. There have been reports of medical documents, personal photos, copyrighted materials from major corporations IPs, and so much more within these databases. <br/><br/>As it stands, OpenAI only has a submission form where one can upload an image found within the database to request removal, it is abhorrent that all websites and AI programs have only a way to opt out of future usage of materials, when it should have been OPT IN from the beginning. The only way to create a solution for this major issue is for royalty-free materials &amp; licensed material with written agreements and properly paid royalties to be the sole data that the AI can train off of. This would mean all AI programs must be completely trained from scratch with all current databases being wiped if they are to be public-facing and/or for commercial use. <br/><br/>The fact that some of our leading companies that became as large as they are due to our creativity as artists and writers are now threatening our livelihoods with the replacement of us via AI generative material is revolting. Disney, as a major example - a homegrown American company - is doing exactly that, having even released a TV show using AI for its intro (Secret Invasion). Disney has been a leader in filmmaking, revolutionising an industry and inspiring so much creativity from its very inception, and yet now they&#39;ve fallen so far where they&#39;d rather AI regurgitate stolen information to create &quot;new&quot; entertainment. I find this to be very very shocking, and it is a threat to the freedom of America. If we are not free to be creative, if we are replaced by machines for jobs that quite frankly are wanted and passionate careers, then we are left to fight for hard labour jobs and retail swill with little to no fulfilment in life. This would leave so many with no money to circulate, and on top of that, it would completely nullify the creative industries as so many of the things we use and interact with in our day-to-day lives do require art as a component.<br/><br/>Art is not just entertainment and frivolity. Art is our product design, our interior and exterior architectural projects, our automobiles, machines, clothing, graphic design and advertising, the very interfaces we interact with within computers and technology. All of this stands to be lost and replaced by this &quot;future&quot; that Silicon Valley programmers applaud. A technology that is built off of our hard work with no compensation. It is insidious what these companies are doing to sell this product, via apps that &quot;turn your selfies into comics&quot; or filters on different social media apps, not to mention Snapchat introducing MyAI which has already led to some less-than-ideal interactions with the AI due to it being easy to mitigate its filters and limitations. They play off of people&#39;s ignorance of what this technology truly is, they are counting on the general public&#39;s need for instant gratification and for something novel. For AI to be successful, the people propagating it break down detractors&#39; arguments into being scared of the future and scared of loss of their livelihoods. Arguments such as &quot;Well it&#39;s already here to stay!&quot; and &quot;Artists need to learn to use it or be left in the dust&quot; serve to belittle the severity of what they have done. <br/><br/>To summarise, generative AI algorithms are built off of millions of copyrighted images, copyrighted writing and text, and are only as successful as they are currently due to the massive theft that these programmers are KNOWINGLY committing. It is anti-American, anti-human, and anti-progress. Technology should help us, and yet I see that this technology is only harming us and making things WORSE.
