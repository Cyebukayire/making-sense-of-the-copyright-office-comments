I&rsquo;m writing to strongly advocate for an open and flexible approach to copyright issues involving AI-generated and AI-assisted content. It&rsquo;s becoming increasingly clear that traditional models of copyright are insufficient to address the rapidly evolving landscape of content creation enabled by AI.<br/><br/>AI-generated and AI-assisted content should be considered transformative by nature. These technologies take inspiration from an array of sources to produce something entirely new, which is not unlike any human creator who creates new works comparable to the artists and authors who influenced them the most. Restricting the freedom of AI in this arena not only inhibits technological advancement but also stifles the creative possibilities that these tools can offer.<br/><br/>I argue that rather than trying to fit AI-generated and AI-assisted content into pre-existing copyright models, we should be developing new, more flexible guidelines specifically designed to accommodate this unique form of content. A rigid application of traditional copyright law could inhibit innovation and deter creators from exploring the full potential of AI technologies.<br/><br/>One proposal could be the creation of a &quot;Fair Use for AI&quot; provision within copyright law. This provision would recognize AI-generated and AI-assisted content as transformative works, provided they meet certain criteria:<br/><br/>1. The AI-generated content must not directly replicate or closely imitate the original work in a way that could cause marketplace confusion.<br/>  <br/>2. The AI system should not be trained exclusively on a specific copyrighted work or set of works by a single creator, to ensure a broad array of influences.<br/><br/>3. A reasonable effort must be made to attribute inspiration or source material, where applicable and possible, without needing to cite every tangential influence.<br/><br/>4. Commercial uses of AI-generated content that directly compete with the original copyrighted work should be more scrutinized, perhaps requiring some form of licensing or revenue-sharing agreement with the original creator. I realize that this point is the real crux of the issue, but I also think the previous three points shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked in the crossfire and, in fact, should be used to inform the debate over this point.<br/><br/>By adhering to these criteria, AI developers and artists could generate new works without the fear of infringing upon existing copyrights, while original creators would still have legal recourse against direct imitations.<br/><br/>It&#39;s crucial that we embrace this form of content creation for what it is: a revolutionary method that challenges our conventional understanding of authorship and originality. The focus should be on fostering an environment where both traditional and AI-assisted creators can thrive, without burdening the latter with outdated regulations. This approach recognizes that new forms of creation don&#39;t render traditional methods obsolete, but rather add to the richness of the artistic landscape.<br/><br/>I greatly appreciate the U.S. Copyright Office&#39;s commitment to studying this important issue and am hopeful that your final recommendations will acknowledge the unprecedented creative and technological potential that AI offers.
