AI-generated outputs are nothing more than summaries of existing intellectual property, and should be treated as such.  Although softwares like ChatGPT have huge potential for helping English language learners create better paperwork, and people all over craft better emails, they are not creative in their own right.  Any author whose work was fed into machine learning models without their consent should have the right to have that work removed, or else receive a portion of royalties from sales of the relevant product.<br/><br/>No AI-generated output should be copyrightable, nor should it fall under patent law, nor should it ever be accepted as any form of creative output in literary magazines or scientific publishing.  The technology itself is already seeing misuses in classrooms and legal briefs, and needs better regulation to prevent these issues from occurring.
