I am very glad to see that the content generation of computer algorithms is being checked by governmental agencies. I think that a preliminary examination of the state of artificially created art will find that the use of copyrighted materials in image and text generation is extremely dubious, and I hope that this probe spurs further action against what I see to be brazen theft automated.
