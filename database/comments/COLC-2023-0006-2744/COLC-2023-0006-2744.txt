AI is akin to interacting with a polite person. It asks you how you are doing but it doesn&#39;t mean it. It doesn&#39;t want a response and wouldn&#39;t know what to do if it got one. It is just saying what people say. Unfortunately, artists take &quot;How are you?&quot; quite seriously. That&#39;s what art is.
