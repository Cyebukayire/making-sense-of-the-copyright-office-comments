1. As described above, generative AI systems have the ability to produce material that would be copyrightable if it were created by a human author. What are your views on the potential benefits and risks of this technology? How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, technology developers, researchers, and the public?<br/><br/>The works produced by artificial intelligence (AI) are no more involved by a human author than typing in a query to a search engine. Are searches in Google or DuckDuckGo or jstor copyrightable because a human typed in the words? As most, if not all, AI generated datasets are trained on copyrighted works that have either been submitted willingly or scraped unwillingly from dozens of social media sites, and some &quot;artists&quot; have claimed to be able to mimic works of famous artists or deceased artists, which is a desecration of their work and memory. I firmly believe that any work created through generative AI, be it visual, audio, text, or any other form of art, is not copyrightable because there has been hardly any involvement from a human author beyond typing in a set of prompts. AI is not actually intelligent. It is plagiarism. All these works being regurgitated out are just bits and pieces of other work, there are no original works being created in this fashion.
