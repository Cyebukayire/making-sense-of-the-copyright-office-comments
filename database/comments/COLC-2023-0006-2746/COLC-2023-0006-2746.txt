Quite frankly, I think AI-generated works should not be copyrightable at ALL, even with significant human input. AI basically generates collages made from datasets after being given a prompt, and its trained to be able to tag the images in the dataset as a certain thing (EX: It will tag a realistic drawing of a plane as &quot;plane&quot; or &quot;airplane&quot;) Nothing it produces is actually original, but is instead derived from dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of images or pieces of writing(many used without permission from the company or creator, and some even copyrighted material) in accordance to a prompt inputted by a user. AI is actively stealing jobs, and while it has potential in the realms of art and writing (For example, being used to help change the tone or complexity in a piece of writing, or being used to generate specific references for artists to use,) I have seen it actively used to harm creators. Both copyrighted and non-copyrighted original works have been scraped off the internet and used in datasets without the creators permission already, and I have even seen the art of a dead man be shoved into AI and used to generate images near-identical to his own style and then put up for sale not even a full 24 hours after his death was announced. Allowing AI-generated works to be copyrighted is basically allowing copyright infringement to happen because almost every piece of art or writing generated by an AI with a single piece of copyrighted material in its dataset is using that copyrighted material, no matter how small it may be. It should not be allowed, not now, not ever.
