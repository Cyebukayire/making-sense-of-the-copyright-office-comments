Anything made by not-a-human should be public domain and free for all to use. AI would have nothing to go off of without the creative contributions of people and the people who do the creating should get the monetary compensation from their work no matter what AI does with it afterwards. Additionally, every time a likeness is used, the original person who poses for AI to copy should get compensation same as if they had done the acting in person-every film or episode or song or image they get paid a royalty. Everything made with AI should have an identifying mark somewhere in the code.
