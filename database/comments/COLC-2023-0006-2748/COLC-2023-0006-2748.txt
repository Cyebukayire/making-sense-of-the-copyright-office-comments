AI should not be copyrighted on the account that the only way it can create is to lift from real people&#39;s work. It is a lazy way to undermine hours of hard artistic labour for instant gratification. It is the equivalent of Leonardo da Vinci copyrighting the Renaissance style. AI cannot exist without stealing from a real person. With such examples like AI voice, many creators feel violated hearing their voice say something they never said. They are not even properly credited, given merely a shoutout if they&#39;re famous enough. AI is the death of human made creation.
