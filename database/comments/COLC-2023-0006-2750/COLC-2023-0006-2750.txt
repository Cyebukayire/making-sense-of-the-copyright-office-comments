Quite simply unless copyright is enforced on AI crawling and training then copyright itself will cease to exist along with the U.S. Copyright Office.<br/><br/>If you are unable to protect individuals from large scale companies doing whatever they want because &quot;might is right&quot; and because they believe it is easier to seek forgiveness than ask permission. Where these companies ignore Copyright and IP entirely in order to plunder others content in order to make a machine aims to replace human content creators entirely and force them to compete with a version of themselves that charges pennies and much faster, there will be no new content to Copyright. There will be no protection for American invention. There will only be a race to the bottom.<br/><br/>They take IP and create derivative for sale. Like cheap knockoffs. This is not &quot;fair use&quot; nor should it be.<br/><br/>They seek to have &quot;opt out&quot; which they have then demonstrated they are unable and unwilling to actually do, they place impossible hurdles on content creators to be able to opt out.  This should be made illegal, all ML training material must be opt in with the default always as opt out, just like tracking cookies on the web.<br/><br/>AI companies are out to eliminate copyright and IP entirely, while building a moat around themselves by eliminating competition such as Open Source through regulation based on a fantasy bogeyman of AGI designed to scare those who they see as old infirm fools in Washington. Prove them wrong.<br/><br/>Before you get worried about falling behind the rest of the world by clipping the wings of AI.  This is simply not going to be the case.  The automation that ML brings doesn&#39;t bring increased profits, it eliminates market leverage which means to businesses that their competitors and clients have access to the same automation tools as them, which require no skill and are cheap. Everyone becomes a middle man. They will simply circumvent all the way up to the company delivering AI, following tragedy of the commons. Those AI companies will not create the same liquidity nor profits as the industries they replace. In fact you should expect to see 80% of your GDP disappear with a commensurate joblessness number. The government will not be capable of averting a complete collapse of the US dollar, the economy and the government itself.  Remove the direct profit from AI and its use and the economic benefit of AI will be much higher. It stalls the race to the bottom.<br/><br/>Equally it is impossible for AI to be used by government in an ethical way. It provides one way filtering that will always lead to autocracy through lack of transparency and accountability. It will be used to replace bureaucracy without understanding that the purpose of bureaucracy is to diffuse power and slow down process to avoid reactive decision making and policy. To protect citizens from government as much as government from citizens.<br/><br/>The cleanest solution is tax all profits derived from AI at 100%.  Constitutionally ban government usage.  International treaty on AGI if it still scares you.<br/><br/>Before Washington realizes that is the necessity though please enforce the law when it comes to copyright with regards AI.  Do not allow the content it pastiches together from others works to be copyrighted, do not allow AI corporations who profit from AI to train their models on copyrighted content. Enforce that for all copyright content, not just registered copyright. They cannot be allowed to merely pay a small fine, they must remove that content fully from their training data and the weights of the models they use, they must gain express permission and pay recompense to every copyright holder.<br/><br/>This is time to slap wrists. In a substantial way. Don&#39;t be conned into the belief that any company is too big to fail, the loss of MS or Google is nothing, SV is full of startups ready to take their place, it is a land of innovation and solutions... and IP.
