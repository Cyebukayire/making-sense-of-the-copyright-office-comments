I grew up learning various art media, and this has continued throughout my life. I&rsquo;ve taken classes ranging from color theory, photography, sculpture, comic and sequential art, poetry, creative writing, 3D design, as well as Adobe&rsquo;s Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and others. <br/>The thing I&rsquo;ve found to be in common to all these art forms, is the creative judgment of the artist. I&rsquo;ve played around a bit with generative now, not much, but enough to realize that while prompting these AI programs requires a different skillset, that creative judgment is as essential as with creating a work in any medium. <br/>To me, if a work involves that creative judgment, then it&rsquo;s that person&rsquo;s art, regardless of tool choice, and that person deserves to own copyright in it. It&rsquo;s the creative judgment that makes something intellectual property, because it is the creation of their intellect. The AI tool may draw on information from existing works (and I don&rsquo;t have an answer regarding copyright as pertains to training AI), but the creative judgment of the final result is still that of the person using the tool. <br/>As I understand it, the reason for copyright existing at all, is to incentivize people to create art. Knowing any work I create utilizing an AI tool puts my ownership of my work in doubt has discouraged me from seriously working with these tools. I don&rsquo;t want to spend the time and effort to create something knowing I won&rsquo;t have any say in how my work is then used by others. I want to publish my work, and I&rsquo;ve spent years learning and developing both my writing skills and my business knowledge. I can see so much potential to be able to do more of what I love with the assistance of AI tools, but I intend this to be a business and I&rsquo;m not going to jeopardize the foundation of that business, which is my right to my intellectual property, my copyright. <br/>Thinking about copyright regarding the training of AI tools, I still don&rsquo;t have answers, but I hope that when thinking of that purpose for the existence of copyright, to incentivize people to create works of art, that the people who contribute in &ldquo;small&rdquo; ways are also granted consideration. I&rsquo;ve heard that Hollywood studios are putting in contracts offered to people for work as extras, that the studio then gets to use their performance, and their likeness, for training AI. Which could result in there no longer being work as an extra, and as that&rsquo;s how most hopeful actors get their foot in the door for larger roles, that&rsquo;s a big issue. So is signing away the right to one&rsquo;s likeness. There are just so many cascade effects things like that, and it&rsquo;s impossible to know all the ways it will impact your life if you sign something like that. <br/>There are ways to balance protecting existing works and their creators, future works and creators, and the AI tools&rsquo; requirements for great amount of &ldquo;grist for the mill&rdquo;. I hope these thoughts help.
