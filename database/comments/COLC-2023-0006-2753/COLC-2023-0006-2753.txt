EVERYONE should be concerned about the AI threat to the creators of art &amp; intellectual property, and their creations. It will affect each of us at some point. In its simplest definition it is theft in the form of misplaced entitlement, like any criminal who, upon seeing something tangible of appeal, decides to help himself. Intellectual property ownership, be it of anything literary, musical, art, etc., is just as valid as any physical item, and should be fiercely protected from such blatant thieves with the full force of law.<br/>
