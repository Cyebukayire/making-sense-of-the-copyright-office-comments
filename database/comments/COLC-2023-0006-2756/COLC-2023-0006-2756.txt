&quot;Digital watermark&quot; of AI generated images should be clearly defined as non copyrightable and for ever stay in public domain. Tracking the source of creation should not be used as a work around to establish any claim of copyright. They should be defined as an ID which, as an identifient does not provide rights to own, just like a driver license ID does not provide specific right to road ownership claim. Instead, a driver license provide rights limited to comply with regulations when used driving on roads.
