Training AI by using materials created by humans without acknowledging and adequately compensating them for their work is unethical and makes no sense economically. If AI cannibalises content and then AI displaces humans, all without compensation, who will the future consumers be - the AI? A fee should be paid to the artist/writer/content creator for use of their work and then they should receive royalties every time anything anywhere is created using an element from their original works.
