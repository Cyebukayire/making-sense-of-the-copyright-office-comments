Artificial Intelligence currently poses a large threat to several artistic communities because of it&#39;s learning mechanisms. AI learns from resources that have been fed into software, and it regurgitates information based off of patterns. While the regurgitation of information can lead to potential ideas, there is no accreditation of the original thoughts, an attribute that is REQUIRED for several documents written by humans. Without accreditation to proper authors and resources, a person&#39;s work is considered plagiarism. A machine should be held to higher standards than humans, so it should not be allowed that the machine can break these rules.<br/><br/>Artists and writers of multiple fields rely on their ability to write, draw, and create to push them through their own fields. The concept of plagiarism is so important because it is what allows them to continue to create and push their talents forward. There is a level of understanding with creation that cannot be replicated with AI. Creative fields are already allowed to copyright their own works, precisely because allowing others to take advantage of the work would disadvantage the original creator in their own workplace. Artificial Intelligence should be treated no different, and direct permissions should be expressed before AI is allowed use the works of creative entities.<br/><br/>AI is very powerful and has several uses that can grow to become something powerful. But use for the recreation of creators is not the way AI should be taken. Individuals have the rights to their creations, and simply because a machine created by a human is using them instead of a human should not change any aspect of this.
