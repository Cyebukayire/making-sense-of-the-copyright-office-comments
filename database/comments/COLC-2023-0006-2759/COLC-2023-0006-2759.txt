AI generated material has nothing original or creative in it. It is a frankenstein mess of stolen work from several human creatives mashed together in some conglomeration until it resembles something akin to what was asked of it. It steals the hard work and passion of human creatives and rips it apart before glueing pieces together like a collage. One cannot and should not attempt to copyright something that is merely an amalgamation of stolen works and ideas. AI generated material has no humanity, no passion, and no creativity. It is only thievery and a pale imitation of the human desire to create.
