I oppose allowing AI companies and others to use any author&#39;s work without compensation. This constitutes intellectual theft, and also contributes to the tsunami of misinformation that&#39;s already endlessly repeated online. I oppose this theft of work even when manuscripts, in part or in whole, are freely available online. In the past, Google Books has scanned and made available works that were still under copyright, albeit out of print, without compensating their authors or publishers, and these copyright violations are still being remedied. In addition, many authors allow some of our work to be displayed online, either to publicize our work through our author websites, or to (in my case) as a public service. This does not justify allowing large corporations or even nonprofits to monetize any author&#39;s work by putting it in the blender of AI and then selling or providing that mediocre, generic and often false product to end-users -- who will then fail to hire writers and editors, or lay off staff. And when AI-generated text contains falsehoods that are already repeated online, it adds legitimacy to them -- because too many end-users believe AI is actually intelligent and can distinguish between accurate information and disinformation. It can&#39;t.
