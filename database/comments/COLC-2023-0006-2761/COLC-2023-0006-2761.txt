1. Artists and any creators should have the choice to either not be included in training data or compensated if their work is included. For those already included, they should be compensated since it&rsquo;s been in use and any work already created cannot be retracted. <br/><br/>2. Given that AI training data is not infringing on creators, then copyright is still a bit challenging, without further manipulation. For example, in Midjourney, if I use a prompt with a specific &ldquo;seed&rdquo; as does someone else, the same exact image will be created. At the rate images are generated, even if the law stated that the copyright goes to the first creator, it still be be problematic to either sue, or keep track of infringements. <br/><br/>However, if you use the an analogy to stock photos/illustration, there could be a model in which seed/prompt combinations are purchased for copyright. <br/><br/>3. I think the way I&rsquo;m using AI, as a visual artist, should definitely be copyrightable. Outside of what I post in social media, I never use Gen AI art directly. It is either heavily manipulated or use to combine or manipulate my original images. In this use case, I see it as a tool, no different from Photoshop, or a paint brush for that matter.
