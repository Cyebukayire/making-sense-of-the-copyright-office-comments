AI in the fields of creative discipline is theft of intellectual property. It has no way to create new content unless it steals from existing content to reconstitute it. It directly damages an artists&rsquo; ability to make a living for themselves because it robs them not only of their work, but also proper recognition of the use of it. This applies to everything from writing to acting to art, etc. In the case of film and TV, it robs skilled crew members of their livelihoods. If AI can create a Wes Anderson lookalike piece, it has now eliminated: directors, support staff, scripties, costumers, tailors, breakdown artists, costume designers, tailors, hair and makeup, gaffers, grips, electrics, props, set dressing, art department, transpo, studio space (and related businesses), catering, etc. That&rsquo;s a big deal. And that&rsquo;s not just a film problem. We all know corporations are going to train it to replace people and the actual need for real estate to cut their bottom lines and maximise profits as much as they can.  AI is a tool, but its potential for abuse, to the detriment of a workforce  is huge. It absolutely needs to have strong regulations to prevent this. AI should be used to aid people in research processes, development of models/scenarios, or development of technology, but not to replace people entirely.
