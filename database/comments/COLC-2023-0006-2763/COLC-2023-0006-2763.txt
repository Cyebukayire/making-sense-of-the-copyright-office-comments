We need a strong set of ethics to govern AI and to protect the human beings who create the work that AI is aiming to plagiarize. <br/><br/>I am a writer who has been honing her craft for years on end. I am a filmmaker who has been making feature films for 25 years. Artificial Intelligence is threatening my livelihood, my industry, and creatives everywhere. <br/><br/>The way these unchecked tech conglomerates would have it, is to feed their machines the proprietary work of creatives like myself and so many others, without their consent, to teach their programs how to regurgitate and imitate the work of humans. They want to steal our work so that they may churn it back out to us under the guise of invention and originality. But none of this is original. This is a parlor trick. A parlor trick that companies will exploit toward their own profits.<br/><br/>The Writers Guild of America is nearing five months of a strike that, amongst its many issues, surrounds AI concerns. These producing companies intend to punch out an AI generated script, inherently soulless by way of algorithms, claim ownership of this work that is entirely poached in content, then hire a human to make it into something real, whilst stripping that human of any real authorship of the work or payment that would be due to an original author. AI is theft.<br/><br/>SAG-AFTRA, the performers union, has been on strike for over two months, alongside the WGA, aligned in its fight against AI. These same producing companies intend to replicate actors&rsquo; likenesses, voices, and performances ad infinitum for the cost of a single day&rsquo;s work. They are already putting language into contracts giving themselves these rights to own a performer forever. Actors will lose their entire careers, as will the hair, makeup, costume, casting directors and even caterers that support these actors. AI is theft.<br/><br/>Please give this technology the regulation and governance that it requires. Just as we would not feel comfortable serving Dolly the cloned sheep to our families for dinner, we should not feel comfortable with replications hijacking our creative industries. AI is theft and exploitation and creatives deserve to have their works and likenesses protected from unchecked greed.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope we can govern this technology ethically and fairly for all who would profit from it. Thank you for reading my comment.
