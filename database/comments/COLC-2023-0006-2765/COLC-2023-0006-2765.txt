As someone who writes and would like to be a published author, AI-generated content is a big worry for me. I have heard of instances of these programs being trained on existing writers&#39; content and being used to create books. In my mind, any writing generated by AI should not be copywriteable, because it relies on the copying of other writers works to create. Writing and art both take a significant amount of skill and time to create; these skills should be protected. AI generation is not a skill. It&#39;s just a printer that takes from the works of other and assembles it into something resembling a piece of work. <br/>The copywrite system was created to protect the work of artists and inventors from being copied by competitors. AI generated content is a competitor to human generated artwork. I believe the government should make it illegal to train AI on copywritten works, and should not have the option of copywrite itself to protect artists.
