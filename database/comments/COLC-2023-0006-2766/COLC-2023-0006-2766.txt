AI generated content should absolutely not be copyrightable. Not only is it not human created, it is created by cutting together pieces of thousands of human&#39;s work, typically without their consent. As such it does not constitute an original work.<br/><br/>The companies making these AI products would have you believe the algorithm is learning from the inputs as a human does. However, this can be easily disproven by the fact that if you train an AI on other AI generated works, it gets worse and worse with each generation, until it collapses into nonsense. This is known as model collapse. Contrast this with a human, who can learn and improve on the works of other humans.
