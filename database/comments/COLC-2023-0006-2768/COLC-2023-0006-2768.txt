As an independent artist, my personal concern with AI copyright ability is that, since AI are often trained off of stolen art the works copyrighted would essentially be Frankenstein monster like versions of existing art that would be used to put the original creators at a disadvantage. AI, or if we can call it by its true name, machine learning, is by nature of its design incapable of producing any original ideas or work. I think treating it as if it can is ingenuine, and dishonest to real human artists. I also take issue with the supposed &quot;boon&quot; that gets touted--the idea that AI art is good because it allows for more art to be produced quicker and at a larger scale. This, I feel, is problematic because it stems from seeing art as a product whose end goal is to be consumed. Ask any artists and they will tell you that art is more than that, and validating this view would be damaging to our society. It is a tool, yes, as is any computer function, but we should be cautious about the ways it is used. Preventing AI works from being able to claim copyright is a regulation that should be put in place to maintain that caution.
