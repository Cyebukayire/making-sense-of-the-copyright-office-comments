I work in the entertainment industry as a television director. I am someone who loves technology and advances in the ways that we use tech, but the recent discussions around generative AI are concerning. I understand that streamers and big tech have already fed the &quot;machines&quot; all of our work and it samples some of it as part of information-gathering. Then AI will generate new material erasing our original work, without credit. This should not be permissible. The creators of content and art should be compensated and credit as part of the AI process. We need the government to make regulations that are enforceable and punishable. The studios and streamers asking to scan actors and only compensating those workers for only one day of work but being able to use their likeness in perpetuity is an extreme example but a common one, that should be stopped. Please look closely at what&#39;s already happening and what the studios and streamers are trying to push forward.
