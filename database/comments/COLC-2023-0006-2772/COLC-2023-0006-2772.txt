I was reading a wonderful opinion piece by Timothy B. Lee, &quot;The Copyright Office is making a mistake on AI-generated art&quot;, and I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with his premise. He made a comparison to cameras that I find quite illuminating. Particularly as the camera was a novel method for creating images in the late 19th century, we face a similar situation with AI confabulation today. When the US Supreme Court, in its ruling on BURROW-GILES LITHOGRAPHIC Co. v. SARONY. said the Wilde photograph reflected Sarony&rsquo;s &ldquo;original mental conception,&rdquo; which he had brought to life by &ldquo;posing Oscar Wilde in front of the camera, selecting and arranging the costume, draperies, and other various accessories in said photograph, arranging the subject so as to present graceful outlines, arranging and disposing the light and shade, suggesting and evoking the desired expression.&rdquo; it conceded that a camera is a tool of creation.<br/>I believe this to be the root of the matter: Is the work a fabrication in service to a &ldquo;mental conception&rdquo;, conjugated by a tool as a part of the artist&rsquo;s process? Or are you simply collecting gems found upon the beachhead of AI dreams?  Here is some insight into my process: I prepared an outline and know what each of the 25 chapters will be about.  The subject and important points of each conversation and passage of prose is outlined as the objective in the prompts I use. Often, the results I get from the model that runs on my own hardware (check out lmstudio.ai if you want to run local LLMs) must be further refined. It&rsquo;s as if I am Andy Warhol overseeing the &quot;art-workers&quot; of my own &ldquo;Factory&rdquo;. Though there is no comprehension by the agent, I must concede that outputs of a requested prompt could be &quot;work for hire&quot;, akin to a company contracting an artist. But, it is quite clear that in most cases works like mine are nowhere close to a &ldquo;merely mechanical&rdquo; process. I may be an employer of a &ldquo;robot monkey typewriter&rdquo;, but the intellectual property in this project is my own.
