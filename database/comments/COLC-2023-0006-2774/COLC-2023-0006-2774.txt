Nothing that generative software &quot;Creates&quot; should be able to be copywritten unless every single piece of data the software has been trained on was given written permission and compensated. A contract that an artist has to opt in and out on doesn&#39;t count. They need written permission and to be paid for it. Scraping someone&#39;s life work for a program to use is theft.
