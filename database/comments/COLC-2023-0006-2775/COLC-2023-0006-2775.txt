Creativity is a core tenant of humanity. Outsourcing this resource to technology not only discards the beauty of what it is to be a creator as a person, but it erodes the concept of inspiration striking and unique ideas. While in some positive cases, it eliminates the friction between idea and execution, at this rate, it&#39;s like eliminating the friction of gravity to make a footstep easier. Said friction is what makes forward movement possible and without it, progress literally floats away.<br/>Artificial intelligence an existential threat to any and all industries because if this isn&#39;t curbed immediately (as it may already be too late), it&#39;s only a matter of time before humans become obsolete. This burgeoning entity has already been given too much free rein. We missed the boat on stopping the menace of social media from negatively impacting the human condition and have just let it warp society irreparably. AI is this phenomenon on steroids. Do something before AI does it for you.
