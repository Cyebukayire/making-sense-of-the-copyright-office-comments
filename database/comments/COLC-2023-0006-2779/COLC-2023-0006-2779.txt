Artificial Intelligence should be regulated, but it does not need to be substantially regulated. It has experienced massive growth in the past few years and its potential to grow is even greater. However, with its fast growth there would be issues with copyright. Personally, I&#39;ve seen generative AI being abused over the past year, so it is only necessary that The United States Copyright Office has taken notice of this before issues that are arising, get out of hand. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>In &quot;II. The Copyright Office&#39;s Past Work on Machine Learning and AI&quot; of Artificial Intelligence and Copyright: <br/><br/>One such issue is the fact that people intend to copyright material which is AI-generated. The United States Copyright Office has dealt with this before and have said they will not allow material that is AI-generated to be registered. In one such case, someone attempted to copyright two-dimensional artwork that was autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine. The Office&#39;s Review board denied the registration because it lacked &quot;any creative input or intervention from a human author.&quot; They also stated that &ldquo;statutory text, judicial precedent, and longstanding Copyright Office practice&rdquo; all require human authorship as a condition of copyrightability.&quot; It wouldn&#39;t make sense that people that depended on an AI to produce something they lack expertise in, could copyright AI-generated outputs as those same people cannot produce the same results as an AI through their own human inputs. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>In &quot;IV. The Current Inquiry&quot; of Artificial Intelligence and Copyright: <br/><br/> Along with the copyrightability of AI-generated material, the Office is also interested in how the liability should be apportioned if copyright infringement did take place. This would happen if an AI-generated output is found to be substantially similar to copyrighted material that was part of a training dataset. Would liability go to the user who prompted the AI, the AI itself (technically no one), or the developers of the AI and the training dataset? According to the fair use doctrine, you are liable for copyright infringement even if you use that copyright material unknowingly and are not using the copyrighted material fairly. So, it would be both the user who prompted the AI and the developers who are liable for the infringement depending on if they had gained financial winnings through distributing the copyrighted material and if they did it without the copyright holder&rsquo;s permission. <br/><br/>Connected to this topic, is the issue of artists&rsquo;/performers&rsquo; likenesses and voices being used unfairly, due to AI&rsquo;s ability to mimic them. I have personally seen this be the case in YouTube videos where people use artists&rsquo; sampled voices to make new music without the artist ever being directly involved in the project. These concerns which are held today by artists could become reality for them and they could lose their rightful jobs, making the use of generative AI in this manner unfair competition. <br/><br/>However, this doesn&#39;t mean generative AI should be strictly regulated. As I have seen personally, people are having fun with the new Artificial Intelligence technology that is being innovated upon more as people become more interested in it. It is used in many markets such as architecture and finance through many datasets to train itself on; and as is proven in business in general, introduction of innovative technology increases productivity and efficiency.
