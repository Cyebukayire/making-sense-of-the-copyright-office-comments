AI should not be copyrightable and protected because the source of the original art is much too closely tied to other copyrighted work and that has not been at all dealt with to the level it needs to be.  <br/>To allow it to be so threatens the art community and their livelihoods to a level that is not reasonable and should not be legal.  <br/>Artists deserve to have their original work protected and AI has stolen already from those artists.  To protect the users of the software after what has already happened would be a tearing down of sorts, of an already fragile community of workers that already is often at many hardships around them that they have to deal with on a whim.  So I hope that AI will remain not copyrightable. <br/>Thank you.
