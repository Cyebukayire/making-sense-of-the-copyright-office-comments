Hello &ndash; my name is Avi Ballo, and I am a Writers&#39; Room Assistant in Los Angeles, CA, and a concerned citizen writing to urge you to regulate generative &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; so that it cannot be copyrighted as original work, in order to preserve the American ideals of humanism and personal property. Laws should be designed to protect people, not new forms of machine learning, and current forms of generative AI do nothing more than steal the work of humans en masse and regurgitate it in altered form, disenfranchising both the author(s) and the user(s).<br/><br/>Thank you for considering public comment on this matter.
