Hello. I&#39;m an artist, I have a BFA in graphic design, though I mostly draw cartoons and illustrations these days. This past year and a half has been pretty bleak on my end due in part to the damage that AI generation has done to the arts. Commissions are nearly impossible to get, people are being laid off and replaced with robots that scanned their work and regurgitated it in part without permission or compensation. My future in art has in large part pulled up above me like a ladder I will never grab hold of again unless the government steps in and puts it back and nails it down.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t think that certain companies that trained their models under the guise of non profit research should be able to turn around and start making a profit off of what they&#39;ve turned into ill gotten gains through their about face. They&#39;re hoping they won&#39;t get caught, but they must be.<br/><br/>Any AI generator that must exist should only exist as trained on legally and consensually obtained materials. I shouldn&#39;t have to be afraid that if I put something online someone could steal it and then have no recourse in reasserting my rights. I don&#39;t want my data scraped and tangled in a learning model. Period. I shouldn&#39;t have to mask my artwork or cover it with a billion multicolor transparent watermarks to maybe make it safe enough to show it to my followers. Human thieves will be with us always and there&#39;s law protecting us from that, but there&#39;s seemingly very little to protect us from the training. I don&#39;t want compensation forced on me, I want my data removed immediately when infringed on. My data is not simply being curated, but used and disseminated for profit at my and everyone else&#39;s expense. <br/><br/>These models must be open and opt in only, (unless in the creative commons of course). These companies need regulation and harsh scrutiny. The future remains bleak and burdensome upon the arts unless and until AI generation companies are brought in compliance with common sense decency. Do not steal. Duh.
