I am an amateur author who has had my works used to train AI writing models, both with and without my permission. I am not a legal expert, and have only a general understanding of the AI writing models this comment describes. I am providing anecdotes as well as opinions in response to some General Questions in this Request, specified below.<br/><br/>The AI system trained with my permission was a small-scale Twitter (now X) bot which generated plausible posts that could fit into a Twitter-based original story I authored alongside between 5 and 10 other authors between the years of 2015 and 2020. The bot was made by one of my co-authors, and was made by training a GPT-2 model on our collective writing. Aside from GPT-2&#39;s pretraining, this GPT-2 model was not trained on any writing outside of our own work, and the individual who trained the GPT-2 model had explicit permission from all of the authors of the project. No one profited from this Twitter bot; I don&#39;t know if OpenAI profited from my friend using GPT-2 or not, because I don&#39;t know 100% what the user-end of that looked like, but they didn&#39;t directly profit from my work.<br/><br/>The AI trained without my permission was a large-scale writing AI. This anecdote is relevant to General Question 7.4. The AI in question was Sudowrites, and it trained a GPT-3 model by scraping the fanfiction website Archive Of Our Own (abbreviated from here as AO3). Users of AO3 had noticed what they suspected to be bot activity in the form of anonymous &quot;kudos&quot; (likes) which spammed fanfiction uploaders&#39; pages. These anonymous kudos would often spam hundreds of fanfictions spanning entire fandoms over time periods spreading hours or days. This indicated some sort of scraping bot, but users assumed it was for another archival website, such as the Internet Archive, and paid it no mind. After a few years of this, news came out that Sudowrites was using fanfiction assets to generate writing - noted by its extensive knowledge of very specific themes that occur widely, but almost exclusively, in fanfiction. As a fanfiction author who uploads to AO3, this means my works were likely scraped and used as training data for Sudowrites; God only knows who else has my writing somewhere in their training data.<br/><br/>In response to  General Question 15, I believe that developers of AI models, systems, and datasets should be required to collect and retain a record of what their models and systems are trained on, and what is in their AI datasets. Even if the law decides that they are not obligated to ask anyone for consent to include their works in these models, systems, and datasets, they should be obligated to inform authors or web-hosters that their work has been scraped<br/><br/>In response to General Question 10.1, direct voluntary lisencing should be considered part of the expense (in money, time, and effort) to creating an AI model, system, or dataset that the creators of the AI or AI dataset expect to profit from. (This does not concern amateur AI work, since that distinction is also drawn for writing, drawing, and other forms of art.) If it would be &quot;unfeasible&quot; to obtain direct voluntary lisencing for all training data for an AI which *anyone* will draw profit from, the project scope should be narrowed. The law should not coddle people who steal others&#39; works because they think it would be too difficult to ask permission first.<br/><br/>In response to General Question 27, I would like to point out that fanfiction authors are well aware that they cannot claim copyright over any of their works, as they are expanding upon IP that&#39;s often owned by another entity. Fanfiction authors create fanworks with the understanding that we may not profit from, or claim copyright of, any of our fanworks. It directly violates AO3&#39;s terms of service to post advertisements or attempt to profit from the platform. If an AI system is trained on fanfiction which is written without a personal copyright, it still has the capability to regurgitate information which contains another entity&#39;s IP. So if the owners and operators of AI systems - or the &quot;authors&quot; of AI-generated works - were granted the ability to claim AI-generated works regardless of origin, they would gain the ability to claim these &quot;fandom&quot; IPs as their own IP, which gives them a financial advantage over human fanwork creators. Even distinctions in dataset origin might exclude, say, Harry Potter from a legal text dataset, but include fanfiction of Harry Potter uploaded to AO3. This gray area would also give AI fanfiction creators the right to claim AI-generated fanfiction as their own, which would give them an advantage over human fanfiction authors.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
