While most of what this discussion concerns us with is around art (painting and drawing), it&#39;s important we discuss other areas that maybe impacted by generative AI.<br/><br/>ISSUE 1: &quot;As to the first issue, the Office is aware that there is disagreement about whether or when the use of copyrighted works to develop datasets for training AI models (in both generative and non-generative systems) is infringing.&quot;<br/><br/>I DO NOT believe that merely &quot;training off&quot; generative material should be considered automatically an infringement.<br/>However, that does not mean that there aren&#39;t problems in generative systems. There are some problems with code being generated by generative AI that is verbatim, or overly similar/identical to material it trained off of.  While I strongly believe AI generated code -- even if &quot;trained&quot; off public copyrighted material should be considered fair use when the generated code is sufficiently different, IE transformative, the same cannot be said of code which is overly similar.  Fair Use is a cornerstone of innovation. It permits the use of copyrighted material, as long as it&#39;s use in a work is sufficiently different. <br/><br/>Instead, I believe congress should adapt common sense policies which would require GPT 3.5/4 and Copilot to adapt filters and safeguards that will prevent code from being generated that is overly similar to any source material, if said source material is of a proprietary source.  And if it does generate code that is too similar to a MIT/Apache source, than the code generator should be required to provide a disclaimer as well.  Copilot appears to be implementing this to a degree, unfortunately, it is not mandatory. https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom <br/><br/>ISSUE 2) &quot;On the second issue, the Office seeks comment on the proper scope of copyright protection for material created using generative AI. Although we believe the law is clear that copyright protection in the United States is limited to works of human authorship, (35) questions remain about where and how to draw the line between human creation and AI-generated content. For example, are there circumstances where a human&#39;s use of a generative AI system could involve sufficient control over the technology, such as through the selection of training materials and multiple iterations of instructions (&ldquo;prompts&rdquo;), to result in output that is human-authored?&quot;<br/><br/>Generative AI not covered by copyright represents a once in a lifetime opportunity to expand the body of Public Domain. Generative works not considered an infringement on any &quot;source material&quot;, and in which the human did not manually modify any material portion of the generated code should be placed directly in the public domain.  In so far as generative artwork is concerned, this also represents a major opportunity to expand the Public Domain vastly.<br/><br/>ISSUE 3) On the third question, the Office is interested in how copyright liability principles could apply to material created by generative AI systems. (37) For example, if an output is found to be substantially similar to a copyrighted work that was part of the training dataset, and the use does not qualify as fair, how should liability be apportioned between the user whose instructions prompted the output and developers of the system and dataset?<br/><br/>The one who should be liable should be the owners of the generative AI systems if they have not taken appropriate action to develop and deploy safeguards to prevent verbatim or overly similar code from being generated. If the user deliberately exploits a bug within the generative AI to produce copyrighted or otherwise infringing code, than the user shall be liable.
