Subject: Unique Copyright Challenge in the Age of Artificial Intelligence<br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern,<br/><br/>I write to bring to the attention of the United States Government a distinctive copyright challenge that has emerged in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). The U.S. Copyright Office recently extended the deadline for public comments regarding AI and copyright, recognizing the need for comprehensive input to address this novel situation.<br/><br/>The challenge arises from the fusion of human creativity and AI-generated content. In this unique scenario, I, as a music creator, combine my own vocal performances with AI-generated tracks to produce entirely original compositions. These compositions are the result of a creative partnership between human and machine.<br/><br/>Key points to consider:<br/><br/>Ownership and Originality: My music compositions are unique creations where my vocals are a substantial component. I own the masters for these compositions and can provide documentation to support this claim.<br/><br/>AI Artist Attribution: I use the notation &quot;Ft. Artist Name AI&quot; in art covers to transparently convey the involvement of AI-generated elements in my music. These AI models are entirely artificial and do not incorporate proprietary recordings or voice samples of public figures.<br/><br/>Realistic Permissions: Seeking permissions from deceased artists, as mentioned in a previous discussion, is both impractical and legally challenging. The deceased individuals cannot provide consent.<br/><br/>Two-Step Release Process: To address legal complexities and provide transparency, I am considering a two-step release process that includes both the original tracks and the dual/vocal tracks, showcasing the fusion of human and AI elements.<br/><br/>Unique Artistic Expression: This approach offers a unique artistic expression that may not be widely recognized yet. It also provides clarity regarding the ownership of masters.<br/><br/>Burden of Proof: I understand the necessity of demonstrating ownership and legitimacy, and I am fully prepared to do so.<br/><br/>In light of this situation, I respectfully request that the U.S. Copyright Office and the United States Government consider the unique challenges and opportunities presented by this fusion of human and AI creativity. The extension of the comment deadline is appreciated, as it allows for a more comprehensive examination of this evolving landscape.<br/><br/>I am committed to upholding the highest standards of creativity and legality in my music endeavors, and your understanding and support in addressing this unique copyright challenge are invaluable.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>United States Citizen
