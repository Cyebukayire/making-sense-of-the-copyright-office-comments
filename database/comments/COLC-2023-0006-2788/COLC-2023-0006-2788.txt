Do not be fooled by the fact the tech industry has decided to call this AI. It&#39;s just the predictive text systems from your cellphone scaled up with Big Data and sometimes applied to different mediums. AI is just a marketing term being applied to this stuff to make it seem more advanced and sci-fi than it is.<br/>1) Using copyrighted works in AI training sets without explicit permission is a clear violation of copyright. AI systems cannot differentiate which works from the training set were used in the production of which outputs. Therefore, if an AI system has in its training set an copyrighted work without the permission of the copyright holder, all outputs of the AI system must be treated as having used that copyrighted work.<br/>2) AI is not human. Therefore, its outputs must be not copyrightable. Some will argue that sufficiently-detailed prompts provided to AI would count as the spark of inspiration. However, clearly there is a big difference in the amount of creativity between a prompt given to AI and a completed work.<br/>3) Clearly, any operator if an AI system that is using copyrighted data in its training set would be liable for copyright infringement for every item that AI system generates. I believe that it is in the best interests of everyone involved to have the rule be such that any user of an output from such an AI system is also liable. This is to ensure there is no incentive to just pretend you didn&#39;t know a work was AI-generated on copyrighted material to try to side-step your complicity in the AI system&#39;s owners copyright infringement.<br/>4) Without having a decently large sample size of that creator&#39;s work in the training set of the AI, there really isn&#39;t a way for an AI system to what that creator&#39;s style is to be able to base any output on. So if using copyrighted works without permission is a violation as I suggest in point #1, this stops being an issue. If using a copyrighted work in the training set is allowed, then I don&#39;t see a way this can be addressed at all.
