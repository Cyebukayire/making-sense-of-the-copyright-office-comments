As a writer, I am deeply concerned that nothing is being done to protect my creativity. My work has already been scraped by Common Crawl and used in data sets without my consent. The work of my artist peers has been stolen and used in the same way. No one should be allowed to steal our work to bypass the years of training required to hone our craft. No one should be allowed to profit off of our work by using it as training data in their paid products. Please do not let the exploitative AI companies and their cryptocurrency worshipping customers destroy our livelihoods like this! Please protect human creatives!
