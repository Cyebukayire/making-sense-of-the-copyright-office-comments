I feel that a compensation system is highly desirable when AI systems are trained on the works of human authors, and that AI-generated work should have a clearly identifiable and auditable data trail showing exactly which works were used.  At no time should an AI-generated work be permitted copyright protection unless the authors of all &quot;parent&quot; works are added to the copyright.  In addition, the original authors should have the right to refuse the use of their work in a derivative, and compensated with a licensing fee at the time of copyright registration if they do permit the AI creator to use their work.
