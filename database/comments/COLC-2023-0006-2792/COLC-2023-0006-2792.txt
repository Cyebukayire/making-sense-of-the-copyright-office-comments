To summarize, I strongly believe that any AI generated content should not be able to be copyrighted, as it is not created by a human and in nearly every case is comprised of content stolen from actual human creators. Please protect work created by actual humans.<br/><br/>I have personally seen the stress and financial struggles already beginning to affect those in more creative pursuits in my life as this cheap, stolen, AI content is used to push actual humans out of their own job markets, leaving them out of work or struggling to keep their heads above water.<br/><br/>9: I believe that affirmative consent (opt in) is the only way to appropriately engage with AI model training, an opt-in that can be revoked at any time would be a far better way to protect actual human creators. <br/><br/>9.1: I also believe that concept of the copyright owner should be required for all uses of copyrighted words to train AI models.<br/><br/>9.2: A technical flag or database of &#39;off limits&#39; creators could be one way to approach an opt out system. However in my opinion this would be clunky and still leave it far too easily for works to still be used in AI training against consent. This is another reason why an opt in system is a far simpler and safer option.<br/><br/>9.4: If an objection is not honored I believe that the creator infringed upon should be awarded damages based on the revenue and impressions generated by the AI work featuring stolen content in addition to a steep fine.<br/><br/>10: I believe that a consent form that can be notarized and kept on file would work.<br/><br/>15: Yes, I do believe that developers of AI models should be required to collect, retain, and disclose records regarding material used to train their models, with the same restrictions for creators of training datasets. The content is not theirs and this would also make it a little easier to track down material used without consent.<br/><br/>15.1: The artist name at a minimum should be noted.<br/><br/>16: Unless there is record of the copyright owner explicitly consenting to have their works used, I believe there should be notification in each case where material is used to train AI.<br/><br/>18: No. I do not believe there are any circumstances wherein a human using an AI system can be considered an author of the produced material. They did not create the materials the system is trained on, and did not even personally craft the produced material. It is not their work.<br/><br/>19: With the developments in recent technology I do believe it would be not only a good idea but a necessary one to revise the Copyright act to clarify human authorship as a requirement for copyright protection.<br/><br/>20: I do not believe legal protection for AI-generated material is desirable. I believe it would be an insult to the work produced by actual humans.<br/><br/>25: If AI-generated material is found to infringe upon a copyrighted work I believe that everyone involved should be secondarily liable at a minimum, with the original developer or other party who initially caused the infringement directly liable.<br/><br/>28: Yes, any content that includes AI-generated material should be labeled so in a public and visible manner, similar to the law in France in effect October 2017 requiring a label on digitally altered photos of models.<br/><br/>28.1: This identification should be labeled via the one creating the work.<br/><br/>32: There should absolutely be protections against an AI system generating imitations of a human creator&#39;s style. I believe that this is just as if not even more of an egregious insult to actual human creators and their work.
