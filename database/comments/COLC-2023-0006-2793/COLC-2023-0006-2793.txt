Copyrighted artwork should not be allowed to be used to train AI, nor should it be allowed to be used in generate any AI &quot;artworks&quot;, unless the original artist is compensated and gives their express permission. Allowing every random AI program to train off of other people&#39;s life&#39;s work is allowing those AI program creators to profit and prosper without paying credit to the people whose work makes those programs possible. Other businesses and programs are not allowed to use copyrighted works without permission/compensation, AI programs should be no different.
