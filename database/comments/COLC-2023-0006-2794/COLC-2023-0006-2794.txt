By giving copyright ownership to AI, any future human creator would be unable to own a copyright and receive any benefit generated from a copyright notice. If creators are told that their work can&#39;t be copyrighted due to the fact that AI has created a work too similar to distribute a copyright for their work, they are immediately going to be disincentivized to create anything in the future. The lack of protection equals lack of creativity, which will quickly disintegrate many parts of our society. The fact that AI has the ability to produce material from other people&#39;s work means that it is not a unique creation that can be copyrighted.  The definition of creativity is &quot;the use of the imagination or original ideas, especially in the production of an artistic work.&quot; Not a single piece of could be generated from AI without access to others works. That alone means that it does not have the capacity to create anything original. If you want to deter human innovation and creativity, then go ahead and protect AI generated works.
