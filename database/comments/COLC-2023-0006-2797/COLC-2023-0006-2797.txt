I just want to say that AI might be the most exciting technology I&#39;ve seen develop over my lifetime. Having seen the online discourse I&#39;ve been incredibly disheartened by the discourse, the lack of nuance and lashing out has me incredibly scared that the US regulators will have a knee jerk reaction that will kill the technology in its cradle and have incredibly damaging long-term consequences for the country and the people it is trying to &quot;defend&quot; by shipping all their jobs to places where the tech is allowed to be used.<br/><br/>Please have nuanced conversations about this and don&#39;t jump the gun here. Consider the 2nd and 3rd order effects of early regulatory capture.
