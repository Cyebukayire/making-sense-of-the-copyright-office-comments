AI generated works should not be eligible for copyright as there is really little to no skill or actual work behind the generated &ldquo;works&rdquo;. Add to that as of late a few actual artist have started lawsuits for infringement it would be come across as counterintuitive for the copyright office to now issue copyright for works where no actual work has been done. Another issue would be the lack of transparency when the generators were created no one actually gave their permission for their works to be used to train AI as a result a lot of skilled artist were and still are rather upset with the lack of guardrails set in place and the continued infringement of their works being scraped. In conclusion, no, the U.S. copyright office should forbid AI works from gaining copyright.
