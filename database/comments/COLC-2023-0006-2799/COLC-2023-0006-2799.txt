The fact it&#39;s called Artificial Intelligence is itself misleading. Intelligence has no bearing on what AI does, it takes a prompt and rips data from various sources - regardless of creator consent - so it can churn out something that resembles what it was fed. At no point does thought enter the equation, it&#39;s all just ethically dubious scraped information masquerading as art.
