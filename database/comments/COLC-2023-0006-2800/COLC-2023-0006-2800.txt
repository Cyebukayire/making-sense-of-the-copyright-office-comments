In regards to the issue of using copyright materials for training, the mathematical manipulation that most large language models and Image creator AI models use should be considered transformative, as the main information taken from the original work is not its function, nature, or artistic value, but the probability of the single elements that are present in the work and comparing it to multiple other works. The original purpose of copyright is not as a blanket over whatever was produced, but to protect what made the work unique. Based this argument on the definition of LLMs obtained from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zizonToFXDs<br/>As the information used for training doesn&#39;t need anything else from the model, there shouldn&#39;t be any need for citation when using copyright material, except if while using the LLM model, the &quot;answer&quot; to the query does require direct citation of the copyrighted material. For example, the training that let the LLM write sonnets probably used Shakespeare (or a modern author) to get the rules, but doesn&#39;t use the material for it, therefore no citation needed. If I use the LLM to analyze the work of the modern author and the validity of their sonnets, and the LLM uses examples to discuss it, then it should be clearly cited. The reason for this distinction, is that if it is not included, multiple open LLMs that are not dependent on outside funding, would probably not have the capacity to be developed if it was mandatory to cite any copyrighted media used for training in any particular query. <br/>In regards to the legal status of the AI produced content, it should be able to be copyrightable for the individual ,group or corporation that produced it, the same way that a camera that takes random photos of the street and whose pictures are used later for a museum exhibition would default the copyright of the pictures to the owner of the camera. <br/><br/>
