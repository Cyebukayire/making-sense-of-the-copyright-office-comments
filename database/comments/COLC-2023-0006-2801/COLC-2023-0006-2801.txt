Good afternoon. I do not consider it ethical to use intellectual property, even if it was posted on the Internet, to train artificial intelligence. For example, many people generate and SELL the characters they create. Art AI indirectly consists of strangers; how can something that violates these same rights be sold and protected by rights? The buyer simply cannot protect his image/character, since it is not anyone&#39;s property in principle. Anyone can assign the generated character to themselves. I don&#39;t want to be disappointed when someone passes off AI creation as creativity. I don&#39;t want my texts and drawings used to teach AI! Especially when I know about these terrible sales.<br/><br/>I am not an opponent of progress, and if the development of these systems is important to someone, then let them hire a special staff: artists, writers, etc., for their own purposes. They should not parasitize on other people&#39;s property.
