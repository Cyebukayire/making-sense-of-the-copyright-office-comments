I may not really be a content creator, or someone who creates AI-generated works, but I&#39;ve heard about the discussion regarding AI generated works, and I&#39;ve seen the different opinions of people online, either being against or in favor of AI-generated works, and I thought I should give my opinion regarding this topic of AI works and copyright.<br/><br/>Now, while it is true that AI generated works require some level of input from human beings, most of this input is required to set up the AI algorithm, while the works themselves are the products of the algorithm itself, therefore, AI-generated works are not made by a human being, but rather by an algorithm made by human beings, and thus, should not meet the legal requirements for copyright protection. The principles of copyright are based around the idea that human creators and that their original creations deserve protection, and that their creativity should be rewarded! If AI-generated works were to become copyrightable, this principles would be dimished, and it could open up the chances to many abuses, such as a masssive amount of AI-generated works being created without any human intervention.<br/><br/>As I seee it, making AI-generated works copyrightable would affect the human creators of all kinds, either artists, musician, authors, you name it. The valuable work and effort they put into their creations could be undermined the works created by AI, which aren&#39;t even truly made by human beings, as AI-generated works are made by an algorithm after all. So no, I don&#39;t believe that AI-generated works should be copyrighted
