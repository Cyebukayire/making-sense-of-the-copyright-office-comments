1. Potential benefits: might help speed up some process of creative work, but should only be applied is part of the process not entire replace human creators<br/>    Potential risk: Impact on environment as it require lots of resource and emit lots of CO2<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Impact on economy due to lost of job by unfair competition <br/><br/>Recently AI technology has been used to: <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- Plagiarize works of creator <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- Leak of private data<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- Using AI out put to scam people: scam phone call using image and voice of family members, friends to trick people<br/>sent scammers money,...; creat fake news; sell AI out put diguise as works creat by themself<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- Sexual harassment: AI undress apps and deepfake has been used to generate nude photos of real people<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- Many creators lost their jobs because their client start to use AI that has been trained on their work<br/><br/>2. In the art industry, the increasing use of AI has cause many to lost their jobs and their commission. People even put artist&#39;s work to AI feature such as img2img to directly plagiarize their work. People selling AI image but pretend that it were their work, some people bought AI product without knowing so could be considered scamming. Some use works and name of deceased artist such as Kim Jung Gi, Quinni,.. to generate and distribute images in their style and name despite the objection from their family, which disrecpect the deceased. There are models such as lora, civitai fine-tuning AI models with specific artist works and name to mimic their style without artist consent, which I believe is identity theft and counterfeiting. <br/>   Entry level artist having hard time finding jobs, which could negatively affecting the future of the art industry<br/>   There already lots of tool to help artist creat faster so I&#39;m not sure AI image generator actually help anything, they can not be use effectively without manually editing the image because of many mistake it has, and can not be used as refenrence neither because of the same reason.<br/><br/>3. These below are links that I believe has great analysis the impact of generated AI<br/>   https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3600211.3604681<br/>   https://fortune.com/2023/09/09/ai-chatgpt-usage-fuels-spike-in-microsoft-water-consumption/?utm_source=flipboard&amp;utm_content=user%2Ffortune<br/><br/>9. Copyright owners have to affirmatively consent (opt in) to the use of their works for training materials.<br/><br/>9.1 Consent of the copyright owner should be required for all uses of copyrighted works to train AI models.<br/><br/>9.5 In cases where the human creator does not own the copyright, they still should have a right to object to an AI model being trained on their work. The creator of copyright work should be informed and be able to make a deal if the hirer want to use their work to train AI, the pricing for training AI should be difference and should have a contract to train their work<br/> <br/>10 If copyright owners&#39;s consent is required to train generative AI models, liscense can be obtained through contract <br/><br/>15 Developers of AI models should be required to collect, retain, and disclose records regarding the materials used to train their models.<br/>Creators of training datasets should have a similar obligation. And creators of training data set have to prove that the data for training AI truly belonged or creates by them, incase someone that not creat the work try to profit from pirated content.<br/><br/>28. The law should require AI-generated material to be labeled or otherwise publicly identified as being generated by AI. All AI generated work created should have an unremovable watermark to identify as being generated by AI regardless of context<br/><br/>
