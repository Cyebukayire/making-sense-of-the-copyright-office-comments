As an independent researcher working at companies and Universities, I strongly believe that increasing the strength of copyright on public data will only benefit companies, such as Open AI, which are closed source and uses the same data without disclosing, or competing countries, such as China, which do not need to abide by US laws. I do agree that copyright is extremely important however I do believe we should invest more in research to figure out whether copyrighted material is used in models and removing it, such as what MIT is doing. The worst possible case scenario for the AI landscape will be to kill off open source or have open source under the umbrella of big tech&#39;s watchful eye to remove competition. Thanks for your consideration and for opening this forum
