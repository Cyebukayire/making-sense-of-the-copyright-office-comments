The only valid claims to copyright on AI are those of the artists who&#39;s work it is derived from.  To mass steal other people&#39;s work on the internet and then try to claim it as one&#39;s own is a theft, pure and simple. AI has no business being used for any commercial purpose unless it&#39;s databank is built solely on works from people who gave informed consent and were compensated with money. Opt out terms and conditions being snuck in place and only discovered by people after the fact is NOT informed consent. The AI that currently exists cannot be separated from anything that was cultivated legally vs what was not. So AI cannot ethically be used in commercial undertakings until those data banks are rebuilt completely from scratch using Opt IN and PAID methods. Anything else is theft.
