Generative AI models without regulatory oversight are harmful to the creative community. These models are trained on proprietary data, often without asking for permission or even acknowledging the creators of the source material. These companies scrape the web to steal training data from people who might not agree to their work being used this way. Let&rsquo;s say a writer wrote a poem about friendship. This poem was stolen off the internet and fed into a training data set for an AI poem generator. When you ask the AI for a poem about friendship, it will more than likely &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; (if not copy word-for-word) phrases or verses from the original poem it was trained on.<br/>Another major concern is that pictures of people&rsquo;s faces and bodies are also scraped off the web without permission and used to train AI models. There are already existing websites where users can generate pornography featuring any of their favorite celebrities, or even people they know, meanwhile none of those people consented to their likeness being used in such a way. <br/>In my opinion these companies need regulatory scrutiny immediately, and you should consult not only tech experts but artists and creators as well. <br/>My one suggestion is that all training data for AI models needs to be obtained with permission from the owner of the original source. Web scraping for training data should be prohibited.
