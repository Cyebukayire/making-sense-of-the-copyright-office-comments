As it stands now, AI works are little more than mindless plagiarism. They take copyrighted artwork by artists who very often did not consent to their work being used for such a purpose, churn it up in a mixing bowl, and spit out lackluster amalgams of those artists&#39; work. It&#39;s no better than someone stealing and then cutting up original paintings or drawings, gluing bits of them together, and calling it a brand new completely original copyrightable piece, except with less effort. There is no human input to be had, on top of the blatant plagiarism. It is a piece of programing spitting out the blandest common denominator of a mishmash of stolen work.<br/><br/>AI works should not be copyrightable, and should not be considered art. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s theft from artists who work hard all their lives to produce incredible pieces, and those artists are currently suffering massive hardship in the face of their employers using AI instead of real artwork for their products.
