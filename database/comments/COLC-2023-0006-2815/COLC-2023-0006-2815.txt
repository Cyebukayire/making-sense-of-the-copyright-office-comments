Using AI to scrape or use my work (art or writing) without permission when the end result may not actually be derivative or have significant differences from my own was bad enough, but being able to copy write and sell this work is unforgivable. There is not any unique idea or contribution posed by AI. This AI isn&#39;t even really AI - it is just content scraping and pattern recognition. There is nothing unique it can create and it cannot create something without thievery. The rampant use of this technology to cheat and to generate images based on the work of others (including data sets that users did not agree to make available for AI use) is already bad enough and not something I think should be legal either. I don&#39;t know what there is to copy write. This whole thing is basically using a machine to copy the homework of the kid next to you but write you own name on top of the paper.
