AI should be sued for copyright infringement. It steals other people&rsquo;s works and tries to pass it off as it&rsquo;s own. <br/>It does not learn, it simple copy pastes. Anything created with AI has not been given permission to do so in multiple ways. It has infringed upon artist, writers, actors, anything that involves some sort of creativity.
