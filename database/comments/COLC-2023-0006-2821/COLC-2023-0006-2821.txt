I absolutely do not support copyright for AI. The sole intent of copyright was to protect human endeavors and the families that supports. Coming from personal experience, it is already abhoringly difficult to earn a living doing creative fields. To grant this to an entity without human creativity is cruel to the artists of the world. There is also the entire ethical can of worms of how these AI were trained in the first place. They would not exist without having harvested human creativity in the first place.
