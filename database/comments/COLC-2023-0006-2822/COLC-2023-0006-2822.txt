People should not be able to copyright AI &ldquo;art&rdquo;; it is created and trained through stolen media and the overall impact is that it denies talented people opportunities to succeed in an already cutthroat industry. AI art is not something someone should be able to pretend they have worked hard to create. Ensuring that entities cannot copyright AI art prevents larger entities from bullying smaller ones and creates more jobs/opportunities to succeed. We shouldn&rsquo;t allow for the commercialization of stolen copyrighted content.
