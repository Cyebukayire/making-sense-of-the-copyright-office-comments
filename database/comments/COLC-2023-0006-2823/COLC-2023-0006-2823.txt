I am a working writer. My words are my intellectual property and my brand. For AI to use them to train itself would be to train itself to steal my work and impersonate me. This would be acceptable in no other context. Please set boundaries for what AI can consume so that it must ask permission and it must pay a fee set by the writer not the platform or distributor. These words are our livelihood. AI has no more right to steal them than a person does. This is the point of copywriting.
