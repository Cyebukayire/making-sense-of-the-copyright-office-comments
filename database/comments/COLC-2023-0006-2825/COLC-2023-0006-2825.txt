As a rule, AI- generated artwork cannot ever generate original work. It can only ever give us iterations of existing work, which means the work will never be wholly original except perhaps in the arrangement of elements of the artwork or script that are created.<br/><br/>AI does not have imagination as humans do. It cannot dream up things like irrigation, motor vehicles, or the concept of democracy. Not without first having been shown those ideas, because it does not think like we do or have the capacity to observe and test an idea that would then lead towards invention or innovation.<br/><br/>AI thinks only in terms of achieving its stated objective, without regard for unintended consequences along the way.<br/><br/>As such, AI systems should never be granted copyright for the objects they produce, and the writing and images and other creations from AI systems - again, mere iterations of already existing real world creations from humans - should never be thought of as anything more than fanfiction or artwork created by fans. It is incapable of being original.
