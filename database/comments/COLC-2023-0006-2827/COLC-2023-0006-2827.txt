There is a constant reference to, &quot;training&quot; AI on established works, when in reality it is only learning to plagiarize them. Just as teachers have long pointed out that changing a few words of a sentence doesn&#39;t make the work your own, the same holds true for AI generated work. It isn&#39;t creating, it&#39;s copying and claiming to be a new original work. This, in and of itself, is a violation of legal and moral standards.<br/><br/>We no longer appreciate the true creative capabilities of humans because computers (AI and CGI as examples) have replaced other traditional trades and crafts. In some ways, this has been beneficial. It creates safer work environments and diminishes risk in some cases. But it as also desensitized us to what the human mind can create and accomplish. That needs to be protected. Allowing AI to copy the works of others is stealing from the original artists creativity and financial compensation. Art in it&#39;s many forms are meant to be appreciated, not stolen.
