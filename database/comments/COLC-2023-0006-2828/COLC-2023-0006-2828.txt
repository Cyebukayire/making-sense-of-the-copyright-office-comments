If the governments of the world do not take a stand soon, countless people will be out of a job. Generative A.I. could irreparably destroy our economy. These technologies also threaten to stagnate our culture and create a future of bland, over-processed entertainment. America&#39;s cultural capital is one of its greatest assets on the global stage and one of humanity&#39;s greatest attributes is the creativity that drives us to make art. The most valuable thing we leave behind is our art, literature, and music which express the human condition. <br/><br/>I don&#39;t think anything made using generative A.I. deserves the protection of copyright. Generative A.I. in it&#39;s current forms (which use large datasets comprised of content stolen from broad swaths of the internet without permission) is nothing but a colossal plagiarism device. My artwork and the artwork of millions of other human creators have already been stolen by the architects of these datasets. However, If a company like Disney uses their own generative A.I. that only draws from a dataset of content that they own outright, I believe they have a better argument of ownership and legal protection BUT I still don&#39;t like it. There are more than enough talented and willing artists they could hire to produce the same work. <br/><br/>I also believe that copyright holders whose works have already been stolen and put into these datasets are owed compensation and the perpetrators of this data collection should be punished as fully as the law allows. Safeguards need to be put up to make it illegal to steal works to train A.I. <br/><br/>I think the U.S. government should pass a law requiring all machine-generated art to be labeled something like &quot;Made by Machine&quot; or &quot;Created by A.I.&quot; and list the platform it was created on. Requiring some sort of metadata to be embedded in images, text, video, audio, etc. created by A.I. would also be a good idea. <br/><br/>Companies and projects that utilize generative A.I. in their creation should be ineligible for tax breaks and government funds on all levels. Our government needs to protect human citizens, not garbage replication algorithms. <br/><br/>The U.S. should also establish serious legal penalties for trying to pass A.I. or machine-generated art off as human. <br/><br/>Now is the time to dam the flood of generative garbage that is being spewed into the internet and the world by these systems. A.I. generated content is phony, baseless, and worthless and the more of it that exists, the murkier the internet becomes. These garbage images and text are being produced at a higher rate every day that goes by - please do something to stop it.
