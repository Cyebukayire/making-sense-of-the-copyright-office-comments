AI-generated art and writing is a huge threat to my career. I am an artist and many of my friends are writers and it is very upsetting to see AI-generated content being used more and more frequently in place of work made by human creators. In addition to this, AI-generated content pulls from the work of non-consenting artists for its source material. There needs to be regulations put in place to stop this and to ensure the jobs of artists remain safe and viable.
