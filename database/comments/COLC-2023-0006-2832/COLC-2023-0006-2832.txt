I think that A.I. technologies should be heavily regulated. These technological capacities make copyright infringement not only easy, but with high probability on enormous scale. Because artificial intelligence already draws on real HUMAN  work, writings, audio, etc. it is merely pattern making and pattern matching predictive behaviors generated by real artists. I believe AI should be left largely out of the creative fields and used lightly if creatives or creative companies deem it helpful and necessary.
