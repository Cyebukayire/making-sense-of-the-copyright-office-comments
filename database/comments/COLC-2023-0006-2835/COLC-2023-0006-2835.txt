Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment.<br/><br/>I am a supporter of authors and artists, and recognize that it is important in a democratic society to support the creation of art.<br/><br/>Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering these comments.
