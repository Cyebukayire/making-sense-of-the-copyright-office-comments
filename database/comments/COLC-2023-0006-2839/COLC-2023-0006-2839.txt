Hello! I am an American high school senior (note: I am studying in Thailand at the moment, so if my location states that I am there, that is why) who has dreams of working in creative industries, such as television, film, and books. I have had this dream since I was a young child. However, the rise of generative AI has made me second-guess my dream, and honestly sent me into a depression.<br/><br/>Generative AI is not really intelligent; it takes billions of images and documents from across the internet (nearly all without the original creator&rsquo;s/author&rsquo;s consent) and makes something in the blink of an eye. These machines, which would not exist without the hard work of creatives everywhere (but especially AMERICAN creatives!) - and, even worse, it threatens to replace them. Don&rsquo;t you see how messed up this is? The ONLY protection creatives have against being replaced with machines that have taken their work without their consent is the fact that generated images cannot be copyrighted. Please, please, PLEASE - you cannot take this away, this one flame of hope we have for survival.<br/><br/>A future where creatives only work to feed the machines that replaced them is so, so bleak. Granting AI works copyright would undeniably be the death of the professional human creative - not to mention it would elongate thousands, if not MILLIONS of job and tank the economy.<br/><br/>Please, I beg you, take the side of the humans. If you don&rsquo;t, other countries will - and people will flock there, taking their talent and genius with them. If you take the side of the machines, all of the extraordinary, authentic talent and legacy the USA has produced over the past centuries will crumble into a sea of unending, boring AI slop.
