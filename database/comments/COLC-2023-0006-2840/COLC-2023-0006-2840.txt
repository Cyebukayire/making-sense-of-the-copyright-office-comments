There is no doubt that Artificial Intelligence software has enormous potential for reshaping entire industries and changing the way we all do our work on a day-to-day basis. But rather than focusing attention on how to constrain this new technology in order to make it compatible with copyright law, perhaps we should instead acknowledge what AI is finally forcing us to accept: that copyright law itself is a painful and pitiful anachronism. It was never a legitimate function of government in the first place - its inclusion in the Constitution was not as egregious as identifying certain human beings as 3/5 of a person, but certainly a product of similar poor judgment. But now technology (ever since the days of Napster) has laid bare how woefully unsuited copyright law is in the modern age. Should we continue propping it up with more tawdry legislation? Like outlawing automobiles to preserve the dignity of the horse-drawn carriage? Or should we move on as a society to whatever comes next? Let us expend our energies on finding its replacement and leave copyright law in the dustbin of history.
