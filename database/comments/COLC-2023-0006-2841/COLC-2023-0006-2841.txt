AI generated content, in any form, should not be protected by copywrite. There is no way to confirm what material has been used to train a given machine on how it generates content, so whether or not the machine output was made from freely-given input data or stolen data cannot be determined. Therefore, no one can claim ownership of the generation of such content.
