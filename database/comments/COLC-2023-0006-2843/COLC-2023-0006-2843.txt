If any AI programs in the future can consist SOLELY of materials (data) that a creator has given their consent to be used/and (optionally) compensated monetarily for such usage, then I think any creations derived from those AI programs should be able to receive a copyright from the new creator who used those materials in new creation, regardless of the amount of human input.  Right now it is very confusing for an author to even be able to use spell-check or grammar tense checking, or paraphrasing suggestions from programs that say they do not use AI (like Grammarly or Quillbot). A human editor can provide those services, but a non-AI program can do the same thing, much cheaper and faster.  But are those works copyrightable? It has put me into a kind of limbo until the copyright office can figure out guidelines.......I cannot submit to agents or publishers, with a work that cannot be copyrighted....so I wait.
