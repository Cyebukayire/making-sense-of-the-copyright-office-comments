AI is trained on stolen works of art and therefore can never produce something unique. &ldquo;Art&rdquo; (or any other work) produced by a machine should not be able to be copyrighted, as it is not a bespoke piece, and merely an amalgamation of real people&rsquo;s works mushed together. Disallowing ai copyrights will protect the jobs of authors, screenwriters, visual artists, animators, and nearly every other type of artist.
