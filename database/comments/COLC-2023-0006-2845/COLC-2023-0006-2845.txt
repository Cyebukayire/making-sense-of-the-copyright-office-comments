AI models should not be allowed to use works to train without the owner&#39;s permission. Additionally, any AI-generated work should not be eligible for copyright, as a human being was not involved in its construction. And if an AI is trained to mimic a particular artist&#39;s style or characters, it should be considered to be violating publicity rights.
