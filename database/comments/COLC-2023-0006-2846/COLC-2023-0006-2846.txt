AI creates media based on training data that is, the vast majority of the time, not commercially available to those hosting the AI. Anything the AI creates will necessarily be based on and derivative of that unowned work, and so should be illegal to copyright. Unless the entity training and using the AI can prove that it owns the entirety of its training dataset, anything the AI produces should not be copyrightable. <br/>Even then, anything the AI produces cannot truly be considered a creative work, since it is the product of, essentially, a large amount of precisely weighted dice.
