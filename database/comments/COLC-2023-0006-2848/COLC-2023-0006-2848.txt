&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; tools such as Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, and so forth are theft incarnate.  Scouring the internet for source material, making claims that the next step is to break into private websites to collect more &quot;training material&quot;, and using the tools to never give credit to the original authors and artists is not just plagiarism but copyright infringement.  Not only should AI-generated content be barred from receiving copyright status, but the submitters of such content should be fined.  The creators of these tools should also be fined for every infringement past, present, and future.
