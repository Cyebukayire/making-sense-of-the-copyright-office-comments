Allowing AI &quot;creative works&quot; to be copyrighted would be absolutely devastating to actual creative workers (who massively struggle to make ends meet as it is), not to mention it&#39;s morally reprehensible (considering that AI end products are based on stolen work and the back of thousands of low paid, gig workers in impoverished countries. Works that were fed into Ai were taken from the internet, without any consent from artists. It was effectively stolen and Ai companies are making money off programs that use stolen work in their datasets. Ai isn&#39;t artificial intelligence at all, it&#39;s a program using a system that constantly needs &quot;training&quot; (also a misnomer implying that it actually learns when it doesn&#39;t, the data set just gets more defined by the humans tagging it) to actually identify, analyze and produce the content that just seems magically generated when its customer/end user enters a prompt. It basically shifts the work from minimum and decent wage creative workers to low-paid gig work in impoverished countries, paying less and less and offering no job security. It&#39;s simply a means to eliminate more skilled labor and skilled labor wages.
