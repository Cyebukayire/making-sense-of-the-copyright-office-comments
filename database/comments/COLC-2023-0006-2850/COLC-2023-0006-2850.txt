Because so-called &quot;generative AI&quot; (though it is not actually an artificial intelligence of any kind) produces it&#39;s output through algorithmic scraping of previously created copyrighted, public domain, and open license works, and not through any exercise of human ingenuity or artistry, it ought not to be afforded copyright protections under US law.<br/><br/>Further, any artists/creators whose copyrighted works are included in the training material for a generative AI ought to have the right to be informed, and to have their works removed upon request. Where copyrighted works have been used to generate for-profit outputs by AI firms/creators, the original artists ought to be entitled to compensation, since it is their effort, intellect, and skill that have actually created to the project, not the person who entered a brief prompt into a chat box.
