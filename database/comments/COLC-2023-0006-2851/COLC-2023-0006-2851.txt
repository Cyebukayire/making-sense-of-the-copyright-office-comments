AI is trained upon stolen data. This happens either because a user of the AI uploads a piece as reference, thus adding it to the AI model without the creator&#39;s direct intent, or because the piece is on a platform that start scraping the data with an opt out form, witheut notification, leading to the author not knowing that their piece is being used as a part of an AI model.<br/><br/>Besides being formed from stolen data, AI is not an intelligent process. It is a fuzzy process that will provide different results each time, &amp; is not built from the human experience.
