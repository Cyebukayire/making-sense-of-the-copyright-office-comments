AI being used to replace valuable creative works is a shame. Thousands of people have to fight tooth and nail to get into so many of these fields (writing, art, digital media, acting) and now they are being replaced by the lowest bidder: AI. It is the easy thing to do because it involves so little thought or care for others. But it is the wrong thing to do. People should be the ones responsible for our work and our art and our labor. The greed shown by these companies who so easily jump onto the AI bandwagon is frankly disgusting.  Humans make everything possible and deserve to be paid a living wage.
