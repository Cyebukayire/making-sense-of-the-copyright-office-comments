I want to comment as an artist, a creative and someone who has worked in the music industry. As AI has begun to enter the general consciousness of the public, it has allowed for the theft of art. Companies (WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ARTISTS , WRITERS, SINGERS, and PRODUCERS) have stolen work to train their AI. This poses a massive threat in copyrights as artists are now having to defend their works online. Even in academia, we are seeing students be accused of falsely generating works through AI when many haven&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s important that we realize that AI will never be able to replace works created by humans. If we look back at the history that has been made throughout human existence, art has always been at the center of it. AI again&hellip; poses a massive threat to the lives of creatives. Just look at what is going on in Hollywood.
