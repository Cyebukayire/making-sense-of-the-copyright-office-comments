AI with no restrictions is not only theft but it&rsquo;s downright dangerous. It starts by taking our property and then it will take our jobs. It has no place being held to the same standard and esteem as IP. Not one element of it is original and it has already been proven from its origin that people will not use it in good faith in regards to copyright laws and protections. From day one of its genesis it has stolen and corrupted copyright protected property with no care of the repercussions not just by average users but by corporations who know better and care more about feeding their greed to save a buck than to uphold and value copyright law. AI has allowed accountability to become nonexistent from day one. AI is reckless and should not be allowed to be copyrighted under any circumstances.
