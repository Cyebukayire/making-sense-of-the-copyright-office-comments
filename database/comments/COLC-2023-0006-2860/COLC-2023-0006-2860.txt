AI frequently makes use of public information shared for free, but in turns uses it to make a profit, or provide services for others to make a profit. This is theft. Work produced or freely available online should not be allowed to be used by AI without explicit permission by the authors, and if none can be found, it should not be allowed. I strongly believe AI is unreliable compared to people, and unlike people or organisations, holds no liability for cases where work is clearly significantly similar to a real persons work. If no one can be made accountable for cases in which outputs are similar enough that, if another person made them, they would be held under copyright, then AI should not be allowed to use their work at all. It is never okay to steal someone&#39;s intellectual property, and if the thief is an AI, the developers and users of that AI must be held liable. A computer cannot commit a crime, and the people allowing the computer to manage on their behalf are those responsible. We must hold the creators accountable and stop the theft of intellectual property.
