AI generated material should not be protected under any copyright. Artists (and I use this term to represent any and all forms of creative individuals and professions) should be able to choose if they wish their work to be used to train AI and this wish should be respected and enforced. Failure to do so should result in fines and a prison sentence. If an artists work is used to train AI that artist should be compensated either with a substantial lump sum or royalties from anything that AI generates or makes sales from for as long as that AI produces functions and produces work. AI generated products of any form should be declared as such by law allowing consumers to choose which products they purchase and what artists or AI they support. This should be mandatory and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these regulations should be a felony.
