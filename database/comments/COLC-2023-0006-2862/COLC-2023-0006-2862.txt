[Docket No. 2023-6]<br/>Artificial Intelligence and Copyright<br/><br/>I am making this submission on behalf of myself.<br/><br/>General Questions:<br/><br/>Question 27<br/><br/>Answer,<br/><br/>Other issues policy makers should consider.<br/><br/>AI Gen tools are not really tools for artist! I have 40 years experience working at some of the worlds top creative agencies. I have live through and adapted to the digital revolution. I&#39;ve used adobe Photoshop since it was first invented. I use 3D modelling and animation software. But I have no way to use AI image generation software. It&#39;s useless to me as it&#39;s uncontrollable and random! It seems more of a invention for Crypto currency enthusiast to mint random images as &ldquo;art&rdquo; in order to scam people with! I believe it is these Crypto currencies enthusiast that want copyright to add value in some way to their fraudulent activities.
