AI is a problem. It makes it easy for companies to take jobs away from workers, it has made the internet actively worse, and it has made it difficult to truly gage the news. It feels like a big circle of problems and making everything run like the music industry won&#39;t help. <br/><br/>Like, let&#39;s say a news agency wants to write an article. Why hire a journalist when they can just have AI do it? But AI just churns out what is most likely based on stuff in it&#39;s database. And we don&#39;t have any idea what is actually in there. So you get things being, well, false and badly written. People won&#39;t trust it as they don&#39;t know if a person or an AI wrote it  And when it&#39;s published they get revenue based on clicks but was it a person or an AI trawling the internet for more content for their database? And since the article was just published as is, you get an ouroborous of AI LLM. Add in the AI generative art which has it&#39;s issues with both falsehood and racial and sexual bias (since it goes with most likely it goes with stereotypes, people tend to be pretty and white, etc) and you have a recipe for people making chlorine gas. Literally. A supermarket used AI to make recipes for their customers and one was chlorine gas. <br/>Not everyone always knows what is going on either. I used to work as a background actor before my current job. While working on She Hulk, we were all taken aside in small groups to be scanned into a machine. I can&#39;t remember if we were paid, but we were told that it was just to fill in group shots as it was the height of pre Vax covid. Imagine my shock when during the current SAG/WGA strikes it comes out that I was ACTUALLY being used to help create an AI double. There is a version of me on Disney&#39;s servers I didn&#39;t know about. I could be used for ANYTHING and they never need to hire me again. They could use AI to put me in a sex scene, have me say racist, sexist, or LGBTQIA+ phobic things. And they don&#39;t even need to tell me. Plus the knock on effect is the lovely costume, hair, and make up effect people I met are now out of jobs. And because of consolidation and mergers, it&#39;s hard for THEM to get a new job now too. <br/><br/>AI may have a place in certain job markets, like coal mining or other jobs that are actively dangerous to humans but need to get done. Or for chatacters in video games so they can fight. But the AI used now is used more for taking jobs and knowledge away from the public. Used by large companies to pay less for products and for art to just end up as... bland. <br/><br/>As a citizen of the USA, I ask that AI be banned. Making it so it&#39;s like the DMCA won&#39;t work. The DMCA doesn&#39;t really work either.  There will be too many false positives and it will be used by large companies more than the people. Just... ban AI so we don&#39;t get any more eating disorder hot lines being pro anorexia.
