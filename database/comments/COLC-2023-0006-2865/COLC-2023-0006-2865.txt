I am an artist and a writer. I do these things for fun, and rarely make any money on these hobbies, but I do like to share my work online. Recently, I&rsquo;ve had to be careful. New and old social media has been adding things to their terms and conditions, saying they can use my work to train their AI. This is usually tucked away in their terms and condition updates and not easy to know about beforehand and often difficult to opt out of. And this doesn&rsquo;t stop people from uploading my art or writing to a AI training without my knowledge.<br/>My dream is that someday someone will see my work, and hire me for something big or small, be it for my drawings or my stories. But with AI on the rise, my fear is that instead of contacting me and paying me for a job, someone will give a computer a sample of my work and will generate something based on prompts that I would&rsquo;ve pondered and lovingly crafted. <br/>I understand that AI is fun, is useful and can be used to create things that people would not have created. But if you let people copyright something created this way, I fear that corporations will simply cut creators out of the creating. Unless a person has put considerable effort into what is created, unless the artists who were sampled in the AI are credited and compensated for their work I don&rsquo;t feel that the AI generated material should be allowed to be copyrighted.
