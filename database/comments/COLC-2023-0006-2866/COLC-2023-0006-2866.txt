Hello, I hope you&#39;re having a good day, whoever&#39;s reading this. About AI, I personally feel that AI is a major problem for creative communities and copyright. <br/>for example, an author or artist can put hundreds of hours into something, but an AI can generate something in seconds. This takes away what it is to be a creator, to pour your soul into something, because it is unique, it is beautiful, and above all, it is yours, and now you can share it with others, this wonderful thing you have spent so much time and effort on. But with AI, people like us are at risk, because an AI can create things like this completely from nothing, and creators simply cannot compete. And even worse, those who use AI like this can profit from it, even though they did not make it. You shouldn&#39;t be able to copyright something that is not yours, that is simply just the creation of a machine. If you allow people to copyright ideas, writing, characters, art, and other content created by AI, the creative community in itself might very well collapse. We aren&#39;t always visible, but we are HUGE. Just to name a few, Ao3 (Archive of our own), SCP wikidot, The Wanderer&#39;s Library, Fanfiction.net, and countless others. And those are mainly just writing platforms! I know SCP and Wanderer&#39;s Library operate under a creative common&#39;s licence, not sure about the others, but those two I know for a fact have a strict no AI works policy. Why? Because it takes away everything it means to be a creator. To allow someone to ask a machine for a piece of writing, art, or other content, then take that and copyright it? That is just wrong, and it destroys the system. It might seem like AI is a huge financial opportunity, but it takes away what it means to be creative. You have to consider, WHY are we doing these things? Because life is too short, you have to enjoy it, it&#39;s messy, it&#39;s sometimes not fun, but above all, it is beautiful, because we are human. We are alive, full of warmth, thoughts and feelings, and we create. To replace that with a machine? No. It&#39;s just wrong. Thank you for your time.
