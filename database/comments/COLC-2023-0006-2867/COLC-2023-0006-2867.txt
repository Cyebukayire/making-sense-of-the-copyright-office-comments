A major problem with data generated images (or as the study calls it AI images) is that they are &ldquo;learning&rdquo; off of stolen works. They are scrubbing the internet and using images without the consent of the artists, often times using the artists name as a generative field. All without artist consent. And there is no morally correct manner in which to do these as big businesses will continue to utilize stolen art to generate their images. There is no human element to ai. You cant copy right a google search and thats essentially all the users of Ai image programs are doing. It isn&rsquo;t art. Its not even artificial intelligence as the programs are not trying anything new and are instead simply regurgitating a blended up version of images already existing.
