I&#39;m a writer, and multiple book covers I paid for and hold the rights to have been used for training AIs without my permission being sought or given. If an AI is going to be used commercially, for profit, then I don&#39;t see why the profit-seeking business operating it shouldn&#39;t be required to seek permission from the copyright holder for rights to use images or text to develop that system.
