As a writer, I make my living and gain most of my enjoyment from crafting original works of art in text form. I am gravely concerned that this work is now being used for machine learning, in a process that will most certainly eventually put me out of the opportunity to earn any sort of living whatsoever. Copyright is supposed to protect against exactly that from happening, right? Entities taking my work and monetizing it without my oversight, approval, or ability to gain from that? Please take a hard stance on this issue for the sake of creators, without whom this country would be a very bleak place to live right now.
