[Docket No. 2023-6]<br/>Artificial Intelligence and Copyright<br/><br/>I am making this submission on behalf of myself.<br/><br/>General Questions:<br/><br/>Question 27<br/><br/>Answer,<br/><br/>Other issues policy makers should consider.<br/><br/>Prominent legal scholars seem to be spreading misinformation about these systems ignoring the fact that they unlawfully access copyrighted works such as from torrent sites, fan art, and works subject to legal disputes and DMCA claims. They then want to apply copyright to the output of these system by inventing &ldquo;legal fictions&rdquo; such as Andres Guadamuz who participated in WIPO consultations on AI copyright.<br/><br/>&ldquo;why not continue having another legal fiction only for AI works?&rdquo; (https://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/artificial_intelligence/call_for_comments/pdf/ind_guadamuz.pdf. Page 6)<br/><br/>Such an attitude from Guadamuz is reckless as he is proposing to simply ignore laws to allow people like himself, who is known to use AI image gens for minting NFTs, to benefit personally from a &ldquo;legal fiction!&rdquo;.<br/><br/>For instance in the UK IPO consultation he wrote,<br/><br/>&ldquo;In part, I own several non-fungible tokens that were created using generative algorithms, without s9(3) these images are in the public domain, and therefore can be easily infringed.<br/><br/>For now I assume that the works can be enforced in the UK and other countries that have computer-generated works provisions.&rdquo;<br/><br/>He then advised the UK IPO to keep s9(3) (Uk Design and Patents at) due to his own personal interest! This is clearly a conflict of interest!<br/><br/>He then appeared at the UK House of Lords Committee to give evidence and seems to have deliberately mischaracterised EU law saying there  was a &ldquo;commercial use&rdquo; exception for AI training when no such wording appears in the EU DSM Copyright Directive! The UK Government almost walked into a change of law that would have been seriously detrimental to the UK creative economy had it gone through.<br/><br/>See Page 15 of HOUSE OF LORDS<br/>Communications and Digital Committee<br/>2nd Report of Session 2022&ndash;23<br/>HL Paper 125<br/>At risk: our creative future<br/><br/>&ldquo;Dr Andres Guadamuz, Reader in Intellectual Property Law at the University of Sussex and chief editor of the Journal of World Intellectual Property, explained that text and data mining involved copying and analysing large datasets to identify patterns and trends. This is typically done to train AI<br/>algorithms, conduct academic research or support commercial purposes. Mining these data often requires a copyright licence or relying on a copyright exception. The Uk offers exceptions for non-commercial research, among others.<br/><br/>29. In 2019, the European Union amended its text and data mining rules by introducing a change to support commercial mining&rdquo;<br/><br/>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5803/ldselect/ldcomm/125/125.pdf<br/><br/>The parts where Guadamuz says there are exceptions for &ldquo;commercial purposes&rdquo; is simply not true! There is no mention of &ldquo;commercial purposes&rdquo; in Article 4 of the EU DSM Copyright directive. (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj)<br/><br/>In my opinion seems to have been deliberately misleading the UK House of Lords seemingly to encourage a commercial use exception! I don&#39;t know why else he would mischaracterise the  EU law like that!<br/><br/>Similarly if such exception were allowed in the US (Just to please NFT enthusiasts) then the whole US creative economy could be at risk the same way the UK discovered. It would be catastrophic!
