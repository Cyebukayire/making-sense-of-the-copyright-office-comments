Given the nature of how work produced by AI is created, the only thing making that work copyrightable will do is take away jobs. It&rsquo;s basically a vehicle for plagiarism. And while hobbyists who don&rsquo;t have the discipline to learn a craft or take the time to really put in the work can argue that they deserve some sort of compensation for their &ldquo;work&rdquo;, they didn&rsquo;t put in the work. It takes years of practice, love, pain, loss, and dedication to become even sort of good at any kind of art. To allow AI art to be copyrightable is not only state sanctioned plagiarism, it&rsquo;s a quick road to eliminating individual human voice.
