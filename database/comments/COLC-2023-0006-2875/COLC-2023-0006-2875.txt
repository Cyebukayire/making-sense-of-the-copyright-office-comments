AI as we know it today is nothing but theft. These images/content don&#39;t come from nowhere. They are produced by stealing already existing art and content and then putting them through algorithms that is constantly referring back to the original piece. It is by no means original nor is it ethical. It&#39;s theft with a coat of paint.
