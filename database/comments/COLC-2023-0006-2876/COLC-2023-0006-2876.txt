AI programs that seek to generate content like art, writing, and other media are not inherently dangerous. The ways these programs have been allowed to run rampant in the US and the larger world is dangerous.<br/> The databases established to feed these programs use predatory behaviors to collect other people&#39;s creative works without their consent or without compensation. It should be illegal for apps and platforms to automatically opt in their users&#39; content to be collected for these programs. There need to be clear disclaimers, clear contracts/consent forms, and clear wording surrounding attempts to collect content for these AI programs. The practices currently being used to compile databases of content from which these AI programs draw their information from are technically legal, but must be curbed. Furthermore the content produced by these programs must also have strict regulations surrounding them. I am closely involved with municipal governments in the northern Virginia area and have been told by my associates that &quot;artists&quot; seeking to produce public art projects from AI generated material have been approaching them. These &quot;artists&quot; first of all never disclose that they are using AI programs to compile their pieces, and second of all are able to use a variety of bots programs to rapidly target multiple governments in succession. With a foundation of bot-ridden social media and positive fake reviews, they appear legitimate. Thankfully the municipalities I work with were able to recognize the work of AI generated programs and share this information with each other. If no one caught the lies in this proposal I&#39;m afraid of what would happen with several municipalities cashing in on seemingly low effort public art opportunity.<br/>To conclude: the way that these AI generation programs make content is dangerous because it quite often steals people&#39;s art. These artists deserve to decide for themselves whether to donate their pieces, be paid for their work, or refuse their services. The way that these programs distribute their art is also dangerous. Putting art out into the world that has been constructed from other works, especially some which were stolen, is reprehensible. It&#39;s theft, it&#39;s fraud, and it&#39;s a slippery slope to crushing small artists across the nation who can&#39;t even get a copyright for lack of money.
