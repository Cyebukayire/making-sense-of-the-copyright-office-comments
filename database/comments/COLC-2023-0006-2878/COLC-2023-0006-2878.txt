I often find that &quot;AI&quot; art things like pictures, writing, voices, and music, is often the result of people attempting to make a quick buck and scam others off stolen work already created, such as NFT&#39;s or cryptocoins. A lot of AI is trained on existing works, hence the term stolen.<br/><br/>It is also already being used by large companies to abuse and steal the work and likeness of people for acting, be it voice acting, physical likeness, book covers, to actual movements, and justifying it as a means to pay those people who gave it to them, as little as possible with no residues, etc. <br/><br/>I believe the copyright should belong to the original artist whose work was torn apart and put into a Frankenstein amalgamation that is &#39;ai&#39; art, writing, voice acting, and theatrical acting and be paid correctly for such, thus &quot;AI&quot; art as a whole cannot be copyrightable, let alone that AI used to copy a person likeness should be outright outlawed or heavily regulated due to its use in things akin to things such as Deepfakes, which are images created by ai mixing pornographic photos, and normal photos together; as what&#39;s the difference of a company taking a person likeness for one movie than using it in porn film for another, and then causing that person undue backlash and stress from them &#39;crediting&#39; the actor at the end?
