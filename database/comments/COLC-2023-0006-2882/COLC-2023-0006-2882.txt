AI is a misleading name for current technology. What they are is predictive models, choosing words based on statistically likely relationships. The trouble is, they choose these words from their training materials, which include thousands if not millions of works written by people, who did not give their permission for their work to be altered or reproduced. Current AI unquestionably function as a result of IP theft. They contribute to economic hardship for writers and artists, and worsen our misinformation epidemic. The government must take swift, principled action to regulate these algorithms.
