AI should not be allowed to be trained on copyrighted content without permission and financial compensation to the original creator. We have plenty of existing laws around the use of sampling (particularly in music) and there&#39;s no reason they shouldn&#39;t apply here, especially as what comes out of these generators is often recognizably theft from working artists. There is plenty of public domain work for proof of concept training, there is no reason AI creators should be allowed to profit (either directly, or through ads/investment made into their products) from the copyrighted work of others, and at those artists&#39; expense. We have already seen plenty of writers and book cover artists losing jobs to AI. It is both a copyright violation and anti-competitive behavior.
