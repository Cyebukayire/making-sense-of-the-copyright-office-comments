Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a tool that creates something that resembles art, but is not, in and of itself, art, and things produced by these tools should not be legible to be turned into copyrighted materials. The materials produced by the AI itself should be considered open source; because AI tools pull upon preexisting materials, the publishing and attempt to copyright of these produced items is akin to plagiarism, with a slew of impossible-to-site sources. While it can be utilised in the process of creation, perhaps to gain a starting point for one&#39;s own work, there must be meaningful distance between the AI production and the finished product for it to be considered an &quot;original&quot; peace. Within the professional setting, it&#39;s only really suitable to produce ideas, not meant to be seen as the majority of, or even part of, the finished work. While it requires human input to produce something, so does a shredding machine; and while the shredded paper can become a papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; sculpture, it is only through a person that that sculpture was made. In the same way, AI generated materials can only become something legally distinct through transformation at a human&#39;s hand. But just pasting together different AI generated items does not produce an original work; that is not the nature of meaningful art.
