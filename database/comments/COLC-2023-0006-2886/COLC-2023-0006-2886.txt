I work in film and though AI Doesn&rsquo;t affect my department, my concern is for the writers and artists who do work in film.  A.I. has potential to help a lot of areas of work, but it also has the potential to be misused by greedy corporations in an attempt to not pay workers.  Please help the people and workers of this country to save our jobs
