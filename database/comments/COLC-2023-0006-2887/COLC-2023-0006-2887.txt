Artificial Intelligence is more suited for things like gps or phone assistance. Using it for art or writing stories is ridiculous as it takes already existing art and mashes it together in an ugly and often incomprehensible mess. I avoid AI generated anything to the point of downloading blockers to my browser so none of my search results are from AI. I would never watch any show or movie written by AI either.
