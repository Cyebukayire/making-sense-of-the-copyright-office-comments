The use of copyrighted material to train AI is no different than plagiarism. The AI may copy may reuse the material on which it has been trained. Additionally, AI has already been used to write books that were published under the name of the author that they were trained on without that author&rsquo;s consent (Jane Friedman). Amazon, the publisher for the generated books, initially refused her request to get the books removed, despite her lack of consent. Amazon cited her not having trademarked her name as the reason for the refusal. After Friedman made the incident publicly known, Amazon removed the books. Should a less well-known or self-published artist have their work stolen or misrepresented in such a way, it is my understanding that it would be up to the individual judge in charge of the case without an explicit policy from this department in place (if they can afford to pursue legal action without a guarantee of payout). There is nothing requiring DMCA takedowns (or other relevant policies) to the companies that make money on hosting AI generated work, whether it was made with copyrighted material or not.
