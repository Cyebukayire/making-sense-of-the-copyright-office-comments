Re: Copyright Office<br/>[Docket No. 2023-6]<br/>Artificial Intelligence and Copyright<br/><br/>I am making this submission on behalf of myself.<br/><br/>General Questions:<br/><br/>Question 27<br/><br/>Answer,<br/><br/>Other issues policy makers should consider.<br/><br/>Unlawfully accessed material for use in AI Datasets.<br/><br/>Copyright exceptions can only apply to material that is &ldquo;lawfully accessed&rdquo;<br/><br/>However, data has been scraped arbitrarily for AI systems with no care given to whether data comes from Torrent sites, Fan art, disputed works under DMCA, personal medical data and even data relating to serious crimes.<br/><br/>Furthemore, a lot of data for AI systems come from German Researcher LAION. It should be noted that under EU law and German law this researhc data should have been secured and not just handed over to Stability AI inc, and others, for use in training AI systems. Thus NONE of the data used by Stability could be said to have been &ldquo;lawfully accessed&rdquo;.<br/><br/>I would draw the Copyright office to EU DSM Copyright Directive once again regarding Text and data mining.<br/><br/>&ldquo;2. Copies of works or other subject matter made in compliance with paragraph 1 shall be stored with an appropriate level of security and may be retained for the purposes of scientific research, including for the verification of research results.<br/><br/>3. Rightholders shall be allowed to apply measures to ensure the security and integrity of the networks and databases where the works or other subject matter are hosted.&rdquo;<br/><br/>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj<br/><br/>And German Copyright act &amp;60d<br/><br/>Section 60d<br/>Text and data mining for scientific research purposes<br/>(1) It is permitted to make reproductions to carry out text and data mining (section 44b (1) and (2) sentence 1) for scientific research purposes in accordance with the following provisions.<br/>(2) Research organisations are authorised to make reproductions. ʻResearch organisationsʼ means universities, research institutes and other establishments conducting scientific research if they <br/>1. pursue non-commercial purposes,<br/>2. reinvest all their profits in scientific research or<br/>3. act in the public interest based on a state-approved mandate.<br/>The authorisation under sentence 1 does not extend to research organisations cooperating with a private enterprise which exerts a certain degree of influence on the research organisation and has preferential access to the findings of its scientific research.<br/>https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_urhg/englisch_urhg.html<br/><br/>Given that it is well known that Stability AI inc were indeed cooperating with LAION researchers AND had preferential access to the research then they have violated the law.<br/><br/>Therefore, no possible copyright exceptions can exist for the use of the data that has been acquired to train many AI systems that rely on data obtained through LAION researchers as they themselves have violated EU and German law! There has been no &ldquo;lawful access&rdquo; to that data by any AI developer!<br/><br/>That data should have stayed secured at research institutes (EU DSM Directive Art. 3 (2)(3) NOT released to the world like a virus!<br/>
