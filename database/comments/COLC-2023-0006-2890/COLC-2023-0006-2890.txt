Know you&rsquo;ve probably already made up your minds, but being clear here: this technology steals from people. This technology displaces people from what they&rsquo;ve been training to do their entire lives. American people. I&rsquo;m not gonna go full on into it, because again, you&rsquo;re probably going to get lobbied or some little person in a suit is going to say &ldquo;oh it&rsquo;s not so bad&rdquo; but here&rsquo;s the reality of the situation: this tech is made to disrupt, and that disruption isn&rsquo;t worth the toll it makes on the economy, and it it is not worth taking livelihoods and income away from artists, writers and on down the line. And you know what will stop it? Making it unprofitable. Making it non-copywritable. Taking the money they desire to earn from taking the ideas and words and renderings of others and adding nothing, having a machine combine it and claiming that&rsquo;s something worth caring about.<br/><br/>So, like I said, you probably have made a decision before this crosses your stead, and it&rsquo;s probably made by those who would give you money to look the other way. <br/><br/>But it shouldn&rsquo;t be. And I believe that you&rsquo;re better than that. That&rsquo;s the power of creative thought.
