Until there are laws in place protecting the artists, writers, musicians, actors, and every other creative whose work has been illegally scraped and used to train AI tools, it is unethical to allow these thieves to copyright and consequently profit from this theft. There must be laws in place to allow the creators of the source material, and there must be laws in place to ensure that if their work was cited that they receive fair compensation for their contribution. Until a company can show all of their sources AND that they have explicit permission to use them, whatever work is generated from these tools should not be eligible for copyright.
