We are in the middle stages of a war between technology elites and their tools of capital extraction on the one hand, and the great mass of humanity on the other. If that sounds like extreme or inflammatory rhetoric to you, I can only suggest that you lack historical perspective.<br/><br/>The most recently concluded stage of the war began with the illegal exploitation of copyrighted content that fueled YouTube and many other tech hegemons. In the absence of scalable controls to protect the rights of content creators and their agents, those creators had no choice but to take a &quot;if you can&#39;t beat them, join them&quot; approach, resulting in the current regime wherein Silicon Valley defines the terms of the market for human creativity and all others jockey for position within that space.<br/><br/>The current crop of LLMs represents the latest stage of this war. The previous stage relied on unscrupulous anonymous uploaders to infringe rights. In this new stage, these have been totally replaced by sophisticated algorithms that, like the uploaders, do not need to be paid. Unlike the uploaders, they are able to completely obscure their infringement by the pretense that they are creating new content.<br/><br/>Humanity is already on the backfoot in ways too numerous to go into here. Every effort must be made by regulators, in copyright and elsewhere, to strengthen the hand of humanity and weaken the technology elites who seek to destroy everything that binds us together as a society. In this case, to start with, this means that: A) AI-&quot;created&quot; content cannot be copyrighted. B) unauthorized use of copyrighted content in training AI must constitute infringement, and C) copyright regulators must create streamlined procedures that set the bar very low for litigation by human plaintiffs protecting their copyrights.
