I feel very strongly that generative &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is nothing more than cheap mimicry, provides utterly incorrect &quot;information&quot; and should not be used at all in any capacity. It is not capable of real thinking, as evidenced by its inability to answer basic math questions or even the number of letters in words, but it has already proven to provide completely fictional &quot;answers&quot;, in one instance making up court cases and names whole cloth, in others generating whole books of nonsense and putting out harmful data (like books about what fungi are safe to eat). Worse, its datasets are stolen information, scraped from real writers and human beings whose hard work is being used for these lies. It is not intelligent. There is no brain. It &quot;says&quot; what it &quot;thinks&quot; you want to see. It cannot be relied upon for anything. It&#39;s no more sapient than the chatbots of the 2000s like Eliza; the only difference is the hype of techbros lauding it as the next big thing. The art generators are equally awful, using stolen images from professional artists and creating nightmare results. This has to stop.
