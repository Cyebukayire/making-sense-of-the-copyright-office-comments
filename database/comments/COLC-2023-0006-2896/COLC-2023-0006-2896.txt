I believe granting any copyright to works made by AI would be a tremendous mistake. Copyright for artistic mediums is meant to protect the works of artists and allow them to make money off of their work, with AI this concern does not exist. There is noone to benefit except for whatever corporate executive had enough money to publish what an AI spit out. There is no benefit to allowing AI works to be copyrighted but it would also actively harm other works. If it&#39;s possible to make the same money off of, and have the same rights from sponsoring, AI generated works that are completely free to make, why would you ever hire writers and artists? Allowing AI works to be copyrighted would actively destroy jobs across every vcreative industry. This does not even take into account that these AI can only exist by scraping the internet of whatever they&#39;re trying to imitate, meaning their work is not original, it is an imitation of whatever they&#39;ve seen, without any artistic intention that could make using the material that created them transformative. I, truly hope that something is done about AI to stop it from taking the place of people like me, thank you for your time.
