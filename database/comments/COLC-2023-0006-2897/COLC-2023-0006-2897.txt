I am an individual author and graduate student in the sciences with experience in computer data management and novel generation using training data.<br/>AI generation cannot be thought of as meaningfully original work any more than the operation of a digital calculator can be thought of as the work of the calculator itself. AI generation is a mathematical process much like the calculation a digital spreadsheet performs, not an original generative event.<br/>To allow the copyrighting of generated work would be much like copyrighting the process of printing or photocopying an original work as its&#39; own - a process has taken place but it cannot be thought of as new data or work in any meaningful sense.<br/>No human work goes into AI generation once the original algorithm is complete - training the model is as simple as feeding it extant works owned by other people or entities, after which no transformative effort is taken to generate a work that is essentially the average of all its&#39; training parts.<br/>AI is a powerful tool with interesting potential, but it cannot replace intent and creative effort.
