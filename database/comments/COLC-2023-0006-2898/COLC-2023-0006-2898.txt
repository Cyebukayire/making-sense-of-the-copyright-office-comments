AI technology steals from the many creators out there who choose to share their works with the public, puts them in a meat grinder, and spits out barely coherent &ldquo;art&rdquo; that is a disgrace to the very essence of humanity. AI takes out the raw humanity that art represents. It is not only a disgrace, but in a world that already places such little worth on creatives out there, humiliating and a slap in the face to those who have taken the time to perfect their craft. In addition, &ldquo;AI software&rdquo; is a misnomer; &ldquo;plagiarism software&rdquo; is much more fitting.
