I believe AI, in it&#39;s recent form of generating content, should be largely regulated if not entirely banned from use in production of art in any medium. I&#39;ve seen AI been in use all over the internet since last year so I can confidently say that there isn&#39;t any benefit to using it longterm. It steals the job from artists, musicians, actors, everybody, and talents and does its job worse. Major studios have also been using AI to their advantage and hire less people for movie, TV, and music production (and in the middle of the Writers / Actors Strike, no less.) Art and inspiration is an inherently and exclusively human trait, and one that can&#39;t be replicated by any robot well enough to pass off as something meaningful. And people are still trying to use that over actual people only for the sake that it&#39;s cheaper that paying an actual person to do their job, they don&#39;t have to learn a new skill, and all with little to no quality control because AI art is low quality to begin with. It&#39;s like the fast fashion of creativity. Please, AI is something that should be done for the tedious and unnecessary work humans do, not to take over one of our greatest outlets of expression.
