I&#39;ve been drawing and doing creative things for years now, while not particularly a fan of all works, AI does not deserve any place in the workplace nor should it have copyrights for things created with it.<br/><br/>I know many artists, writers, and others who work within some sort of arts are currently suffering with the creation of AI works stealing their own creations- Often without even a glance of permission to the originators.<br/>It is against my morals as a creative person as a whole to allow such a thing to get protection. It simply will become abused overtime, often to not pay a fair rate or amount to creatives or anyone that should be getting paid for their work.<br/><br/>Not to mention how dangerous AI is long-term for the environment, a lot of materials are needed to keep those servers, computers, etc. up and not get harmed overtime from running AI.<br/><br/>Ai, even if a sustainable way to upkeep them, will always not have its own mind. Not the current &quot;AI&quot; we have, nor will it ever.<br/>It simply doesn&#39;t match the true meaning for Artificial Intelligence, It is simply not able to create things on it&#39;s own will and have awareness, all awareness it appears to have at the moment is due to mimicking what others have done and mixing up all examples it has to create something similar that it has been told to mimic if within a certain pattern- which is often why AI is known to randomly give extremely off answers more likely than it will give serious entirely perfect responses you would expect from a living being.<br/>the current AI is not sentient nor intelligent, to state such obvious incorrect statements is nothing but ignorance.<br/><br/>AI is also known to extremely horrible biases and easily influenced into saying horrible things if not stopped by an outside influence.<br/><br/>Simply giving something non-human rights to works it truly didn&#39;t create is unfair and unjust.<br/>All parties MUST consent and be paid, including what the AI takes from. Certain AI is perfectly fine (IE SynthV, which is used to help create smoother songs and sounds with AI from voicebanks with the permission of who the voice(s) come from.) and should be allowed copyrights if it has permission from all parties and is NOT endangering workers or people, but also always SHOULD have a human as the true creator and control. Ai should always be minimal and to help improve people&#39;s lives instead of ruining them.<br/><br/>To simply put it: AI shouldn&#39;t have copyrights. It will simply be abused and used to purposefully lead already harsh jobs (especially in Hollywood and production companies) into worse conditions if given such powers.
