Hi! Thank you for asking for public comment on this issue.<br/>I fully believe that artists should be allowed to have a say in whether or not their material is used for training AI or not. While public domain material may be fair game, material under copyright should require the artist&#39;s permission to be used in such a way. To do otherwise harms writers and artists alike. As a hobby artist, I would not appreciate my works used for training AI, and my livelihood is not dependent on money made. Some of my friends, however, have been impacted and it&#39;s awful to realize that someone did not care about your consent to use your work, and thinks it is ok to damage their primary source of income while ignoring the artist&#39;s right to an exclusivity period under current law.<br/>Please consider creating regulation prohibiting the use of copyrighted works for training AI without the copyright holder&#39;s consent.<br/>Thank you so much for opening this up for comment.
