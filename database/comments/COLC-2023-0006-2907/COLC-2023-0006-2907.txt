Hello, I am a freelancer artist working 100% online, providing a service of custom art pieces for clients worldwide. I am very concerned with unregulated AI allowed to roam freely on the internet and use whatever data it comes across as a resource for its learning. It is a massive threat to the livelihoods and copyrights of artists, writers, actors and voice actors all over in that it illegally takes the likeness of one&#39;s own craft and splices and copies it in a way that will harm the source from whence it came. <br/><br/>Reasonable regulations could ensure this new and advancing technology be used responsibly, but it will most definitely require the consent of those whose creativity it uses. That consent should be both optional, i.e. an artist for example could forbid their art from being used and be able to legally sue for copyright infringement, as well as be monetarily beneficial to the person allowing an AI to use their data in the form of royalties if they allow for use.<br/><br/>In the end, what goes into an AI databank, should be entirely decided by the artist themselves, not those admiring their art and selfishly demanding an AI make them what they want, how they want it and when they want it. If it wasn&#39;t insulting enough, those same people then go to claim they&#39;ve made the art, put in the hours and years of effort to be able to do such a thing when all they did was name an artist and write a vague line about what they want to see.<br/><br/>AI can be a powerful tool of the future, but to be just that, it needs to serve people and not swipe the rug from underneath countless people sharing their creativity and craft with others.<br/><br/>Please consider the time and effort so many have spent to be where they are as creators who make that first draft, who give their voice and likeness to characters, who dream and create. We have worked so hard to be where we are, and to be struck down by people wanting to take the human out of the process is only heartbreaking. It strips away the hope of the creators of tomorrow too. Already many youths who hope to enter into a creative career are discouraged by the looming fear of AI eating up anything they create to ultimately replace them.<br/><br/>We can learn to live with AI, but first AI and those who train it upon the hard work of others, need to learn to live with us. Respect our boundaries, please.
