Artificial intelligence, specifically when used for art, is incredibly harmful, not only to the artists who no longer have a job, but also to the integrity of the product and company. Artificial intelligence&#39;s usage is emblematic of many things currently wrong with the entertainment industry: a lack of respect for the hard work of artists, a lust for money, and the lack of true soul behind many works. This is not to say that all works that utilize A.I. art are soulless or morally corrupt, however, the usage of A.I. art can be viewed as a sign that the company does not truly care.<br/>A.I. art takes real people&#39;s livelihoods and replaces them, but does so in a way that is glaringly obvious and maddening. The usage of A.I. in the arts is unethical and nonsensical. A.I. portraits always come out uncanny, or with certain flaws those with keen eyes can see. A.I. voices always have certain tells, and never contain the emotion or direction that a human voice actor would. A.I. writing will never be as good as human writing.<br/>The only reason one is left to deduce for the popularity of A.I. art is greed. With A.I., there is no need to pay a human being anything. There is no need to work with them, or make accommodations. There is no need to respect them.<br/>A.I. &quot;art&quot; is a poor facsimile of what makes art truly art and should be regarded as something fun to play with from time to time rather than a substitute for the real thing.
