AI must be allowed to train itself on any publicly available work without penalty, so long as it does not replicate copyrighted works. The reason: this is exactly how human creators train themselves: by seeing a great many other works and recombining them in novel ways. By studying publicly available works, AI is not doing anything that would be illegal for a human creator. Conversely, if you prohibit AI from training on public works or having to pay the copyright holders of these works, then the same must apply for human creators who produce derivations from these same works.
