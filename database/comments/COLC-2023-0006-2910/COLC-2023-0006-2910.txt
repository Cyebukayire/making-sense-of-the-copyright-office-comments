Hey there! Kind of short comment here, but I just wanted to get my small voice out here. I&rsquo;m an &lsquo;artist&rsquo;, and despite not being the best at it, it&rsquo;s worrying knowing that people can steal your art and claim it as their own without you having a clue. You put hours of work into even silly little sketches, and when you share them to friends, there&rsquo;s now a chance someone decided to take it and claim it as their own. With AI now being able to do the same, it&rsquo;s even more difficult to feel comfortable putting my drawings out into the world- with one person, the individual could hypothetically be tracked down, but with AI&rsquo;s, it is now just part of it&rsquo;s code and to my knowledge there isn&rsquo;t a guaranteed way to know it stole it in the first place. That&rsquo;s just an example using myself, and I know that my work isn&rsquo;t copyrighted, so it doesn&rsquo;t really hold up I guess. But with copyrighted works, I am sure that it can&rsquo;t be much different. Tracking down AI&rsquo;s that steal is probably going to be like a game of whack a mole where you aren&rsquo;t even confident that the mole actually is using copyrighted works, so I wish you luck in nipping this problem in them bud. - A very small artist
