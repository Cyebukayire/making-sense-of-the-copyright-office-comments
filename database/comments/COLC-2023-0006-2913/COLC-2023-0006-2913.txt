Those who produce and train Artificial Intelligence have stolen the intellectual property of many people. <br/><br/>AI can be an incredibly useful tool, but it should only be trained on days sets within public domain or provided by people with their consent and full understanding. The fact that so many creators of AIs are stealing the images and thoughts of people on the internet without there consent is both invasive and disturbing.<br/><br/>Now, users of the internet have to fear every thing they post online will be used for training an AI. That photos of their lives, art they created, even emails they&#39;ve sent could become part of some collage without their consent or knowledge.
