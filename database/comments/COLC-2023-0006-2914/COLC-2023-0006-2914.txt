I am writing to express my strong opposition to AI using copyrighted materials to learn. In my opinion, this constitutes an infringement of the copyright in much the same way that tracing an exact duplicate would infringe the copyright, since AI does not have the human ability to take inspiration from a work rather than directly copy the work. This poses a threat to the original creators by first infringing upon their copyright and then again by potentially mimicking their work in such large quantities that their work loses value rapidly compared to the cheap AI knockoff works. We should not allow such a blatant infringement to ruin the copyright of artists who need their rights protected now more than ever.
