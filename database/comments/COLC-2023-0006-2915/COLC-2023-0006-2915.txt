AI is a tool, not the final product. If you let Disney run amok with their shitty AI generated intros, *everyone* in the creative business will either be out of a job or will band together to make their own independent shit and the quality of the corporate stuff is going to drastically dip. *we need* actual artists. have you ever even looked at AI art? its hideous.
