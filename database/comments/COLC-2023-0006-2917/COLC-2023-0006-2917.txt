Using AI to create content is theft, there is no other way to say it. It takes the work of other people and claims it as it&rsquo;s own when it simply isn&rsquo;t, it is a tool used by scalpers who wish to use the work of others for their own benefit. It creates nothing new or original, it only poorly regurgitates work, whether that be art, voice, written word, etc. Worst of all it does without without the consent and permission of the original creators who poured their souls into their work. You should never be allowed to copyright something you don&rsquo;t own or you didn&rsquo;t create, so AI should not be valid for copyright, and if AI used the work of another, that person should be allowed to file a copyright claim against the person who scalped their work for AI.
