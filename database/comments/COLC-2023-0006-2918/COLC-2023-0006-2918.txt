Artificial Intelligence is already changing many things we take for granted, for the worse. From search engines to advertising, many companies are seeking to use AI to do the work that artists, writers, programmers, and others used to do. These AI models all have to be trained on those very people&rsquo;s work who they seek to replace and often times without their permission. Copyright laws have often been used to keep works out of public grasp and has led to many intellectual properties disappearing completely when they stop being profitable for the company, but are still not in the public domain. <br/><br/>Allowing companies to copyright AI work, would hurt workers, art, and would reduce the quality of services and products across the board. We have a chance to keep this from happening and it must be taken or things will continue in this downward spiral towards corporate control.
