Hello, I am Alysha Foster and I am concerned with AI due to its threat against copyright and the livelihoods of artists of all kinds. The technology has already done damage due to lack of regulation, and threatens to do more as seen with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without regulation, these corporations would replace these artists with AI because it is cheaper, costing those artists their livelihoods. Regulations could help make sure that we use this new technology in the most responsible and productive way possible, without sacrificing the livelihoods of artists or infringing on copyrights and still allowing for innovation.
