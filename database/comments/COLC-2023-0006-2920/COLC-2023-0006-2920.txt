Hello Everyone,<br/><br/>My name is James Easterly, from Michigan. <br/><br/>Although machine learning artificial intelligence (AI) systems have potential, their use today (as of 8-31-2023) violates and abuses the fact there are no regulations on these technologies, and takes materials made by others without compensation and recognition. In short, many people&#39;s livelihoods are at risk if there are no protections in place to safeguard what is and what will be online (or otherwise) from machine learning artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/><br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) should NOT be afforded any copyright protection if they do not comply with basic copyright protection laws that should be written in favor of the original rights owners of a piece(s) or work(s).<br/><br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) should be required to request permission from rights holders to use their work(s). These requests should NOT be implemented in terms of use agreements for platforms, and should always remain optional as to not prevent users of platforms from using said platforms. <br/><br/>For example: If Twitter-X changes their terms of agreement to force users to accept xAI or any X-Corp (or other AI system) or risk having their accounts closed, suspended, or terminated, their actions would be found in violation of new Artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) laws and would be required to have such a request be nested in their platform setting options as a toggle on-off switch which also prompts the user with a I understand these optional terms of agreement, and also recognize that I can opt out at any time, immediately terminating any permissions I as the user give to said platform to use my work(s) for Artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise). <br/><br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) should be required to build ethically sourced libraries of materials that are either created by the owners of the Artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) or acquired through open submissions, licensed, or commissioned work(s). <br/><br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) that are made for personal use, or made accessible to companies, should be required to use that same means of ethically sourced material (as mentioned above) for these systems to be functionally useable. If any conflict arises in regards to formulating an ethical means to implement personal artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise), then reference the paragraph below in regards to water marked materials. <br/><br/>Any Artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) that sources material online without permission of the rights holder should automatically be watermarked upon generation of said material. If material is written, said written material should not be accessible via copy-paste tools-functions on said computers. All work(s) created using artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) in this manner should NOT be eligible for copyright protection. Rather, these images, video, text, music, and any other materials created through artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) would be regarded as reference work(s) that unethically sourced their materials, and as such are not legally protected by copyright law. <br/><br/>These work(s) created with artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) can still be generated, but not used in their given form as means for financial gain, sold, or used to replace or risk the status of a person or persons status of employment. <br/><br/>Those who option their work(s) to any artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) must have clear and understandable terms of use agreement contracts that afford those who are submitting their works to terminate any agreement at any time. No agreement will hold power to hold the original works of a person or persons in perpetuity. No contract or agreement will have any clauses that would allow continued use simply because of a minimum use agreement. All contracts will have a finite termination and require for contracts-agreements to be reviewed and resigned after a term limit of 10 years maximum. If the owners of an artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) fails to contact the rights owner of the original works, the owner of said artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) will be in violation of new Artificial intelligence (AI) systems (machine learning or otherwise) laws and be required to pay damages, or risk more severe punishment.<br/><br/>We need to protect those creating original works. Protect our humanity. Protect our rights.<br/><br/>Do the right thing for humanity and protect us from unchecked AI.
