As an author, and artist, I find it frankly grotesque that these AI companies are allowed to scrape what we have spent hundreds and thousands of hours on, to feed into algorithms that make cheap knockoffs.<br/>What I have created belongs to me, for me to sell or give out as I please, and I do not give consent to these people to use my copyrighted material to create derivatives.<br/>All copyrights material needs to be purged from their models, and a new fully opt-in model needs too be created in its stead, if AI is to even be allowed to continue.
