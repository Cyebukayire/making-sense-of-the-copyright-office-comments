Allowing private companies to ingest copyrighted material in order to produce their large language models was a mistake from the beginning, and has allowed public sentiment to sway.  Leaving aside whether generative AI provides a service the public needs or wants (itself questionable), the fact is that no author or copyright holder has been asked for permission to use their work in the creation of the AI training.  This is copyright violation--indeed, piracy--on a massive and publicly visible scale.  If it is not stopped, if it is allowed to continue, it will begin to erode the importance of copyright protection, in public perception.  We&#39;re already hearing that in discussions.  &quot;It&#39;s not copying your work, so why should you be concerned?&quot;  <br/><br/>Without the government taking a firm, clear, and vocal stance, we can expect the ingestion to continue, perhaps halted piecemeal by individual lawsuits.  But while lawsuits have been valuable in outlining nuances of copyright protection, it would be better to have clear regulations before that point.  We need society to understand that protection of copyrighted works is a necessary part of the underlying machinery of our economy.<br/><br/>And let&#39;s be clear:  The fact that this affects authors and artists, rather than corporations that hold patents, is probably key to the tepid response.  If a generative AI were ingesting intellectual property from, say, pharmaceutical or computer chip manufacturers, to create an infinite number of new patents, building on their work without compensation, there would be a legal row like we have never seen before.  <br/><br/>Authors and artists work on a smaller scale.  Most of us do not have billion-dollar intellectual property, and the law firms to protect us.  But our books, our drawings and paintings, are being used without our permission and without compensation, to create derivative artworks in a way that must surely violate our rights.  So we look to regulation to help us.
