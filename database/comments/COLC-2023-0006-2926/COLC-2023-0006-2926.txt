I hate AI because it steals from artists. I&#39;ve heard of people having their writing getting used to feed into AI software without their consent. I&#39;ve seen AI &quot;art&quot; that was trained using work from artists I admire, without their consent. It&#39;s making it harder to earn a living as an artist of any kind.
