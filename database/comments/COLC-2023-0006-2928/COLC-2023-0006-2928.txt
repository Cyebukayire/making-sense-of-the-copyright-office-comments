As an author, I am deeply concerned about the use of AI to generate inferior product based on the recombination of existing writing. The recognizable plagiarism in the product is more offensive than its quality, but both are a problem. I would urge all industries to ban its use before people who are concerned only with profit destroy an occupation as old as the written word itself in favor of the plagiarism machine.
