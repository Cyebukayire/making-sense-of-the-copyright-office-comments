As a published author, I am deeply concerned about Artificial Intelligence and Copyright infringement. One important factor here is the phrasing--the current writing programs are not &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; in the sense of a machine that can learn or think, but instead are &quot;large language models.&quot; In other words: plagiarism machines. The ability to scrape phrasing, words, and style from copyrighted material and reconfigure them into a believable new sentence is not art nor creativity, but theft. <br/>Visual art is experiencing the same type of theft-- the content the AI generators are using was created by real people with legal copyright protection. Technology that borrows style, content, design, phrasing-- all hard and thoughtful work done by creators--  to manufacture patchwork &quot;new&quot; material should not be allowed or protected by law. <br/>Copyrighted work should continue to be protected from theft.
