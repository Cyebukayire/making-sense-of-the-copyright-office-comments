Machine Learning, also referred to as Artificial Intelligence, re-uses copyrighted work from corporations and individual to generate a product. The resulting product is not inherently unique and derives its entirety from the original copyrighted works. Applying a filter to a copyrighted images does not revoke the original author&rsquo;s legal protections. Machine learning is simply a more complex filter that seeks to circumvent copyright protections by using a large number of copyrighted works in order to dwindle the legal protections of any one group or person. In my humble opinion, it would be inconsistent with the current law of the land to offer copyright protection to machine learning results, or to take away the protections of the original authors of unique works. In addition, machine learning is unable to exist without original authors since machine learning is not capable of unique or original work by itself. Machine learning could potentially hurt several industries without replacing or aiding the original industry. The serious economical and cultural impacts can&rsquo;t be understated.
