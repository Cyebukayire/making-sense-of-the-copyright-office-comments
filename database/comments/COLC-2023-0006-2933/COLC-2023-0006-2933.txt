As someone who has worked as a federal contractor for five years and written articles for federal magazines, I cannot overstate enough that the use of AI will destroy our society. AI cannot be allowed to cannibalize our writers and then dominate the space. American writing and American art and the same WORLDWIDE will be the victims forevermore if we do not do something to combat the rise of AI. They are already stealing work form artists to feed their language models- if this continues, corporations and massive organizations will profit unjustly off of the work of small, hardworking artists, who already are refused their fair share in revenue. This will entirely destroy the economy of art and writing as we know it. Reminder as well for the uninitiated that the use of AI voice models is already being used to mimic the voices of politicians and AI writing erroneously used to make up court cases when lawyers look up arguments. Students use it to cheat in school. This cannot be allowed to be copywritten- not now, not EVER. It is already destroying communities online where it is popular- it will wreck absolute havoc on American society and the world if we let it. Do what is right and just and allow artists to keep their intellectual property their own- and disallow this sham of AI predictive language models and the like to be used for profit at the expense of artists, creators and small business owners.
