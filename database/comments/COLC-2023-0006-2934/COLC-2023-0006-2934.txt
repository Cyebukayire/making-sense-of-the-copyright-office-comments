First, we are not even discussing AI. We&#39;re discussing a program that operates solely on consuming the work of others, much of it copyrighted, and then regurgitating material that uses the most-often-occuring things that match a prompt. While humans can create works that are inspired by others and use their own experiences, so-called AI cannot. It can&#39;t create something on its own. It cannot create something entirely new. Studies have already shown that these programs, when trained on material from other programs even after being trained on material from humans, become degenerative within just a few iterations. That speaks to the difference between real, copyrightable works, and programs that just fiddle around with averages. I cannot believe that protecting material made from a prompt machine is even up for discussion. That&#39;s not even considering the stagnation in the arts that would occur.
