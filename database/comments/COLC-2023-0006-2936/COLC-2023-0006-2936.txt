AI works of visual, audio, or written media should not be able to be under copyright. Not only would this rob human artists of control over their works--works AI must scrape and reuse to place together into an averaged out collage--it would ultimately create massive job loss for these creatives. The draw of using AI technology to make lower quality work faster and cheaper would be a nigh insurmountable draw for the same people that refuse to pay their current employees properly for the work they do. After all, AI cannot unionize. <br/>The fact of the matter is, in our current system, people need to work to live, and copyrighting AI media would harm both the people who have already done work--the material it has scraped--and the people who would otherwise do the work being contracted out to AI.
