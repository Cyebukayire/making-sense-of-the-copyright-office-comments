It is my belief that AI technology as a generative tool (being used to create images, text, and/or audio) is being used to steal creative endeavors from artists. The programmers of these tools take anything they can get to use as input without getting the creators permission to use their work, this then allows them to copy that creator&#39;s work. This will not only lead to copying and making things mimicking art, but mimicking people in their every day lives. The potential already shown in Revenge Porn being made using generative photo programs, video and photo evidence being able to be made for crimes someone didn&#39;t commit, becoming indistinguishable from real images as the technology improves. Allowing unregulated and open source generative tools will break down many systems in America and the world at large.
