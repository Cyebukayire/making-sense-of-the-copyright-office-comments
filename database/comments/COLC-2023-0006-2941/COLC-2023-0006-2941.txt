I believe that the continuous use of AI to replicate the types of art work usually made by human beings is a dangerous path. AI has been used to write scripts, as well as replicate voices and faces of actors and steal visual artwork from artists - all without their consent or even knowledge. There needs to be more regulations on the use of AI, and studios cannot be allowed to replace their actual human cast and crews with AI to reduce the cost. Please consider restricting the use of AI.
