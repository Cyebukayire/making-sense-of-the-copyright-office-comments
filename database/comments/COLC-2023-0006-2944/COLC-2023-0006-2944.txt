I find it rather questionable that the use of A.I. Art apparently uses databank from already existing artwork. In other words, it seems to use other people art with permission to while also giving them (the people who the A.I. Took art from) is at a huge disadvantage. Some people need the manoey they do for their artwork, and the A.I. Does it for them, for free, while stealing other people art to do their own.<br/>To me it kind of feels like glorified Art theft.<br/>And I&#39;m even more concerned about the A.I. Voice. For one, people are using it to perfectly imitate dead people voices to make them sing songs (like Michael Jackson) using their actual voice line to do so. And while it can be kind of amusing, I think it&#39;s also kind of disrespectful for the dead. And while it is no doubt fascinating that human technology is even able to accomplish these things, it could also VERY easily be used against people. I&#39;ve heard A.I. Voices that managed to imitate a person voice perfectly. Imagine some would use this to accuse someone of doing something they didn&#39;t do. They could fake voice messages perfectly and use it as evidence.<br/><br/>In conclusion, artists don&#39;t consent to having their art used by A.I. to their disadvantage, and from what I&#39;ve see. So far they seem to be rightfully upset about this.<br/>Dead people cannot consent to having their voice banks being used for whatever people are using it for. A.I. Users in general don&#39;t seem to ask for permission even when using the voice of someone still living. Yet again, their voice is used without their consent.<br/>I&#39;m not really sure if A.I. Writing is using other people writing (though if it does, then the same thing counts as for A.I. Art)
