Nothing created my AI is original. All it does is steal artwork from different people, regardless of consent, and mash it together. It does not credit any of the artists&#39; whose work has been scraped to create a new image. Artists should have a right to determine how and when their art is allowed to be used, which the current algorithm does not account for. If AI were to grow in the future, it would need to have artist consent built into the system. Allow artists to put work into the machine learning if they wish to, but they should be automatically kept out of it.
