There is no AI. Not in the sense that people are concerned about, anyway. There is no computer anywhere on the planet that is capable of having an autonomous idea or making an autonomous decision, and there won&#39;t be in your lifetime. Or your children&#39;s, or your children&#39;s children&#39;s. AI is a problem we will not have until at least the 23rd century, because not only do we not have any, we are not even CLOSE to having any. <br/><br/>What we do have is machines that are capable of following a recipe, but they will follow it exactly the same way every time. We try to pretend they make &quot;intelligent&quot; changes to the recipe by using a &quot;seed&quot; to generate pseudorandom numbers to index into a preselected set of variations, but that seed is just part of the recipe. We try to make the variations appear arbitrary by having a very large set, preferably selected from a database generated specifically for this particular machine, which no other machine has. This conceals the reality that the machine is NOT having ideas or making decisions or exercising agency. <br/><br/>What it is doing is following the instructions of people, using a database provided by people, to produce a result requested by people. It is people all the way down. None of the decisions come from the machine; the machine has no agency, it has no will, it has no desires or fears or hopes or dreams. It is a machine. Absent a human operator, it generates nothing, because it depends on that operator to have the creative spark. The machine is INCAPABLE of creating. Whatever comes out of the machine, it did not create, any more than a printer has &quot;written&quot; the words that are printed on the paper. It is trivial to write a program that produces words no human being ever wrote, by following a few simple rules - in the 1960s, we colloquially called this the &quot;Dissociated Press&quot; algorithm, and when we wanted to sound smart we called it Markov chains. But the machine produces the words by being handed a body of text written by humans. It is a recipe to remix and reorganise HUMAN writing, in a way that looks and sounds like human writing, but isn&#39;t. <br/><br/>We have always recognised the use of that input data as a fair use, because the results are clearly transformative. They look nothing like the original, and because the processing of the input is statistical, the original input isn&#39;t even maintained; what persists in the input data is the commonalities among text, just as the image databases for diffusion algorithms represent the commonalities of images, and arguably these commonalities are solely the elements of each individual input that are not eligible for copyright anyway - they are the general principles of the input, the ones devoid of unique expression. <br/><br/>It is unacceptably early in the development of this technology to question whether a machine can own a copyright - clearly, it cannot. Where there is copyright to be owned, the machine&#39;s operator owns it; where there is infringement, the machine&#39;s operator has infringed. The machine itself can be neither credited nor blamed.
