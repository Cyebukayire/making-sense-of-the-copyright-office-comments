I am an illustrator who has been working in the industry for a bit over a decade, in various roles from children&#39;s publishing to game art to commercial, editorial pieces. I also teach art to higher education and postgraduate students.<br/><br/>Making a living even with an established career was already tough, due to how common outsourcing work to poorer countries is in many industries that make use of artists&#39; skills. I have seen over and over that the quality and integrity of the artwork commissioned, as well as of the product sold to customers, is not so much a concern to the companies hiring artists, who choose instead the cheapest option. In plenty of cases, this cheapest option was already someone using pieces of imagery and/or ideas found on the internet, without authorisation and unsourced, and passing them off as their own creation in order to earn money. Should that happen to myself, I trust I have grounds to sue for copyright infringement, and am glad for that legal protection.<br/><br/>This is not the case with so called &quot;AI&quot; computer generated imagery that comes out of a machine learning algorithm. My work that I share online, for professional portfolio, commercial, or community purposes, is not protected in any way from being scraped by these algorithms and later used to generate new imagery. As artists we are never asked for consent in such usage and are not paid royalties or compensated in any way. This image generation software is being pushed as a new way for corporations, in any industry, to acquire the imagery they need for very cheap. While the software is nowhere near &quot;intelligent&quot; enough at the moment to replicate the reasoning and thought process a human being puts behind each creative piece, the quick advancement of these algorithms is concerning, and they are regardless still being used in many contexts.<br/><br/>The work of artists could be taken over by this type of software that would not exist at all without stealing the work artists have done, which it is trained on. Artists are increasingly out of work and not compensated in any way for their role in the building of this software - which most did not want in the first place. Moreover, artists whose names and visual styles are a brand and their source of income have had these algorithms used to freely create fake artwork that looks like theirs. Even websites that specifically host artwork and portfolios offer no protection from having your work scraped. In fact, some even automatically opt you in for this without notice.<br/><br/>The promise of automation is a world where we can focus on joyful pursuits and dedicate our time towards what we wish instead of what needs be done for survival. People do not go into art careers to be rich and famous; we do so because we are passionate about the stories we tell through our work. These machine learning programs generate soulless, thoughtless mockeries of artists&#39; work by literally frankensteining pieces of art without artists&#39; consent or knowledge. They are then used to put artists out of work.<br/><br/>Myself and another five artists spend fourty hours each on a piece of work, creating six artworks that are a culmination of decades of training, study, and thought. We would of course ask that we are compensated fairly for our work - both in time and expertise. A seventh person takes our artworks without asking and cuts them into pieces, randomly assembling a new image that makes little sense (they don&#39;t understand what makes a good piece of work) but is aesthetically pleasing (due to being collaged from the work of professionals), which they can sell to similarly untrained clients who only want a pretty picture, fast and cheap. This thief only spends ten minutes on this process, so they can afford to charge way less than the artist who put in fourty hours. The artist never even knows this happens and eventually gives up on this career, despite their work being clearly valuable.<br/><br/>We quickly shift to a landscape of superficial, empty, incredibly similar images while more people are forced into work that hasn&#39;t yet been automated, or out of their homes, and taught that there is no value in the pursuit of creativity. There is only senseless waste and overproduction, and there is no space for anything else under capitalism. Expressing yourself through artwork, putting in work to learn a new skill, putting in the effort and critical thinking to create something - all of these things that are important to healthy, happy societies are being stripped away. The automation of image making is just a tiny facet of this issue, but we cannot deny it still plays a role and that it can lead to awful consequences if its growth continues unchecked and without legal repercussions.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
