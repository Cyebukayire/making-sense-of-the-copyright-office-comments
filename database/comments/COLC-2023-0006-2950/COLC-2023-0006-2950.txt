AI needs to be regulated, and it needed to be regulated months ago.  The harm it&#39;s already done to the art community alone by scraping websites without artist&#39;s consent to &quot;train&quot; their program is disgusting.  They could have asked for volunteers, but instead pushed on all for &quot;innovation&quot; sake.  Now anyone can type in an artist&#39;s name (living or dead) and make a digital picture in their style without them knowing and sell it as their own work. The average person thinks because they found the image on Google that it&#39;s free to use however they want.  If the artist somehow hasn&#39;t been trained in the system yet, anyone can just plug in pictures and do it themselves.  How is that not blatant copyright infringement?  An now that they&#39;ve been unregulated for this long AI is copying voices and text now.  Voices is what scares me the most with the amount of misinformation that&#39;s already out there.  AI is just adding to it.  It does WAY more harm than good right now in its infancy and it needs to be stopped.  Please consider all the harm it has already done and the bigger harm it can do and put a stop to it.  It&#39;s already too late.
