Artificial intelligence should not be used to replicate the work or style of artists of any kind, but especially not without their permission. Artificial intelligence is not capable of creating without the aid of artists, and the owners of the Al are using it to produce copies of artist work without paying them. This must be stopped as soon as possible.
