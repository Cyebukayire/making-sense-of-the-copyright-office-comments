I think that something must be done to limit AI&rsquo;s access to human beings&rsquo; work. AI takes something that took hours upon hours to create by a person and produces countless copies in seconds without adding credit to that person. This hurts the people and work that AI used to create its final work, and copyright law must be updated to stop that from happening.
