Thanks for opening this up to public comment. Artists have the right to decide what happens to their copyrighted works, including exclusive right to create derivative works. It is my opinion that training AI on copyrighted works without the creator&rsquo;s permission violates this right. I think the copyright office should declare AI trained on copyrighted works without permission to be copyright infringement.
