There should be regulation in place for AI creations, it&#39;s has made the life of artists more difficult due to it being trained on their uploaded pieces without permission(not just art that comes in the form of pictures, but writing and now even animating as well)<br/><br/>Many in the art community(including myself) find that these programs are going to lose them potential jobs and livelyhood, and I agree with that concern.
