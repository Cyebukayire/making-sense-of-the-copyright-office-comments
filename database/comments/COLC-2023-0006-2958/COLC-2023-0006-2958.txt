As it stands, the newly developed field of AI Art is entirely built off of taking the artwork of others first- which is almost always done without permission from the owner of those images. One way or another this technology is going to continue to be developed and refined, but if nothing is done, art theft will be done more and more frequently for the sake of AI Art generation which drastically harms the career opportunities of human artists. Action must be taken now, while the field is still young, to ensure a future where humans can freely create art and securely own it.
