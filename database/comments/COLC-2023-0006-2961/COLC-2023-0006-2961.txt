While the de facto state of copyright in this country is unbalanced and overly favorable towards large corporations, the intended spirit of copyright is to help provide a favorable environment towards artistic and creative endeavors in this country. Generative AI programs, such as latent diffusion style programs for art and visual media, as well as large language models for literature and written media, are dangerous to the already fragile creative environment. As such, regulations should be put in place in order to curtail the monetary effect on these programs.<br/><br/>I do not believe that Congress possesses sufficient political will to outright ban these technologies, and so the genie is out of the bottle as it were. However, people seeking to profit off of their work must still interact with the legal system. As such, my suggestions are below.<br/><br/>1. As per the recent judgement against AI generated media, any media completely generated by AI should enter the public domain immediately.<br/><br/>2. Any work which creators submit to the Copyright Office, in order to affirmatively prove ownership of the work, must display a sufficient quantity of the work progress in order to gain the copyright. <br/><br/>3. If a work possesses AI elements, but the human contribution is sufficiently noteworthy that it qualifies for copyright despite being initially AI generated, the creator must provide initial wholly AI generated media, as well as the method(Which model was used, which seed was used, which settings were configured). The Copyright Office would make this information available to the public, such that they could work with the original AI media, which is public domain, and generate it from scratch themselves.<br/><br/>4. If a company seeks to establish copyright over some property, and obfuscate the AI origin of the components of the work, they should be subject to regulatory fines depending on the severity of the situation, and at the discretion of the agency, be stripped of the copyright of the works derivative of the AI generated work, which would then instantly enter the public domain.<br/><br/>5. If possible, a digital watermark should be applied to generated works. It may be tampered with or evaded, but the intent is to raise the cost and difficulty of circumventing the law.<br/><br/>6. It is possible to create a human generated work, and then apply AI to improve it. Such as writing a paragraph, and requesting a LLM to rewrite it in a better prose, or drawing a picture and running it through a latent diffusion model to improve the image. The initial human input should be copyrighted as normal, but the generated improvement should still enter the public domain, as it is similar to writing a first draft, and then requesting a ghost writer to write a better version. At that point, copyright could be granted as above, when sufficient human change or addition changes the work such as to have significant human involvement. <br/><br/>I look forward to the Copyright Office helping to straighten out this particularly thorny legal issue which threatens the livelihoods of all creators.
