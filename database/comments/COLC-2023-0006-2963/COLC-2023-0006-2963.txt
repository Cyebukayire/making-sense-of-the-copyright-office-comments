To whom it may concern: first of all, I can&rsquo;t even submit the form to you without signing a captcha that literally says &ldquo;I am not a robot&rdquo;.    I support my family as a composer, and my work has been featured on thousands of television episodes over the past ten years. It took me an additional 15 years to develop that skillset to get to this point.  Many of my close friends as well.  Knowing how difficult the entertainment has become after the technological advancements of streaming alone, and considering how quickly ai models have already begun being put into use, I have absolutely no doubt that these new technologies will simply become a cost cutting tool as the entertainment industry replaces accomplished professionals with &ldquo;self checkout cashiers&rdquo;.   What is clearly worse is that ai models  can only be trained on pre existing material, meaning you can program it to sound like me to suit your needs by feeding it my entire catalog of scoring work, and not have to pay it for my lifetime of experience, or have it feed my kids.  These new technologies must be reigned in and governed if the entertainment/music industry are going to survive.  It is theft, it is criminal however it is not punishable by law.
