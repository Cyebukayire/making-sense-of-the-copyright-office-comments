Many AIs currently in the market are trained off of data from the wider Internet, primarily smaller artists and writers. These AIs train off the work of others for a profit without credit or payment to the original party. Unregulated AI may have serious consequences for upcoming artists in the industry, including writers, artists, actors, etc.. AI can be a wonderful tool with regulations put in place to prevent theft of the work of unwilling parties.
