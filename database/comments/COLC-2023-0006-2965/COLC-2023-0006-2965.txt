While there may be many uses of AI that will benefit the national good and forward human enterprise, none of those uses warrant the granting of the protection of copyright.  I encourage the Copyright office to take the strongest line against granting copyright against works that are wholly or even partly derived from AI.  Simply put, in its current state, AI represents complex computer models for vast sums of human knowledge and their usage dissolves substantial ownership of any derivative works or ideas to the point where attribution of copyright should be not permitted.
