I am strongly if the opinion that copyright should apply only to things created primarily through human creativity. AI can be a useful tool, when trained in a way that does not violate the rights of other creators, but the work to be copyrighted should be something which is a product of the human Creator&#39;s mind and intent. Things created with minimal human interaction and no human revision should not be copyrightable.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I feel that the processing of a work of art to train an AI model without the permission or even notification of the original artist is a violation of that artist&#39;s copyright. Certain AI usages, such as asking the model to produce something &quot;in the style of&quot; an artist covered under copyright, calls upon ingested works by that artist and uses information extracted from that work to produce something explicitly intended to replace that artist&#39;s work. That is plagiarism.
