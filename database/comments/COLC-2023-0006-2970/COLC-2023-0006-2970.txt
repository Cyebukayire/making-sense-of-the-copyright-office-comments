There are several areas in which machine learning needs additional regulation:<br/><br/>1) the sources uses to train ML need to be transparent to ensure laws aren&#39;t violated<br/><br/>2) copyright should be strengthened to ensure that a copyrighted work is never used to train ML without the copyright holder&#39;s express permission <br/><br/>3) work that is the product of ML needs to be explicitly labeled as such in publication and advertising<br/><br/>4) only contracts that explicitly reference ML should be interpreted to grant the right to use material to train ML<br/><br/>5) material generated via ML *should* be eligible for copyright, but the copyright should belong to the owner(s) of the material used to train the ML<br/><br/>6) if training materials cannot be transparently represented, no copyright should be awarded<br/><br/>7) if training materials were gathered from a significantly diverse collection of copyright holders (hundreds+) then no copyright should be granted<br/><br/>8) manufacturers of ML software should be liable for outputs that are slanderous, libelous or otherwise criminally fraudlent
