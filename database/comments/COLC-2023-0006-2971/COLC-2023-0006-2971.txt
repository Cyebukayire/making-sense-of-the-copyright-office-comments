As an artist and creative person, it&#39;s in my opinion that AI (or as it accurate is human-assisted generative processes) should not be copyrighted or protected as it is ultimately derivative of actual works and ideas. It&#39;s barely justifiable as fair use, satire or parody. Ai doesn&#39;t deserve more rights than humans so please don&#39;t treat it like it does.
