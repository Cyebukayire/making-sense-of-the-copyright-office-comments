This is an awful technology that will be used by media companies to devalue and eventually eliminate human creativity. It will produce a bland simulation of human work while putting good people out of jobs in the name of cost savings. Moreover; the most well-known AI models have been covertly trained on copyright-protected work without the authors&rsquo; and rights-holders&rsquo; permission or compensation in order to create derivative works. This is theft. You must limit the use of AI to prevent this!
