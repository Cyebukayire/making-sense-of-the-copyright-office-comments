There is absolutely no way for any kind of AI to create anything without copyright infringement. Everything an AI system knows is stolen information. It is not capable of creating anything new; it is only capable of stealing and organizing that theft into a format that appears to be something new. It is one thing for it to be used in contexts such as answering questions customers have about troubleshooting a printer or something of that nature. But for AI to be generating fiction, or scripts, or anything else that is copyrightable because historically an individual human mind has conceived it? The only way this is possible is through blatant theft of intellectual property. If AI programs are allowed to steal IP, then humans must also be allowed to steal IP. If AI programs are allowed to copyright what they have created using that stolen IP, then copyright laws are no longer relevant in any situation. Corporations are going to use these technologies exclusively to steal from humans and avoid having to pay workers, and letting them do so will be the end of so many important industries.
