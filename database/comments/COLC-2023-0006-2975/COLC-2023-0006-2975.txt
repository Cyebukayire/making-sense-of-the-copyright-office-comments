To the extent that (1) the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models is deemed fair use and (2) the human whose prompt causes an AI model to generate AI-generated content is not deemed to be the &quot;Author&quot; and the content is, therefore, not deemed eligible for copyright protection: the developer/owner of the AI model should be liable for any AI-generated content that infringes on existing copyrights. The developers/owners of AI models should not be able to have their cake and eat it too. They should not be able, on the one hand, to claim fair use for their unauthorized use of copyrighted content to train AI models while simultaneously, on the other hand, disclaiming liability for AI-generated content that infringes on third parties&#39; copyrighted content.<br/><br/>Just as humans are liable for copyright infringement under the subconscious copying doctrine, so too should the developer/owner of an AI model be liable for copyright infringement. Just because the AI model does not actually store copies of the works it was trained on does not mean that it isn&#39;t copying the original work when it generates content that is substantially similar to the original work. An AI model can&#39;t be said to have independently created content that is substantially similar to content on which the AI model was trained. However, if an AI model generates content that is substantially similar to an original work of a human author and the developer/owner of the AI model could demonstrate that the AI model had not been trained on, and did not have access to, that original work (such as in the case of an original work created after the cut-off training date for the AI model--and assuming the AI model was not able to access the original work on the Internet).
