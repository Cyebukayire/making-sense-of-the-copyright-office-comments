AI art NEEDS to be regulated. There is absolutely no question about this.<br/>AI is incapable of having a human imagination. Where humans take inspiration from other artworks but ultimately make it their own, AI simply copies.<br/>This means that every day, hundreds of thousands of artists work, including minors and people unconsenting, is fed into AI generators. This art is then stolen and copied so the AI can produce &quot;original&quot; art by simply stealing. <br/>You are not an artist if you use AI. AI is not creating art out of thin air. This is stealing, plain and simple.<br/>Regulate AI art, especially in professional settings. Artist&#39;s work is being stolen from them, used to make a profit, and they don&#39;t get any of it. Again, many of these artists work for freelance, or are simply MINORS and young adults doing this for fun. Many of these artists do it for a living as well.<br/>I&#39;m sick and tired of AI bros pretending AI is real art. It&#39;s stealing, plain and simple. You can use AI tools in a better way, however, with regulations set in place. This is on you now. Are you going to protect artists against copyright, or let this theft continue?
