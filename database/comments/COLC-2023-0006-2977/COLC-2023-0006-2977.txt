Content and creative works &quot;generated&quot; by artificial intelligence systems should not be eligible for copyright protection. These systems are essentially plagiarism machines. The only way they are capable of generating anything is by stealing (crawling, scraping, etc) content and creative works that were created by human beings. Additionally, they are doing this without permission, attribution, or compensation. The overseers of such systems falsely call this &quot;learning.&quot;
