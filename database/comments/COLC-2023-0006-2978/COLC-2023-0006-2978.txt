My opinion on this issue is that either copyright should not apply to anything created substantially by an artificial intelligence or, what I feel is a better option, is that anything generated by an artificial intelligence has its copyright owned by that artificial intelligence (not the individual or company that created the artificial intelligence nor the individual or company which inputted the prompt) and therefore would not be permitted to be shared in any cases outside of fair use. In the second case permission from the artificial intelligence would need to be given only after it has been proven that the artificial intelligence has enough capacity to consent.
