It is my understanding that AI uses already existing works of art from human creators to generate amalgamations and claim it as &quot;art&quot;.<br/><br/>How is this not plagiarism? AI doesn&#39;t create anything new. It doesn&#39;t create at all. It robs the work of others and claims it as its own.<br/><br/>This degrades, demeans, and debases the work, creativity, and efforts of true artists. <br/><br/>How can anyone claim copyright over something they didn&#39;t actually create?
