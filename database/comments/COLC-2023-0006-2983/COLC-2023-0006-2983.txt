AI should be regulated and unable to train on all copyrighted property. Without the addition of a human hand, they are unable to create separate, derivative works as a human artist might when making a work inspired by an existing work or style. They are simply using scraped-off bits of other people&#39;s works to create something similar enough to replace the very same artists, authors, and other creators from which they scrape data. Like many such laws, allowing AI to be trained on copyrighted data will disproportionately affect small creators. Whereas a large company, such as Disney, or a wealthy author backed by a major publishing house can afford the time, effort, and lawyers to track down stolen intellectual property (IP), smaller creators have no such recourse. That makes it incredibly simple for one AI to put hundreds or even thousands of small creators out of work, depending on the scale of the AI, its learning models, and its use.<br/><br/>AI-created material should also not be eligible for a copyright claim. Generally, a copyright would belong to the person(s) who created the material, the company for whom the creator(s) worked, or an entity to which copyright claims have been sold. However, as an AI is merely mixing up the pieces it has gleaned from other sources without truly &quot;creating&quot; anything, it cannot be held as the creator without also crediting the works and creators from which it learned, an impossible task. Therefore, as an AI has no true originality, neither it nor the company that created or owns it can claim true authorship of the work. Without authorship, there can be no copyright claim. Without authorship, there can also be no ownership, and rights to the work cannot be sold to another entity for copyright purposes.<br/><br/>Both the companies/individuals that train AI and those that own an AI system should be held responsible for ensuring their AI does not train on copyrighted material. They are therefore liable if their AI (or the learning models that make up the AI&#39;s bank of intellectual resource) scrapes and/or uses elements of a copyrighted work.<br/><br/>Without regulation, AI hurts small creators and has the potential to put them out of a job with no recourse for reclaiming stolen intellectual property. It&#39;s vital to impose regulations and restrictions on AI to prevent it from harming the livelihoods of those it scrapes data from.
