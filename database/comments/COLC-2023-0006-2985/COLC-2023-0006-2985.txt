Under what circumstances would the unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train AI models constitute fair use? It would constitute as fair use if AI programs were using datasets and/or the programs for scientific study purposes. As an experiment or a test, and the image generating programs would NOT be released to the public (not monetized for sure) and the datasets including all the unauthorized data destroyed. <br/><br/>The use of copyrighted materials in a training dataset or to train generative AI models may be done for noncommercial or research purposes. How should the fair use analysis apply if AI models or datasets are later adapted for use of a commercial nature? If Ai programs want to become commercial they must delete their datasets and use only data that was provided to them with consent. Eg, they must create a new dataset with the data sourced with authors consent. Authors must submit their work themselves if they wish to participate. <br/>What quantity of training materials do developers of generative AI models use for training? Does the volume of material used to train an AI model affect the fair use analysis? If so, how?  The quantity does not matter, it doesn&#39;t not erase the fact that training materials were taken without consent. And strangers are training the AI with unauthorized works as we speak. That data will remain in the program. The fact is, the AI would never be at the level it is currently if not for the unauthorized works taken, they are permanently in the system and therefore committing copyright infringement every time someone uses AI. <br/><br/> Is it possible for an AI model to &lsquo;&lsquo;unlearn&rsquo;&rsquo; inferences it gained from training on a particular piece of training material? If so, is it economically feasible? In addition to retraining a model, are there other ways to &lsquo;&lsquo;unlearn&rsquo;&rsquo; inferences from training?  As much as i know, there are no ways to unlearn anything. There are thousands of artworks with every taken style and material created every minute.<br/>Does the increasing use or distribution of AI-generated material raise any unique issues for your sector or industry as compared to other copyright stakeholders? Yes, it takes away jobs and reduces the quality of work. In China there are already companies reducing artists and replacing them with AI.

See source at the start. <br/><br/> In order to allow copyright owners to determine whether their works have been used, should developers of AI models be required to collect, retain, and disclose records regarding the materials used to train their models? Should creators of training datasets have a similar obligation? Yes and yes to both. <br/><br/>Is legal protection for AI-generated material desirable as a policy matter? Is legal protection for AI-generated material necessary to encourage development of generative AI technologies and systems? Does existing copyright protection for computer code that operates a generative AI system provide sufficient incentives? There should never be any AI generated copyrighted works. Copyright should be reserved to human authors who do possess the skills to make a product.<br/><br/>What obligations, if any, should there be to notify copyright owners that their works have been used to train an AI model? There should be attempts to contact the copyright owners with the option for their work to be deleted from the dataset and no longer used. <br/><br/>Should copyright owners have to affirmatively consent (opt in) to the use of their works for training materials, or should they be provided with the means to object (opt out)? There should ne a system for people to opt in and all works to be considered &quot;opt out&quot; by default. There are plenty of authors who may be behind a language barrier, no longer online or deceased (with their works still on the internet) and they should be protected by an automatic opt out policy. <br/><br/>
