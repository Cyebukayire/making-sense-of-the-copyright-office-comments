1)How AI models should use copyrighted data in training?<br/><br/>AI models should train on copyrighted data only with a directed permission of the IP owner. On social media should be gave to all users the possibility to not give the authorization to use the material that users produce to train AI models. Also, the &quot;Not consent to use my IP on this to train AI models&quot; should be the default switch, to prevent that many IP made by social media users would be used for training, only because they are not aware that the site collects data for AI training.<br/><br/>Also Types of Copyright like Common Creative, should leave the chance to the owner to declare that his work can be used by a human, but not for AI training.<br/><br/>2) Whether AI-generated material can be copyrighted even without a human involved?<br/><br/>AI generated material should not be copyrightable. On work made by a machine and a human, should be copyrightable only the part made by the human, if it is possible to separate them. If this is impossible, the content should be not be copyrightable.<br/><br/>3) How copyright liability would work with AI?<br/><br/>Train AI models with copyright material, without consent of the author or detain the IP, should be considered as a copyright infringement. Also, the case of AIs accessible to all, should be made this rule, in order to prevent it. Commercial companies should have a log with all material used for AI training. Also, people who use an image for train an AI should be responsible to control that the person who give the permission to use his content, is really the owner of the content.<br/><br/>AI images should not be copyrightable and who trains an AI with copyrighted material without permission should be classified as someone that is infracting copyright. The responsibility, in the case of the usage of AI that can be trained by anyone, like stable diffusion, should be of the person who trains the AI and of the organization who has made the AI models that he uses to train (since the organization should programs the AI in order to avoid not authorized training).<br/><br/>4) AI on publicity.<br/><br/>Workers on publicity should be protected, in order to avoid a replacement of workers. AI should be only a help. Also, AI should not be used to make personalized spot to costumers, since it would be a manipulative usage of this technology.<br/>
