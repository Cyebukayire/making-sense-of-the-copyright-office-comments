AI presents a clear and present danger to Americans in any industry where digital technology is used to create. We&#39;ve already seen movie studios trying to pay extras one day&#39;s wage for the rights to their image in perpetuity. This practice is horrific and threatens to put an end to the job of movie extra; why would a studio pay actual people to come and be in the background when they can edit in an AI - animated copy of a person for pennies on the dollar? Moreover, any job requiring visual art or written media is in danger as companies send their AIs to scrape any and all content they can find on the internet. The lack of ability to copyright this material helps, but this could be repealed at any time, and I&#39;m certain that a loophole could be found to continue this theft and exploitation. <br/>Workers are already struggling to live across America. If left unregulated, AI is going to push more people out of work and into poverty. The use of AI to create content needs to be heavily regulated, if not outright banned, to protect these workers.
