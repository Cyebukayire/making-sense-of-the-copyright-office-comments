Greetings:<br/><br/>My name is Joel Mathis. I am a freelance writer, a status I&#39;ve held to greater and lesser extents since 2010. My work appears regularly at the Kansas City Star, The Week magazine website, and the National Geographic website. Earlier in my career, I wrote for Macworld -- in fact, it is where I began my freelance career. I am grateful to the folks there for giving me a start.<br/><br/>I have become aware that Macworld has created its own AI chatbot, built on its archives -- archives that include my work. In essence, my work has been used to train the machines that could replace me. I was not aware of this possibility while writing for Macworld.<br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/23844868/ai-chatbot-macworld-pcworld-journalism-smart-answers<br/><br/>I have no advice to give on regulating such matters. But compensation and notification to writers who might be training their robot replacements might be a good start.
