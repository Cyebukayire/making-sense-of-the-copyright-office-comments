I think that anyone training an AI should need permission from the copyright holder of the set they wish to use in order to do so. To use someone&rsquo;s art without their permission for this is theft, especially considering it&rsquo;s for a process that will attempt to mimic their work. It&rsquo;s plagiarism, plain and simple. Works created by AI should not be able to be copyrighted either as nothing in them is original to the AI system. Every little thing it uses is taken from a human artist that will not be receiving credit for their work. If a studio pays an artist to use their work to train an AI, then the copyright to any works created by that AI are is still largely with the original artist.  Allowing AI created works to be copyrighted would encourage animation, CGI, etc based studios to continue to underpay their employees and cut as much human involvement from the process as possible in order to avoid paying the money for human artists/workers.
