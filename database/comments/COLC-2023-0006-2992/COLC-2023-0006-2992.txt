It is inappropriate and should be considered a violation of copyright to train AI on any published work (published anywhere, including self-published, personal blogs, and social media) without the express permission of the author. This is because their work is then used, even if recycled with other content, in whatever automatically generated content the AI produces. It is especially problematic and a violation of copyright if that AI work is then sold for money. Furthermore, AI writing should not be subject to copyright the same way original work is. Writing that is wholly generated by AI is a mishmash of other people&#39;s hard work. Extremely minimal effort goes into AI writing--you simply have to put in a few words as a prompt. The result of that prompt is not an original work. Those publishing AI-generated work and selling it for a monetary value should be required to disclose that the piece is AI-generated. Consumers have a right to know whether they&#39;re paying for something that was generated by a computer using potentially stolen work from real creators. Using AI as a writing support tool to generate synonyms, writing prompts, etc is not a problem. But works generated wholly or mostly by AI are not a creative piece of original writing, and any copyright should belong to the people whose works the AI was trained on, not the prompter.
