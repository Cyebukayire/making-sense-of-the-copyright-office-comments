The predictive algorithms misnamed &#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39; must be much more strictly regulated than they at present are: the bodies of text upon which they operate have been assembled from the copyrighted work of hundreds of thousands of real writers and artists, without permission or compensation, and their outputs even now are being used to replace those same writers&#39; and artists&#39; labor. The results are disastrous in terms of quality of available information, as well, as these algorithms have no ability to understand whether the things they say are correct, merely whether the things they say are &#39;the kind of a thing an actual human might be likely to say&#39; for any reason. The policy that AI-derived works cannot be copyrighted is sound, but does not go far enough: any company operating such an AI must be required to prove that every part of the corpus of its training data is being used with the knowledge and permission of the rights holder and that fair royalties are being paid for it.
