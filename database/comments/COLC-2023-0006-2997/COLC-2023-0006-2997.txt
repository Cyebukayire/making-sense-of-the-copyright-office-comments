Hello, I am illustration student and freelance artist with hopes of pursing work in the animation or comics industries. I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods of artists. There are already strikes happening in response to industries using AI that will take jobs and money of hard working artists and writers.  AI is making the fiture of all artists, including mine, far more uncertain then its evee been. Its taken away freelance cliential, taking away a jobs within the industry all while using a dataset built off the work of the same  artists and writers it threaten jobs. The dataset that GenAI uses already disregards the copyright of thousands of artist when the creators and programs scrapped the internet. No artist or weritter could of ever consented to their work being used in such a way and there is no ethical way for these datasets with their current source can be used without disregarding the copyright of thousands. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
