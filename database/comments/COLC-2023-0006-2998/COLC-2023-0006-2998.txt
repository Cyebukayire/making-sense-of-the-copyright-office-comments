I am an artist, and I don&rsquo;t appreciate or approve of my work being used in Ai algorithms and learning programs without my consent. I also fear that the popularization of Ai will lead to many, perhaps the majority of jobs in my field, to no longer exist, if protections are not put in place. Do we want to live in a world where humans are no longer making commercial art? I do not. Without proper checks, Artificial Intelligence will continue to steal without impunity from artists and destroy our livelihoods. Not to mention the ease at which Ai can trick someone with an untrained eye or ear to believe Joe Biden gave an order to &ldquo;kill all puppies&rdquo; or something or that nature. At its worst Ai deepfakes could be threats to national security. And it&rsquo;s not as if the people who&rsquo;s likenesses are used in these videos gave their consent either. As a tool it is not inherently evil, but it is being used without focus to the ends of those with no oversight. So I am against it, and I hope you will do something to help those who Ai hurts the most. Thank you.
