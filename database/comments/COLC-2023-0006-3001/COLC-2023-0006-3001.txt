I believe that artificial intelligences should be require to obtain explicit permission from all sources used to construct them. Tech companies have already made it harder for those who create copyrightable material to maintain control over their work enabling viral sharing without attribution or pay and implementing frameworks that incorrectly flag things as copyright violations, or correctly flag them on behalf of the wrong people. I don&#39;t believe that tech companies creating AI can be trusted to not make this situation worse with AI. It will undoubtably turn into a way for large companies to launder the copyrightable works created by other people. I also do not believe that AI works should be themselves copyrightable, particularly if the producers of the AI can not affirmatively show they had rights to the content feed into the AI. AI should be used as a tool to assist human in creating copyrightable works not a system that can itself create copyrightable works and if adobe was distributing assets that they didn&#39;t explicitly have rights to as part of their software suite it would undoubtably be a problem it should be the same for AI.
