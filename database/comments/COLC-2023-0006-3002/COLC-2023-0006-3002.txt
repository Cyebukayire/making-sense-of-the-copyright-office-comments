I believe we should uphold the idea that only humans can create copyrightable art. Not only is opening up copyright to AI a danger to the livelihood of artists, but it also runs the risk of granting copyright to owners of &quot;painting animals&quot; and other such attractions. That&#39;s just asking for PETA to get involved again, and that&#39;s the last thing we need. AI &quot;art&quot; also has a precedent of stealing art from online artists without credit or permission. Allowing AI art to be copyrighted would effectively be stealing the copyright from original artists and granting it to programmers or users of the program. Again, lawsuits abound under these circumstances. It would save everyone a lot of time and legal funds to just keep the policy as it is.
