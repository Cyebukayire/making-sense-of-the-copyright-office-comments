I am a writer and I strongly believe my craft is under threat from an unregulated plagiarism machine. That is what AI is at the moment. It is regurgitates content it found on the internet with no concern over copyright, intellectual rights, real creativity, etc. AI must be regulated as it is already being used by industries to make art and to write despite the fact the algorithm actively is ripping off countless artists and writers who do not see a penny for their hard work.
