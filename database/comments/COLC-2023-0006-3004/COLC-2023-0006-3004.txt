I appreciate that this topic as been opened up for discussion, since it&#39;s been a very hot topic in a lot of circles I frequent online. As someone who engages with and supports artists and writers online, and as an artist and writer myself, I think it&#39;s important for artists and authors to be asked permission before having their work be included in &quot;AI&quot; training sets. As the creators of those works, they have the right to maintain their intellectual property and should be allowed to say &quot;no, I don&#39;t want you using my work to generate content that cuts me out of the creative process.&quot; Many artists I know are concerned about their income being affected by someone who can just type their name into an &quot;AI&quot; site to generate an image that looks like their work but isn&#39;t. It also has the potential to harm creators&#39; reputations if the content generared looks similar to their work but is sub-par or even hateful when they would never create something like that in real life. It&#39;s imperative for the well-being of creatives everywhere that they are asked (and grant!) permission before their art is added to training sets.<br/>In terms of whether &quot;AI&quot; content should be copyrightable, I don&#39;t think it should. At least not without significant human editing/input. Anyone could type a prompt into a generator and have the odds of creating the same image. It&#39;s luck of the draw, and the line of who should have ownership of the content provided is so blurred as to be nearly impossible to differentiate. Should an &quot;AI&quot; image belong to the person who typed the prompts? Or should it belong to the creator(s) who created the art that trained the generator? Or should it go to the engineer who created the generator in the first place? There are too many complicating factors and too little human touch in my opinion.<br/>Overall, it&#39;s a very slippery slope that I believe will lead to undercompensation (or no compensation at all) for people who have put a great deal of time and effort into their work. &quot;AI&quot; content should be mandated to ask permission from creators before using their work for training and the content produced by these generators should not be copyrightable.<br/>Thank you for your time and consideration for this topic. The well-being of creators is very important to me.
