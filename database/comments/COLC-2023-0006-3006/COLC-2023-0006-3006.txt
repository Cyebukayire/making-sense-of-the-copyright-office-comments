Many digital platforms are now using authors work to train their AI. Even Microsoft Word&#39;s latest user agreement allows them to use content in Word. Authors&#39;s work should never be used without permission. If authors&#39; work is used to train AI to write, then authors should be compensated. Taking an author&#39;s style and plugging it into an AI algorithm is a copyright infringement.
