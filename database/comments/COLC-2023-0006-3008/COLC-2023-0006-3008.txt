I&rsquo;m honestly not a big fan of A.I. In theory, it can be used in tandem with the artist to create a faster and better product. But the it is being used now is exploitative and robbing people of jobs, making work go faster but the end result much sloppier. It should be a tool, not a replacement. And the people using A.I don&rsquo;t seem to understand that nor value the creative process.
