I am writing to express my concerns regarding potential changes to copyright law that may restrict access to data used for AI training. As a volunteer contributor to open source machine learning projects like Open Assistant and WizardCoder, I believe limiting access to data in this way could have profoundly negative implications. <br/><br/>Current practices of training AI models using freely available public data have opened up opportunities for researchers, startups, and open source communities. Imposing licensing requirements or other restrictions on this data risks consolidating power among a few large tech firms who can afford the costs, while blocking smaller players and non-profits from the field.<br/><br/>As an open source developer, I have personally experienced the value of open data in empowering and enabling broader participation in AI research and development. But restrictive laws may end up building walls around data that could better serve the public good if available.<br/><br/>We should be wary of changes to copyright motivated by lobbying from big tech and rights holders. While they may argue this protects content, in practice it often serves to help big players exploit their advantages. This could allow companies like Adobe or stock photo providers to dominate AI applications built on artistic works. <br/><br/>Let us avoid the legal &quot;moats&quot; and monopolies that would arise from limiting training data. Instead of shutting out small players, new laws should promote transparency, accountability, and openness. Dystopias arise from concentrations of unchecked power; democracy suffers when a few control access to emerging technologies.<br/><br/>AI has flourished thanks to open data policies. Let us not stifle future advances by restricting who can participate. I hope these concerns over potential impacts on decentralization, innovation and access help inform wise policymaking. Please consider the far-reaching implications for the broader public as you navigate this complex issue.
