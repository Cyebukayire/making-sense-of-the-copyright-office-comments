As a writer I worry about my work being used by AI without my knowledge. Why should anything be excluded from copyright law just because it is a new technology? When authors reference another work, it has to be cited. Why is it assumed that AI is excluded from this even though it is essentially a work of writing itself, code written and maintained by humans. Therefore if it is using other people&#39;s work to improve itself, as a wikipedia article might cite it&#39;s sources, then it must make clear that it is either using copyrighted material for profit or not.
