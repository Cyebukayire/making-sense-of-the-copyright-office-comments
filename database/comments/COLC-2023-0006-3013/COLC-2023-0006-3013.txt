Protection of people&#39;s livelyhood against AI must come in several parts:<br/><br/>Reproduction of biometrics and features<br/>Right now we have companies like Disney using artist&#39;s likeness, like in Star Wars, with Governor Tarken and Princess Leia, after their death and sometimes without their involvement at all on a project. Now companies are trying to take actors&#39; likenesses and pay them for a day&#39;s work and use it for the entire rest of the project, animated by an ununionized 3d animation teams, which is what the actor&#39;s union is fighting about. We need protections against over-reaching corporations that allow people to have a balanced fight against predatory contracts that use their likeness for little pay.<br/><br/>Ethical use of training sources from artists work<br/>Right now, few machine learning algorithms can boast being created on datasets where clear consent was given to use the data given to train an AI on. ChatGPT, Dalle2, and Google&#39;s AI, to name a few, are in seriously murky water as to the rights to use them as source material. Our rights must be protected as creators of work that goes on to be used as it&#39;s own entity, as though our thoughts and styles didn&#39;t make up that entirely.<br/><br/>Loss of industry to automation<br/>It&#39;s widely believed that eventually, all meaningful jobs will be lost to automation. What will that look like for common people. What will that look like for non-owners? How will we eat? These are problems that must be tackled before AI leads to massive job loss. There are already industries where business people believe AI can complete professional quality work.
