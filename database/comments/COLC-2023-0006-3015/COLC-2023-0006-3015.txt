&quot;AI&quot; in its current form is nothing but automated plagiarism, &quot;creating&quot; content off the backs of thousands of uncompensated creators who have had their work included in either the text or image database used by &quot;AI&quot; engines learning base. Being able to use individual, living artists&#39; names and have an image created by AI that utilizes pieces of those artists&#39; works is nothing but crude copyright violation. Until corporations behind these engines -- Adobe, IBM, ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc. -- compensate the creators whose work they require in order for their product to work competently, AI content should not be rewarded copyright. In fact, these corporations should be regulated to the extent that they MUST compensate every creator whose work has been scraped and uploaded to the database upon which their product relies. AI is a powerful tool but should not be  monetized at the expense of thousands of creators who have had their own copyrights violated.
