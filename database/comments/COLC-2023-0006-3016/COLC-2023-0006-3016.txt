My name is Stefan Gagne, owner of Fiction Factory Games LLC, and a citizen of Maryland. <br/><br/>I work in an industry potentially under threat by A.I. generated content -- video game development. The threat is twofold; the use of cheap A.I. generated content to replace artists, writers, programmers, and musicians. Also the threat of our own art, writing, programming, and music (all of which is copyrighted) being used to train an A.I. which can then generate content similar to ours and sell it cheaply.<br/><br/>A.I. models are being trained on copyrighted material regularly, with no opt-in, no choice, no consent given to have our work repurposed and remixed and re-sold commercially. Because millions of creators are having their work stolen in this manner it becomes difficult if not impossible to point to any one portion of an A.I. generated work and say &quot;that&#39;s copying my work.&quot; This is not similar to how a human takes inspiration from another&#39;s work -- most A.I. models literally could not exist without stolen assets.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t believe A.I. technology is innately problematic. If trained on a legal set of materials, such as writing that has been commissioned expressly for purposes of training the model, then it can be a very powerful and beneficial tool. But the current practice of &quot;scraping&quot; the web for anything publicly viewable is wildly unethical -- just because words or images are on the internet doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re free from copyright, a fact these systems completely ignore, vacuuming them all up into their models without attribution and without checking legality.<br/><br/>Regarding the issue of whether or not A.I. generated content can be copyrighted, I don&#39;t feel it can be unless the model is proven to use 100% ethically sourced and copyright-safe materials. Without that, the resulting output invariably is using illegally obtained material and cannot be considered a derivative work as no intentional and consensual human creativity went into its making. The issue is the obvious loophole -- if A.I. content is not copyrightable, all someone has to do is generate content, then adjust it very slightly by changing a word here and there or doing minor editing, and now it&#39;s arguably copyrightable. This trivial effort to skirt around the law is difficult to deal with and honestly I don&#39;t have a solution, as I am not a lawyer. But I hope for the sake of millions of artists who are harmed by unrestrained use of A.I. that an answer can be found.<br/><br/>I&#39;d like to close out this comment with a warning -- because A.I. is capable of generation hundreds, thousands, even millions of similar but unique texts, there&#39;s a strong worry this very comment submission process will be flooded by A.I. advocates using A.I. itself to create pro-A.I. submissions under fake names. I hope you&#39;re prepared for the potential tidal wave of misinformation that will come with opening this public inquiry.<br/><br/>Please do the right thing. Rule against the violation of copyright inherent in most A.I. models. As human artists we do not consent to have our work repurposed and copyright-claimed by others. Please stop this before it results in the collapse of our nation&#39;s creative enterprises. Thank you for your time.
