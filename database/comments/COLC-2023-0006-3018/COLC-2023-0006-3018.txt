I am a writer based in Virginia. Artificial intelligence currently represents a significant threat to my livelihood and those of other creatives because of its unregulated scraping of our material. We have no opportunity to opt in or out of having our material scraped, and we see no compensation for what amounts to a copyright violation. Attempts by companies to replace the work of human beings with AI represent further threats to our livelihoods, particularly and most egregiously with attempts to scan the bodies and voices of actors to use with no compensation. Technological innovation should not come at the price of destroying protections for copyright holders and working creatives.
