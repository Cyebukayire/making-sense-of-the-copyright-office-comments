Regarding Artificial Intelligence and Copyright, I encourage you to consider the following as you draft policy. Historically, &quot;scraping&quot; of content on the internet to analyze and index them in an effort to generate new non-infringing content has been considered fair-use. Rather than crafting a policy that might change that interpretation (and thus have unintended consequences for researches and academics who regularly perform such activities), I encoruage you to look to things like the Creative Commons. By requiring AI generated work to use a Creative Commons license (particularly for open source or non-profit related AI work) you help protect the commercial interests of artists and creators while allowing AI generated work to continue to be researched and explored. At the very least, you might consider requiring that AI generated work provide &quot;credits&quot; to the artists/creators work that &quot;inspired&quot; the new AI content. <br/><br/>As you craft this policy, I encourage you to be extremely focused when it comes to the policy&#39;s breadth. Overly broad policy is likely to have many unintended consequences. As the EFF have stated in their article &#39;How we think about copyright and AI art&#39;, &quot;copyright doesn&rsquo;t grant a monopoly on a genre or subject&rsquo;s tropes and motifs, including expressive elements like wavy lines to denote shaking, giving animals more human facial expressions, and similar common&mdash;even if creative&mdash;choices. What&rsquo;s more, copyright does not apply at all to non-creative choices&mdash;like representing a cat as having four legs and a tail. Much of the information stored by and produced by an AI art generator falls into these categories.&quot;<br/><br/>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/how-we-think-about-copyright-and-ai-art-0<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>
