Hello. I am an aspiring author who has also worked as a middle school teacher. Unregulated AI is detrimental to the arts - specifically writing, drawing, animation, voice acting (such as audio books), acting, and singing/music - because people&#39;s copyrights are being infringed upon. People&#39;s works are being used as training devices for AI without their consent, and people&#39;s creative endeavors are being passed over in place of cheap, poorly-made AI alternatives. Further, as per my experience in the education sector, AI has the potential to mislead and misinform students, such as those who rely on ChatGPT for information. Students have begun using this resource as a crutch, one that completes their written assignments for them. Not only does this take away valuable learning and practice from the student, it is a danger for providing inaccurate information that students take at face value. I implore you to consider the dangers of unregulated AI, especially on an education system that has already been in fast decline. Thank you for your time and consideration.
