AI image generation is theft, all art that is used to train the AI was used without consent and without compensation to the artists. Artists already have it extremely hard in this world, now it has gotten even harder. I used to have a waiting list, now I have to almost beg people to purchase my art.<br/>AI should be helping everyone, not exploiting everyone.<br/><br/>--------------<br/><br/>Facts:<br/><br/>- AI image generation is a tool. The data has been illegally been collected (even my art was used to train it). <br/>- AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; is plagiarism. AI image generation should be properly monitored and needs strict laws.<br/>- It&rsquo;s here now and we can&rsquo;t pretend it is not.<br/><br/>I do NOT support the commercial exploit of AI image generation (both prompters and the companies behind it) due to the illegal way the algorithm has been trained.<br/><br/>    AI image generation is not art*. You are NOT an AI artist.<br/><br/>    The concept of &ldquo;AI art&rdquo; has no place in the art community.<br/><br/>    Using AI image generation can be enjoyable for personal use in your own time and space.<br/><br/>    AI image generation can be a great tool for inspiration and reference. (Ideas for themes, poses, backgrounds, compositions, alternatives&hellip;)<br/><br/>*To me, the exported images from these algorithms are not art. (Some people will argue otherwise)<br/> &ldquo;Art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination&rdquo;. <br/><br/>AI image generation is not creativity, it is stolen creativity put together by an algorithm, and therefore not art in this specific scenario.<br/><br/>In fact, &ldquo;AI art&rdquo; is not even &ldquo;AI&rdquo; at all, as it is an algorithm and not artificial intelligence. (Based on TBSkyen)<br/><br/>I used to be excited about the development of AI image generation! I thought; finally I get a tool that might help me fix my terrible perspective issues, or, finally I can create alternate versions of my favourite cat memes. It was great trying it and I loved seeing what it could do, I naively only thought about how it could help us grow as artists. It still can, just not this way.<br/>Unfortunately I can genuinely feel my passion for art being swallowed by melancholy and my desire to draw drop steadily, as the more I see our precious art platforms get swamped by these so called &ldquo;AI artists&rdquo;, littering mine and other people&rsquo;s feed with their endless soulless images. Every time I lift my pen I catch myself thinking &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point&rdquo;. I know, I know I should not let myself succumb to those thoughts, but the human mind does these things.<br/>
