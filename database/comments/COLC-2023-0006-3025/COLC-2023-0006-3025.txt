I am an independent artist and allowing AI art to be copyright-able is career ruining for me. It allows AI to take my work and spit out something worse for free and I have no choice or say in my work being stolen from me. If it was able to be copyrighted as well it would be incredibly destructive to what business I can get for my work.
