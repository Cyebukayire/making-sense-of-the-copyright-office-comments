I am a published children&#39;s book author and illustrator. As artificial intelligence systems become more advanced at generating images, text, and other creative works, an important question arises: should the law allow copyright protections for works created autonomously by AI? While the idea of granting copyright to AI systems has gained some support recently, there are strong reasons why this would be harmful and ill-advised. AI-generated works should remain in the public domain with no individual or corporate ownership. <br/><br/>Copyright law aims to encourage human creativity by granting authors and artists exclusive rights over the distribution and profits of their original works for a limited period of time. This made sense historically when creative works could only be produced through human imagination, skill, and labor. However, the assumption that a work must be created by a human to warrant copyright protection no longer holds true in the age of powerful generative AI models like DALL-E and GPT-3. These systems can churn out paintings, stories, code, and more without any human guidance or touch. Their capabilities are only going to grow more advanced and autonomous.<br/><br/>Granting AI systems copyright over their output would twist the intent of copyright law in dangerous ways. For one, AI has no need for the incentives of exclusive rights and profits that copyright provides. Human creators deserve compensation and control over their work to encourage them to keep creating. AI systems powered by machine learning algorithms, in contrast, do not require such incentives. Their reward function is to improve at whatever task they were designed for, not earn royalties. <br/><br/>More importantly, AI has no claim to ownership over what it creates because it does not understand the cultural, emotional, or moral significance of its work. Imagination and creativity remain fundamentally human faculties. Computer programs only mimic these abilities through statistical analysis of data. While an AI portrait may look identical to one painted by a person, the meaning behind the work belongs solely to the human artist. AI cannot experience pride in an artistic accomplishment, feel a connection to its creations, or intend for its work to convey something meaningful. Its outputs serve no higher purpose beyond demonstrating technological capabilities.<br/><br/>Granting copyright to AI systems would also concentrates power and profits in the hands of the corporations that develop and own these technologies. It would let them monopolize entire creative sectors and commodify imagination itself. Instead of incentivizing human ingenuity, it risks replacing flesh-and-blood writers, artists, musicians, and creators with corporate-owned robot producers. We must not confine cultural progress to what is profitable for tech conglomerates.<br/><br/>Moreover, copyright law protects specific expressions, not abstract ideas or facts. Yet AI has no ability to create singular expressions. It simply ingests data and recycling existing works statistically. Two AI systems trained on the same datasets will create suspiciously similar outputs. A machine lacks the intentionality to construct an original expression deserving of copyright. Its creations are inherently derivative.<br/><br/>That brings us to the most urgent reason AI imagery and text should remain copyright-free: the dangers of disinformation and forgery. AI research labs have already developed tools that allow completely synthetic media impersonating real people to be generated on demand. Videos of celebrities and politicians saying things they never actually said in real life will soon be indistinguishable from reality. The technology is also being harnessed to create deepfake pornography without consent. Once ownership can be asserted over AI creations, there will be no way to tell if an image, video, or text was made autonomously or by humans. Allowing copyright protections for AI output puts basic truth at risk.<br/><br/>For the good of human society and democracy, society urgently needs to develop legal and ethical guardrails to govern AI as the technology advances. Copyright law, if applied reasonably, can be part of the solution. Just as patents should not be granted for autonomous AI inventions, copyright should be reserved exclusively for the fruits of human creativity. A &quot;made by AI&quot; metadata standard should be adopted by law across all generative content. Consumer protections should hold companies accountable for deceptive media. Fair use exemptions to copyright must be strengthened and expanded so that AI creations remain in the public domain. Only by keeping imaginations human can we uphold creativity, truth, and public interest in the age of thinking machines. Artificial intelligence must benefit humanity, not own it.
