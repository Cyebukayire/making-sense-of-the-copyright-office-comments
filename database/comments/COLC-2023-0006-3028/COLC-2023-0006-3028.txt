Because the work by Artificial Intelligence can not accurately be called human-made work, it should not fall under copyright. Unless we get to a point where we consider AI as equivalent to humans, all it is is a program that can act as a support for those wanting to produce something, but not completely have an understanding of how to produce it themselves, in a sense representing a model to utilize. While at a University level or a high school level it would be considered academically dishonest to utilize something that is not your own work, outside of this there should be no reason to prevent people from utilizing this tool or even striking down the work as copyright. To get onto the point that these AI models use copyrighted work to base their creations off of, you could equate this sort of thing to the way that a musician may cover a song by another band, or use its beats to produce their own. Or alternatively an author who draws inspiration in a plot from another book they have read, which in effect could kick off the creation of genres. AI doing this is not really different, because we all learn from copyrighted material in what we consume on a day-to-day basis, and an AI model using this to produce their own work is arguably no different. While concern can be made in regards to the increasing use of it on an academic level, that is more of an issue within the academic field than what should be regulated federally.<br/>Now to address some of the general questions:<br/>1. The benefits of this technology is that it can lead to a creative bloom, and can help facilitate more expression in mediums that can be difficult to enter, but a risk to this system would be caused from the overutilization, and reliance upon this system that people may develop. To address this second part, I would argue that it is effecting these group in a similar manner that any new technology would challenge the existing systems.<br/>4. I would not know any specific laws to answer this first part, but to address the second part, there should be some degree of uniformity across countries of a similar system. If anything, we should potentially look at models that our allies utilize, such as the EU countries, Canada, Mexico, and not to countries that are more outright hostile to free speech, like the PRC, Russia, or Saudi Arabia.<br/>5. Any regulation should be within academic bounds, otherwise, not necessary. Perhaps a regulation on the utilization of a single source, and a requirement to use a certain amount of sources to prevent explicit copying<br/>8. It is my belief that training AI with copyrighted material is equivalent to a human being trained with copyrighted material to develop their own original material, it is no different, and should be considered fair use.<br/>9. No, all material should be fair game.<br/>12. Arguably there is an extent, at least in art, you can tell if the source takes inspiration from a certain artist, such as the orientation of characters in a background, or even the design of a place, but it isn&#39;t always the case, and depends on the model.<br/>13. The economic impacts would probably be more initially a problem, but would resolve themselves like any new technology has.<br/>14. The minimum amount of sources the AI draws upon is all I think is an issue.<br/>15. Yes, there should be a publicly available record to see who they draw their training upon, as well as trainers of the datasets. It should be disclosed what percent of their training came from an individual source, copyrighted or not, and which ones were utilized.<br/>16. A notification through email upon the release of the AI program, or other means of reaching out to the authors to notify, so long as the percentage is above 5% of total training<br/>18. The only circumstances that a copyright can be applicable to a human in this case should be if the work has mixed AI and human elements, where the human elements are free to be copyrighted, but not the AI elements<br/>20. There should be legal protections to AI models in the sense that the models should be allowed to operate without a selfish creator trying to strike down the program or otherwise defame it.<br/>25. The developer of the system, those who utilize it should come with the understanding that it falls under fair use, and any deviation from the trainer should be where the fault is layed<br/>28. Wherever it is published, there should be a note that it is AI-generated.<br/>30. There should be protections so long as it does not defame the person it is imitating, such as having the person say slurs through the program.
