I strongly believe that AI generated material should not be copyrightable and that we need stronger laws to prevent AI programs from using human made content for training or replication. Artists already struggle enough without having to worry about protecting their work or losing their jobs to a computer program. Art is the lifeblood of society and the current AI programs are a grotesque parody. We need to nip it in the bud now to prevent it from becoming worse in the future.
