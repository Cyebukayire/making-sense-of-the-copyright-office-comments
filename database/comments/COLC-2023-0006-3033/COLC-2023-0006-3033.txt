I am an amateur creative writer who posts my stories online. It has come to my attention that the space where I post my works is combed for content to teach AI, without request for my or anyone else&#39;s permission. My words, the products of my mind, are being used without my consent. There are likely pieces that are produced using AI taught by studying my patterns that I have no knowledge of. To me, this is appalling. I believe creatives need protections put into place to preserve their pursuits and properties. Art is integral to the identity of humanity, and if artists aren&#39;t protected from being pushed out of their own spaces by AI, then culture so suffer. I also believe that, as AI bots are not individuals, they cannot be credited as the creator of the works they produce, as they are essentially cannibalizing the works of others in order to produce an amalgamation of ideas, instead of a singular and unique piece
