Works created by or with the significant aid of &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; tools such as large language models should not be granted copyright status. Simply put, these tools only exist by exploiting the creative and copyright protected work of artists and writers. This exploitation is frequently performed without any compensation or notice to the copyright holder, to say nothing of the copyright holder&#39;s consent. The existence of these tools directly threatens the livelihoods of the individuals whose work was used, without their knowledge or permission, to create said tools. This differs from past examples of automation, such as the creation of new machines or robotic tools which have replaced factory workers, in that those technological developments did not depend directly upon the people who stood to be replaced by them. Without the writers who might lose their jobs to LLMs, LLMs would not exist. This kind of self-stultifying &quot;progress&quot; is in fact nothing of the sort. As more art and writing is created by LLMs, less will be created by humans, undermining the very foundation of the LLMs. It is important to protect the rights of creative workers to the product of their work, and to maintain the vitality of these creative fields by leaving room for real innovation and creativity rather than a recursive, hyper-referential process such as that utilized by LLMs and other &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; tools.<br/><br/>I will note that the presence of a captcha at the end of this submission form suggests the necessary conclusion. An automated submission to this form would not be considered valid, would it? Why then should an automated submission to the marketplace of ideas, whether in arts or letters, be legitimated by the granting of a copyright?
