I&rsquo;m a professional visual artist and every discussion I&rsquo;ve had with my peers on this topic has included the phrase &lsquo;nightmare scenario&rsquo;. Our industry is highly likely to be decimated by this technology, especially if AI &lsquo;art&rsquo; is allowed to be trademarked and/or copyrighted. Commercial artists, especially those who work digitally, will become redundant and no longer able to find work. AI is a useful tool but should not be used to generate finished products. <br/>Also, the technology is straight up stealing from artists. Our works are fed into these programs so that their algorithms can then spit out something that looks like what we create. This is a plagiarism nightmare that exposes the companies who use this technology for finished work to endless litigation. <br/>A technology that purports to achieve d productivity is instead proving to be highly reductive to our society and culture.
