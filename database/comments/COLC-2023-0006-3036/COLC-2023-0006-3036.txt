Thank you for opening comments on this topic. I think that AI has pulled a lot of people&#39;s intellectual property and they haven&#39;t been compensated, which goes against policy. There needs to be a way to track that and stop people from continuing to steal from artists. I also don&#39;t think that using a computer program to generate something in 2 seconds compares to the long hours that painters, animators, songwriters, and many other kinds of artists put in to make their work, so they should not be able to have a copyright. Thank you
