There is no ethical use of AI in the creative industry. This is a simple but irrefutable fact. AI relies only on existing works to rearrange or distort them, but it will not ever be able to add any meaningful artistic expression to a piece. This directly harms those in creative industries who dedicated their lives and resources to developing their skills. Those that use AI with prompts are no more an artist than a person using a search engine to query existing articles is a researcher/journalist. Art, in all forms, must be protected from this abuse or it will suffer irrevocable harm. Artists will be further marginalized and harmed as well by any further legitimacy offered to AI generated creations. I implore you to look at all sides of this situation, at the very real, very important human element that is involved. If we say that creativity is just another commodity that can be subject to automation, then we devalue all art as we have devalued other mass produced products. We are at a critical juncture in human history where we just decide what is more important: humanity or commerce. Do not let the opportunity slip by to make the right choice. Do not let those that already experience massive amounts of privilege in the existing system further stack the cards in their favor. Side with those that need to create because it is in their heart, not those that want to save a buck while reaping the rewards of other&#39;s creativity. Remember that AI cannot create art. It cannot generate new thoughts, ideas, passions, or revelations. To trust our future on a closed system that will never generate something novel is dangerous and reckless. I know this sounds alarmist, but it is also true. Trust in humans, not in a system that has no stake in our future and well-being. Trust artists to make art.
