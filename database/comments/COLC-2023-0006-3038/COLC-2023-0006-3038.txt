Ai has been nothing but resource exhausting. It slows down all search engines, flooding them with Ai generated images and articles that are useless. It steals other people&#39;s legitimate works without permission, chops them up, and regurgitates a tangled mess of stolen ideas. Ai has only made my online experience worse. Ai is unethical, unproductive, and unwanted.
