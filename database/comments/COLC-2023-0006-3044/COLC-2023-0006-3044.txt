Any A.I. that is trained on work not owned by the company or person running the A.I. is using the work for a purpose for which it was not intended. Authors of copywritten materials (like books) being so used should be able to have some recourse against this. It should not be the author&#39;s job to determine if an A.I. has been trained on the author&#39;s work; the A.I. owner should be required to publicly state what materials specifically the A.I. was trained on and should be able to provide proof of permission for any work not their own and not in the public domain. Using work without permission should result in damages awarded to the author to an extent of one half the author&#39;s publishing contracted total amount, or if self-published, equal to two years&#39; sales total as the author claims on their taxes, AND the A.I. owner must stop using the author&#39;s work immediately. If the A.I. owner does not stop using the author&#39;s work, damages should increase to double, and double for each infraction with no damage cap. For use of artwork, including music and performance art, damages should be based on the artist&#39;s evaluation of the value of their art and the court&#39;s determination of the profit the art may be able to generate. In any case, an incarceration time should be an option for the owner of the A.I., and if the owner is a non-human entity, for the owners of the entity jointly and separately. Theft charges should be placed on the owners&#39; personal records. The incarceration and theft records are to counteract the opinion that if the only punishment for an activity is a fine then the activity is allowed for sufficiently wealthy individuals. <br/><br/>Stealing art is never right and should not be allowed. Use without permission is stealing.
