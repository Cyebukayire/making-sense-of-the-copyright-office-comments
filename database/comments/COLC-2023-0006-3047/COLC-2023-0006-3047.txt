I believe AI trained on stolen artworks cannot create anything you can copyright. The only human &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; is the prompt, anything produced from that is the result of theft and random chance. If you clicked your phones auto fill for 20 minutes, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve written something, it means you flipped a fancy coin. Why should people be allowed to profit off of and exclude people based on things they didn&rsquo;t create?
