&quot;Hello, I am a part time writer and full time marketer living in FL and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods of creators. <br/><br/>This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. It&rsquo;s upsetting to see art stolen and people have been able to profit off of this theft while leaving real creators and artists to suffer the consequences.
