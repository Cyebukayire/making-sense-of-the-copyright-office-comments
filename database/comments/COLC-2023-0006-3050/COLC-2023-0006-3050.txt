I am an amateur writer and illustrator hoping to eventually become a professional. To do this I need to prove that my writing and art are unique and authentic, that it can stand out and draw in potential consumers and turn interest in to sales. Unregulated AI will damage my ability to fulfill this vital function of my job. Why pay for something when you can train an AI on the writing and art you prefer and produce a reasonable facsimile for pennies? AI does and will have it&#39;s uses, but those uses must be discovered with consideration of individual creators, both large and small, in mind.
