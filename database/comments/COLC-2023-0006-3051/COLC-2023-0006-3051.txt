&quot;AI&quot; created content should continue to be treated as any other machine created works and continue to be uncopywritable. That the creators call these machine learning algorithms &quot;AI&quot; and uses a larger database of stolen works to train them does not make them fundamentally different from prior ststems. All of the content they produce should be treated as it already has been treated. There is no benefit to society by making their output copywritable, it would only allow them to use stolen works of others to create vast numbers of works they could then lovk down and claim copywright to. Meaning they would be able to compleltely displace in the market the very people who&#39;s works they violated copyright of to create their &quot;AI&quot;.<br/>Furthermore anyone who trains a machine learning algorithm on others works should be required to keep a record of all works so that anyone who wishes to sue them for breach of copywright can easiy search it to confirm if their works were used without due compensation.
