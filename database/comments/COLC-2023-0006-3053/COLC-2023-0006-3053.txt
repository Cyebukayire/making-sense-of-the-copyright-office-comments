Artificial Intelligence is, at this time, a misnomer for the technology in question. We rather have a machine for looking at a set of outputs and, via a type of brute-force application of probability, produce something that fits into that set. Its outputs are wholly derivative of and dependent on the actual creative labor of the people whose work is scraped for its dataset.<br/>Copyright, in part, exists to make sure that the people who produce the art and writing that enriches our culture are capable of making a living. Allowing AI works to be copyrighted and failing to treat the training of AI on copyrighted material as a violation would be a step backward, allowing the actual labor that produces such work to be harvested wholesale for the profit of tech moguls to the exclusion of those who actually produce new material. We&#39;d metaphorically be cooking the golden goose, squashing an entire generation of creative professionals and letting the arts stagnate, so that a fistful of wealthy or well connected tech sector CEO&#39;s can reap a quick harvest off of unpaid workers regurgitated materials.
