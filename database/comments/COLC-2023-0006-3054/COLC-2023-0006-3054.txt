The nature of AI is that it must be trained on existing data. In the academic field, a study that trained a machine learning tool on data obtained without permission would never be acceptable. Why isn&rsquo;t non-academia being treated the same? It is incredibly unethical to use art of any medium without coming to an agreement with the creator first. I do not consent to my personal information from the internet to be used in training ChatGPT. I do not consent to my art being used to train AI &ldquo;art creators.&rdquo; I do not consent to my unfinished works of writing to be &ldquo;finished&rdquo; by an AI word generator. But none of the companies that run these machine learning algorithms are ASKING these questions. I hope an appropriate and severe limit for these algorithms is reached soon so artists can resume our lives in peace and not have our works breached by such a distasteful lack of respect.
