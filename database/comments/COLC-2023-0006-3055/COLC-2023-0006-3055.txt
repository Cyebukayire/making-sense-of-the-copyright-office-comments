As an artist, I have never consented to my writing being used to train AI. As such, my work is being stolen and used for the profit of others, including people who make similar art. I think AI art (generative content) should not be eligible for copyright without *significant* alteration from the individual. I also think artists and writers should be able to give consent for being included in an AI training set, and they should be compensated for it. As is, our art is being stolen, and the ability for artists to survive is being cut down because people are choosing to use stolen art to replace the skill of actual artists (who had their work stolen for this purpose).
