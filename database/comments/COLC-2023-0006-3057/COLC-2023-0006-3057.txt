Regarding the use of Generative AI in writing, music, visual arts and visual effects, I believe we have been much too blindly led by companies and organizations that have put short term profit over long term socioeconomic stability and moral firmness.<br/><br/>The use of &#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39; is nothing new in this digital age, and in reality the technology has simply recently taken advantage of the massive amount of available data and processing power to create Generative Stable Diffusion Algorithms on a novel scale.  As a tool, programs based on Stable Diffusion allow for this generation&#39;s leap forward in accessibility to artistic media.  The issue is how this data has been gathered and how these algorithms are being used.  The existing programs such as Midjourney or ChatGPT scraped data from various locations on the Internet largely without the consent of the original creators.  This created a false narrative of &#39;free data&#39; that directly opposes trademark, copyright and creative commons.<br/><br/>Individuals and companies took and will take advantage of this violation of protections to reduce their reliance on genuine actors, writers and artists.  While the short term economic gain may be apparent, an increased reliance on Generative systems will reduce the amount of available media for those systems to be built upon.  Digital art generative models are already deteriorating due to the flood of AI generated images online.  The cumulative error effect causes new data sets to become worse.  This is and will be true for any use of Generative AI as a tool.<br/><br/>Designating any media created by &#39;artificial intelligence,&#39; by means of a model generated by en-masse data collection, as ineligible for copyright or trademark will preserve the rights and livelihoods of individuals and of companies who work in entertainment and the arts.  Allowing for copyright or trademark of said material will see the stagnation of culture as a whole in no short or uncertain terms.<br/><br/>With this in mind, the tool of Stable Diffusion itself is novel and useful.  For instances where consenting parties contribute works that they hold copyright to, into a generative algorithm model, to create a novel work or to reduce the work required, I believe that this should have grounds for copyright.  An artist and writer who use a model built entirely with their own works should be considered to be using a tool, much in the same way as digital painting or simulations are creative tools for visual effects.<br/><br/>In short, I believe we need to curtail the use of large, illegitimately created AI models in regards to copyright, and relegate them to a novelty.  Failing to do so will definitively lead to a socioeconomic downturn.
