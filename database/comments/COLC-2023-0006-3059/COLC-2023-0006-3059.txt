Hello! I am a college student aspiring to be a storyboard artist in the film and television industries. The topic of AI and copyright is very important to me as a result of this. If AI images are used to generate things like shot layouts, that could cost me potential jobs. Plus, AI art and writing is generated through the use of the work of artists and writers who did not consent to their work being used in this manner. AI algorithm companies steal from artists, and it&#39;s frankly appalling.
