People should own their own faces. They should own their own voices. They should not have to worry about some corporation replacing them with a soulless clone, a digital puppet copy of themselves. AI should never be used to automate human creativity. Do not give corporations the right to steal their actors&#39; faces and voices. Do not give them the ability to own a digital slave.
