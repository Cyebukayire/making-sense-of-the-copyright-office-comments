There is essentially no way to disable AI from scraping anything that is posted on the public internet and using it as part of its training data. It isn&rsquo;t a person capable of making rational judgements, it can and will scrape and use copyrighted works. The AI does not make meaningful artistic choices, it aggregates and randomizes based on prompts, and those prompts themselves are not copyrightable. You may hear that AI learns the way a child or a human does, but that&rsquo;s a fundamental misunderstanding. Humans are inspired by outside factors, meanwhile the AI is a closed loop of a machine, capable only of creating works derivative of other works. Not to mention certain types of AI, such as ones that replicate people&rsquo;s voices, are trained on the data of a single person, whose livelihood that may be in the case of voice actors, and directly copying their unique human voice without consent.
