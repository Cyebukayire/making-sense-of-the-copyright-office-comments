AI art and writing might not be inherently damaging, but in our society where people have to struggle so hard to maintain a baseline existence it could topple modern culture. I, like many others, may have to prioritize making a basic subsistence income instead of creating cultural works, which I strongly believe will hurt innovation in fields farther reaching that visual arts and writing.
