AI steals and plagiarizes people&#39;s hard work in order &#39;create&#39; it&#39;s faux-art. <br/>There are already news stories written about authors who have had their books fed to an AI, so that new books could be written in the style of the author. And with the the author&#39;s name on the cover (w/o their knowledge or consent). The same has been happening to artists around the world. There are AI backers who have actually gone out of their way to target artists who have spoken out/are against AI drivel. (I won&#39;t call it art, because it isn&#39;t. Art has a piece of the artist be it their soul, blood, sweat, and tears in it.) <br/>And we have even seen corporations try to use AI in order to get around paying employees for their hard work. Film industry has tried to put into contracts clauses that would allow them to film a Scene Actor (aka an Extra) for one days work and pay them for that day. But the contract would then allow them to be able to use an AI program and the Scene Actor&#39;s likeness whenever they want. We say we are worried about jobs in America and then we keep creating new ways to take them away.<br/>So yeah, I am against AI.
