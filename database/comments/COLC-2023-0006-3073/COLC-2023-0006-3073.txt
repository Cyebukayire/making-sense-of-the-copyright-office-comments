I am a photographer and digital artist. I use AI as part of my work flow and as a creative tool, just as I would any other tool. Works created through the use of AI should be copyrightable just as any other work. Part of what I do is photograph dogs for rescues and shelters. I use AI to take them out of their kennels, and put them into scenes to make them more adoptable, yet I cannot copyright my own images because of the AI part.
