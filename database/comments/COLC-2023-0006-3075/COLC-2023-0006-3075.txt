I would like AI use of existing copyrighted works in training sets to require some sort of opt-in consent. It becomes very difficult to adequately protect copyrights on my own works when AI generated images can scrape them and generate pieces that very closely mimic my own pieces.<br/><br/>Data is very important for AI to train and create generative works- while the training process can be likened to a human artist referencing other works for inspiration and understanding, the degrees of separation between a user intentionally trying to mimic an artist mean that it&#39;s possible for end users to attempt to evade these copyright protections, unknowingly or not. If AI is used to generate a piece that is near identical to a copyrighted work that I&#39;ve created, due to unauthorized scraping/use of my work for training, it provides grounds for distribution of my work under unclear copyright laws at present.
