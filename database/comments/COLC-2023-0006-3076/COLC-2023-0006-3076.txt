As a creative mind, when I see AI created artwork, all I can think of is: &ldquo;where did they get the data used to make these images?&rdquo; AI is not a person and cannot spawn new ideas the way we do, so it&rsquo;s only option is to source the ideas for its image from real living, breathing, creative minds online. And that means it&rsquo;s stealing from them. Even though their work is derivative and may not look much like the works it sources it&rsquo;s piece from, it is still using their work when they have no idea and creative something using their skill and knowledge. And that is not fair, and thus should not be allowed to claim copyrights.
