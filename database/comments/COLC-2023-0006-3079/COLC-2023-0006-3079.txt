AI has the potential to be transformative for the world, only if it is left relatively unhampered. The only thing I would say is necessary is that in contracts it is specifically indicated as a specific provision; I.e. if you are a singer there must be a contract line present allowing the studio to use AI to replicate you/your voice, etc.
