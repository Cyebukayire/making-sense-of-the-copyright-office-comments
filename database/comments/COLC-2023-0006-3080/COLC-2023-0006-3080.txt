Artificial intelligence trained on art made by those who didn&#39;t consent to their work being used like this is unethical. Though the technology may have some practical uses, it cannot be trained on art or writing made by people who didn&#39;t consent to their work being used like that. Also, why should AI-generated material be protected by copyright? Why should AI generation be first-come-first-serve?
