No, AI art should not under copyright except for the artists who&#39;s work it was based on. If the original artists who&#39;s data is used are not credited or given consent to use of the AI generated work that, due to the nature of the algorithm, simply copies their work (which should be copyright protected as it is their work). Of course the copyright on the original material is more complicated, however given how AI&#39;s aren&#39;t creating they are simply regenerating data based on prompts. Reminder also that these data sets are not regulated, according to the guardian last year the training database for stable diffusion ended up with private photos and data including full names (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/12/when-ai-can-make-art-what-does-it-mean-for-creativity-dall-e-midjourney). Seeing how far AI art has spread there&#39;s a good chance not only is the content in the data sets stolen but could be private information.<br/><br/>Not only has this harm people&#39;s livelihood of artists like with Netflix not hiring artists for background art in &quot;The Dog &amp; The Boy&quot; (see https://mashable.com/article/netflix-ai-art-anime-boy-dog) or with AI art being used in advertising instead of hiring artists. My friends and I have personally seen them and there&#39;s articles about them such as https://wwd.com/business-news/media/how-brands-are-using-ai-images-advertising-editorial-1235776851/. Given the already precarious situation in the entertainment industry this could ruin lives and damage the industry as a whole.<br/><br/>It&#39;s so easy and available and fast to use that I could go on and make an image in a few seconds without knowing where the data comes from and that&#39;s exactly why it&#39;s so dangerous. Allowing this to have copyright protection only hurts actual copyrighted material and gives the dangerous precedent that actually paying artists for new art is obsolete. Because again remember, while the image created is technically new, it is just an AI stitching together previously made works by several real people--many of which are private or copyrighted. That&#39;s just how the AI works. As an artist myself this could hurt my job opportunities, especially if I upload an example of my work to give to clients and they simply add it to a training database, saying no to paying me for my services and generate an image with my art without my consent. The fact that this is a possibly at all, should be enough to show how damaging this is. Not to mention this is a true reality for famous artists which most likely have their art already in these databases. <br/><br/>All in all copyright should be given to the original creators, not to an image which uses the original images and copies them and many other images together without any human thought (besides the prompt). It damages artists, it damages industries and it damages lives.
