AI needs to be controlled and limited. It&rsquo;s dangerous and highly damaging to creative spaces and industries and will inevitably ruin a lot of people&rsquo;s lives. AI has already been used to desecrate and disrespect dead actors (The Flash and George Reeves&rsquo; deepfake). There&rsquo;s something inherently morally corrpupt about using the face of a man who ended his own life because his career was so stiffled by the role of Superman, and then people after his death, putting him back into that role.<br/>Additionally, AI has been used to sexually exploit women against their will and steal people&rsquo;s art, both living and after their deaths so that they can&rsquo;t even speak out against training ai to recreate their art.  <br/>This isn&rsquo;t the future of the industry if it is allowed to continue to exploit, abuse and take away people&rsquo;s rights to their bodies, their peace after death, and their safety even in life. This needs to be regulated and laws put into place to limit its capabilities to exploit the people on this earth. <br/>Our lives have weight and if the eternal march of progress tramples on the living, breathing people of this earth, what are you even here for? Regulations are meant to protect those with small voices, not those with deep and exploitative pockets. <br/>Do your jobs and make sure no one else is hurt by greed.
