I believe that it is not ethical or legal to use a person&rsquo;s work, copyrighted or not, to train AI, that AI should only be trained on public domain or works that are voluntarily and explicitly allowed by the creator to train AI, and that AI works cannot be copyrighted as they were not created by a human body or mind.
