Artificial Intelligence should not be allowed to train on works under copyright because their &quot;generative&quot; technology is just copying what they&#39;ve seen, which is stealing. Also, AI work should not be copyrightable because the AI is not actually making anything. It is reusing what actual people worked hard to create and to claim that the AI made and owns rights to works is unfair and absurd.
