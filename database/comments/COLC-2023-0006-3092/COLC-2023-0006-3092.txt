AI is theft no matter which way you slice it. It cannot innovate beyond our capacity without us so therefore it must use human experience/knowledge to produce. For example, for movie scripts, AI has to search every public database to learn script writing, style, prose and execution. Well, just because a script is public doesn&rsquo;t mean it can be used by someone else for profit. If a person did that they would be sued. So, in a sense we are indentured servants or slaves to whomever owns the AI system or benefiting from it (like a movie studio). It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a thousand tiny micro thefts; if there&rsquo;s any use for profit then it is stealing. It will discourage innovation in sectors beyond the arts as no doubt, corporate strategists will build AIs meant to compete and harm their competition which will in turn hurt the people it&rsquo;s stealing from more and more. We should also be careful of people/companies calling AI other names just to bypass the law. The language should be careful there. I think it could/should be a nice assistant or tool if needed but do we even really need it? Was like so bad before AI or did we just make it worse? Does the world feel better because of it? Not to me.
