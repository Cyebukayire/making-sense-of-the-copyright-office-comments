Thank you.  AI and AI companies need to remove all copyrighted works from their machine learning data sets.  Or if they want to use it in the data set, the company needs to pay the author/copyright holders for the privilege. Does anyone think, that if I, a private citizen, created something using AI with an entire data set of Mickey Mouse art, that Disney wouldn&rsquo;t sue me? Why should artists that don&rsquo;t have deep pockets and expensive lawyers have fewer protections?<br/><br/>Secondly, if art is generated by AI, it can&rsquo;t be copyrighted. Copyright protections should be for people, not machines. If companies do want legal protections, they should be able to patent the result. <br/><br/>If a pharmaceutical company uses AI to create new drugs, then they can patent that drug.  But only if they owned the patents for the drugs used in the data sets.<br/><br/>AI is going to change a great many thing, some even for the better, but if the current copyright holders aren&rsquo;t protected from having their art and creativity used in the vast machine learning data sets, we as a a society and culture won&rsquo;t have art, we&rsquo;ll have some very weird computer outputs, generated by software and algorithms, written by software engineers that will poorly mimic art.
