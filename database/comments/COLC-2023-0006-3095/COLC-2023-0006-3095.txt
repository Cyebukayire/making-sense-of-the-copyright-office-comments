We should not allow copyrights for AI generated music.  Music is a uniquely human creative endeavor - composition is a reflection of the human soul.  There is no art in having a computer listen to existing music and churn out a mathematical derivative.  AI is not a person - only people should be able to claim a copyright.  <br/><br/>I was hoping for a future where robots and AI would handle the hard work while humans are able to focus on art and the betterment of society - copyright protection for AI generated music is absolutely the wrong direction.
