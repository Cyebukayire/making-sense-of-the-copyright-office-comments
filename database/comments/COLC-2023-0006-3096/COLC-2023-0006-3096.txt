I am fine with AI to a certain degree, but there does need to be more regulations in my opinion. As of right now, there&#39;s nothing stopping people from using different artist&#39;s voices, art, etc. and using ai to make something. Then proceed to say they made it, and honestly, how is that any different than plagiarism. The artist&#39;s arent even being paid. Like with the situation on people using ai voices to make an actor or a fictional character they like sing something. The voice actors aren&#39;t getting compensated. That&#39;s their voice, but not only are people making their voice say things that might be against their ideals, theyre not even getting paid. Also, another thing with ai, especially with writing, is just how dangerous it is. On some sites like Amazon, there are inaccurate/fake guides on things such as foraging and people are gonna get poisoned from that. We already live in a world filled with misinformation, we do not need to make the issue worse.
