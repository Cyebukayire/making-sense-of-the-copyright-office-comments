Gen Ai should not be allowed to be trained on work that is not in the public domain without express written consent and compensation. Gen ai should not be allowed to be used as a &quot;tools&quot; in works without the ai in question being trained as said above and no project or work using gen ai in anyway other then as said above should be copyright able. Artist, musician, writers, voice actor, normal actors did not consent to having their hard work taken and used to train these gen ais and most of us are not ok with how they are currently trained and used all current gen ai companies should be held accountable for the blatant theft that is their software. Gen ai could have been a tool but in its current state it is theft there is literally medical file photos in some art ai gen learning models and I&#39;m sure the patients did not consent to their bodies being used that way.
