do you want the collapse of art in the entertainment industry and see millions of jobs lost for the sake of profit to line the pockets of CEOs cuz that&#39;s how you get that. this AI is just mashing together already existing art to vomit out weird images, this cycle won&#39;t last and will end at some point anyways and for the time it does exist in the industry it&#39;s just going to put people out of work till the AI is producing what studio want anymore. there will be pain.
