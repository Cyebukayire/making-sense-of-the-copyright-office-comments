Attainable Edge is an AI startup. I&#39;m an experienced IT executive with over 20 years of experience who left the corporate world to start a company focused in AI because I believe it&#39;s going to change the world.  With all change, it will have good and bad, but I&#39;m an optimist and I believe with the right controls it can elevate the standard of living for billions.<br/><br/>I strongly believe that Copyright should be restricted to art that is created by people - without substantial human contribution, allowing copyright for AI works seems to me to create a runaway situation that will make things worse for all Americans.<br/><br/>The human creative process takes time, AI creation is essentially free and instantaneous. If we allow copyright for AI generated goods what stops someone running an army of generative AI 24/7 to generate copyrighted works around almost every concept imaginable specifically to own the IP created by the AI? Crazy you say? Look at what has happened to domain name squatting - the people registered to own the domains aren&#39;t doing it because they want to use the domains themselves, they are spectators hoping to reap great rewards when someone else does actually want to use that name.<br/><br/>Companies will follow profit motive to abuse the system if you allow copyright for AI generated works, please don&#39;t allow this to happen.
