Artificial Intelligence is, like any tool, potentially dangerous if misused, and current economic trajectories and government considerations are indeed poised to utilize it in ways that would harm the rights and livelihoods of private citizens. AI content cannot exist without human-generated examples, and when it is prioritized, those people&rsquo;s work is improperly credited, not fairly compensated and potentially forgotten. It should not be used in creative industries for this reason. It is best for automatic mechanical processes, not to replace intellectual property that people work their whole lives for. Please limit or prohibit the use of artificial intelligence in creative industries, and in any case where an employable individual could perform just as well in a vocation. This will help the economy and national well being.
