As an artist and writer who makes a living off my work, I am now living in fear of people using AI on my work and stealing it from me for their own use. It also takes away from the hard work, time, and integrity of not just my works but also the works of my community as well. Users of ai should not be able to hold copyright of their work nor should they be able to use ours if hold the copyright to it.
