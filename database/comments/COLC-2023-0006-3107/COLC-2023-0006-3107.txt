Please, dont let these AI pirates ruin creativity, creative industries. Don&#39;t let them abuse works, they cant even do, they shouldn&#39;t have any rights to do so. <br/>Why should be people, that cant even draw, be making profits on expense of artists? Why should people, that cant even sing, be making profits on expense of musician&#39;s. Do the right thing and expend copyright to all creative works. <br/>Copyright should not be protecting only the rich, only the corporations. Copyright should also protect normal people, small creators, starting artists.<br/>So please, use it right and protect original creators. If anything, these AI abuse corporations should pay huge fines for the stolen works, names, likeness, identities, brands, names, everything.<br/>Please do the right thing and do not let them go away with this theft of the century.
