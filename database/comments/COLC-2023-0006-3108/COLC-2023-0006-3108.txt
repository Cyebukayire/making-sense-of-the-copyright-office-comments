I am a Computer Scientist, and have used AI/LLMs to assess their use in coding, content generation and image creation. It is clear to me that many publicly-available LLMs have used copyrighted material to train their software. This allows derivative works to be created easily, quickly, and repeatedly, with no notice, permission, or compensation to the original copyright holders. The data being used to train LLMs should be opted-in from the original creators, and due compensation given, unless the data is public domain.
