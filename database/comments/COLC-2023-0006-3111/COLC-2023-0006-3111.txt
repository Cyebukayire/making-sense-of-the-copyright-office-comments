AI is actively making life worse for everyone, whether they be creatives such as artists or writers or the people enjoying their work, or students looking for research as many news sources turn to AI to write for them. It steals pre existing work while leaving those that fed it in the dust, and should be cut off at the source. It has no right to copyright and anyone who has had work stolen to feed AI should be fairly compensated.
