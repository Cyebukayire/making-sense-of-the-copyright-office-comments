I am a pastor who uses ai generated art to  help communicate. There is plenty of creative labor that goes into the process of using mid journey. I believe that somehow there should be a way to have copyright reflect that&hellip; similar to how photography is creative work even if the objects being used to generate the photos (the subject of the photo) are themselves not owned by the photographer.<br/><br/>The person using the ai system should be responsible for what they create and share. They should be able to copyright it.<br/>AI systems could be designed in such a way that the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; could be related to a unique identity so that people could never generate pixel perfect copies by &ldquo;accident&rdquo;.  <br/><br/>The tool creators should be responsible for creating tools that do not produce verbatim copies of others original works, and ethically sourcing training data.<br/><br/>Deepfakes, impersonation, and fake news are all issues that need dealing with, however perhaps that is not a copyright issue.<br/><br/>I believe human original work is worth protecting, but the current ai tools are still just tools.
