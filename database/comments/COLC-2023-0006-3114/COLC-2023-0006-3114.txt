I believe that A.I programs used to create images and A.I used to select people for jobs should not only be outlawed, but completely dismantled. A.I programs used to create images could potentially be used to create fraudulent evidence and they also steal and use posted art online to aid in their generation. They are a threat to society. The A.I used to select people among job applications is not a good idea and could lead to people who need work being rejected. Please, take action against these A.I.
