AI is a shameful stealing of real writers&#39; work. As both an editor and a writer myself, it is deeply insulting to me that someone could take my work and train their machine on it without my expressed permission. Furthermore, I am aware of how incompetent AI truly is, and know that it will copy entire chunks of my work as opposed to a person, who might be merely inspired be it. <br/><br/>Under absolutely no circumstances should AI scraping be passable as copyright. This process takes absolutely zero work from a human person and furthermore most often output nonsense. Not only would any AI work be entirely stolen off the shelves of truly deserving authors, but it would bring shame to the publishing industry, as AI is only capable enough to string together grammatically correct phrases, and not sentences that carry any meaning.<br/><br/>Please do not allow AI to obtain copyright.
