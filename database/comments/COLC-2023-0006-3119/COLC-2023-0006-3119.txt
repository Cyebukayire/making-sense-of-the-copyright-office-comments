Allowing companies / individuals to copyright materials produced using generative AI models is an absurdity. By definition,everything produced using generative AI models has been produced by utilizing the (unpaid) labor of others, especially writers, but not just; any single professional who has to put words on paper or a screen in order to do their job. Fair adaptations of others&#39; work, or considered remixes / collages / combinations of others work, is copyrightable because it is original work; in other words, someone had the idea to do it. Nothing produced using AI is based on an original thought process that would make the adaptation of the work of others (again: every generative AI functions only by cannibalizing the unpaid work of others) copyrightable. It&#39;s absurd to say that a computer can steal your work without thought, but we&#39;re going to let them claim it because they used a computer. We wouldn&#39;t let real live people engage in that kind of theft, so why is it OK for companies and individuals to do so just because it&#39;s done through the medium of a software program? Further, copyright is and has always been a mechanism of protecting individual labor. Allowing copyrights to apply to material produced through AI protects nobody&#39;s labor, only the investment made in purchasing the software. There is no intellectual property to protect in works produced by AI, because &quot;intellectual property&quot; is defined (by the World Intellectual Property Organization, see https://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/) as &quot;creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.&quot; An AI doesn&#39;t have a mind. It has a pattern recognition algorithm and a lot of stolen IP from other people. Now if someone wants to copyright the *algorithm* then great--I&#39;m sure the makers of ChatGPT are on it. But you can&#39;t just invent rights for nonsentient algorithms. The only possible benefactors are those who doe not want to spend time on &quot;creations of the mind.&quot; Finally, this is a labor issue. If AI is allowed to be copyrighted, whole swaths of industries are decimated, for no better services or products. Everyone loses except for the owners of the AI.
