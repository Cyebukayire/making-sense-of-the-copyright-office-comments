There are several consequences that concern me if this is allowed.  The first is the obvious, unemployment.  This will take jobs away from the skilled and trained to produce an inferior product.<br/><br/>Less obvious, this will result in a burden your office cannot bear.  When companies gain the ability to cycle through thousands of pieces a day, they will want to copyright them all.  There will be a race to see which company can lock down the most music, the most images, even the most concepts in writing.  Imagine corporate entities with tens of thousands of filings a day.  This will be done &quot;Just in case they need those copyrights later&quot;.  You can never, ever hope to process copyright filings mass generated by machines.<br/><br/>Least obvious, this will do long term harm to our ability to produce art.  AI churns, mixes and matches, but it does not create.  It recontextualizes at best.  In 50 or 100 years we will have lost our capacity to do these things ourselves.  At that time AI will have done all the recombining it can do, and art itself will feel hollow.  We will have bored ourselves at the same time we have eroded our skill base.<br/><br/>The purpose of this office is to incentive creative work.  For your basic function, please, do not allow any AI generated work copyright protection.
