I believe that AI, as a combination of the world&rsquo;s intelligence, should be treated as a public good, and any works created by an AI should not be copyrighted, as they are building off the blocks of thousands of people who may or may not have consented to being part of its training. AI is a tool, but without a human component tied to the creative process, allowing AI generated works to be copyrighted would lead to a decrease in creativity and an increase in regurgitated copies of uninspired works.
