Hello,<br/><br/>I am writing to express that AI generated material should not receive copyright protection. <br/><br/>AI as it stands cannot produce without human input. While private hubs of AI may work on private datasets, large scraping of data used to generate data, images, video, etc, irresponsibly takes from individuals without their consent, often infringing on the copywrite of others.
