It has been clear over the past year that these tools, originally marketed as being a way to support people in their jobs, is being exploited to do the exact opposite and replace these people. Executives from entertainment studios to technology hardware firms have openly stated they plan to replace real humans with these generative AI platforms. But time and time again the efficacy and veracity of the solutions brought on by the tool are at best inaccurate and at worst a dangerous tool for misinformation. From a copyright perspective these tools are meant to pull from already created (and in many cases copyright protected) material to generate a response. It isn&rsquo;t creating anything new so it should not be subject to being able to be copyrighted. At the most, it should be used as a tool and not a replacement for actual human creativity. We are already seeing an upswing of fascist action aimed at crushing creativity and I fear without regulation generative AI will be used to further that. It must be regulated in all aspects but specifically for copyright issues, it doesn&rsquo;t take any discipline to create something and is already stealing copyrighted content. Therefore, anything created with AI should not be allowed to be protected, if it is built off of the concept of stealing protected content.
