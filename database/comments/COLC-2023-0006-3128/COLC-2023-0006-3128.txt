We are in a time where creative fields are continuously being attacked and devalued. Books are being banned, the WGA has been on strike for months, schools are cutting funding for the arts. And now we have AI to deal with. Many artists and writers have had their work fed into AI for training purposes without the express permission of the artist. That is theft, plain and simple. People who have spent years learning and developing their craft and style are now seeing cheap knock-offs of their work because of Artificial Intelligence. There need to be regulations in place that can support the use of AI while safeguarding the rights of creatives. <br/><br/>AI-generated creative works should be required to be labeled as such so consumers can know what they&#39;re getting&mdash;that it is not a 100% original, human-created work. I am not against the ability to copyright AI-generated works, but they cannot be classified in the same way as an original work. Original work and AI-generated work are two completely different things and should have their own categories and regulations, even if some of those regulations are similar or overlap. <br/><br/>In order to enter something into AI for training purposes, permission to do so must be acquired and checked so that artists and writers can earn a profit off of the work they&#39;ve created. If permission is not acquired, artists and writers should be able to seek legal action. The rampant theft happening currently is unacceptable and regulating AI is long overdue. <br/><br/>There need to be laws regarding abuse of AI technology and punishments in place for breaking those laws. The use of AI to create a video of a human being talking about something without their consent is a gross abuse of privacy. This is called a deepfake and it can hugely impact our society. Someone who has been the victim of a deepfake video should be allowed to press charges and seek justice.<br/><br/>More and more we live in a time of technology. We cannot ignore AI and there are many benefits to the use of AI technology, but it needs to be regulated. Right now everything is unclear and those in the creative fields are left lost and confused on what to do and how they can seek justice for stolen work.
