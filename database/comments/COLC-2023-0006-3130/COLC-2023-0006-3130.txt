AI should never be allowed to use copyrighted material to learn or create. Period. Without the human ability to synthesize and create new material from inspiration, it&#39;s just theft.

Creating X in the style of Y is even worse. And since this is just stolen property from a chop shop, AI should not be able to copyright it&#39;s product.
