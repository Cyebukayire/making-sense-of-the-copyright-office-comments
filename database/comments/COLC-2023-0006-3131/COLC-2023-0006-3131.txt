I am a Casting Director, working in the Entertainment Industry. AI can be used to learn from my previous notes, selected auditions, descriptive terms (known as breakdowns,) that I use on a daily basis to do my job. Casting is a craft. One that I learned over the course of many years, through many experiences, good and bad. That is decades of labor that could be effectively stolen, simply because I use certain online services to do my job. To distill my craft down to x&#39;s and o&#39;s would harm not only me and my peers, but the actors who we look at and seek out. The AI systems would be training off of their auditions, tapes WE collect; work which they&#39;ve entrusted us to keep private. If any of us had had any idea that our work and these precious tapes would be used to harm us and other artists, we would&#39;ve stayed analogue.<br/><br/>Casting Directors are artists. We are not clerical workers. We are not pencil pushers. We are highly trained and 100% unique. My collection of efforts may not have been officially copywritten, but it is in fact, mine. I do not consent to my work being used to train AI and I hope you will consider strong regulations around stealing of people&#39;s long-time efforts to feed into these systems.
