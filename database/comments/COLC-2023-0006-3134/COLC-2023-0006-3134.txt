I do not believe that AI generated content should be copyrightable, as that will inevitably deprive every creative field of its ability to employ a human workforce. As AI can generate random outputs extremely rapidly, it would be difficult to prevent a massive copyright grab movement from taking place, where AI farms copyright as many works as possible to prevent the survival or thriving of its human competition. Beyond that, since many AI are trained on works that are copyrighted, I believe that its every creation is an act of plagiarism.
