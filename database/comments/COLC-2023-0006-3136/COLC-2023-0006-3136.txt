I feel that the use of copyrighted material to train AI should go against copyright laws. While a normal person taking inspiration from a copyrighted work to use in something their own is similar, AI inherently does not have the creativity or intention to make something new and transformative. Simply to take what it has been given and spit that back out in whatever way it thinks is coherent. Whereas a person trying to write or draw in another person&rsquo;s style is creating their own new piece, AI is taking that creator&rsquo;s work, breaking it apart, and putting it back together. It is not creating anything inherently new or adding new ideas, just using what is has been given and only what it has been given. That is unfair to those whose copyrighted material was used to train said AI, and so I feel there should be legal limitations and repercussions for those who use it without permission from the creator.
