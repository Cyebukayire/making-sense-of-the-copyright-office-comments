AI sampling is the greatest issue that has been brought to creative&#39;s attention. Already artists have felt the sting with their personal works being used in composites without fair acknowledgement. In my opinion, restricting AI code generation to works tagged as stock, public domain, or catalog specific would be a safe way to mitigate sampling while utilizing this new technology. That is to say, developers must tell the program what codes and forms are acceptable to use in strict terms for it to be utilized in such a way to be helpful instead of detrimental.
