As an artist, our community already has to fight people stealing and reselling out work. With AI, the bots are able to essentially steal thousands of work at a time to copy artists and rehash their work. It is extremely rare for artists to give their consent to have their work be used to train the AI. <br/><br/>AI is a mash up of multiple people&#39;s work created by a computer which infringes copyright of all the original pieces. This could be even more complicated if the image includes anything owned by bigger companies; like Disney, Universal, or Pokemon. Pokemon has even stated on their website that they own anything made related to Pokemon. <br/><br/>As a reminder, the WGA and SAG/AFTRA on currently on strike in part due to AI involvement. Studios wanting to use a persons voice or image without further compensation due to AI.
