AI as it is currently implemented is a total black box. We have no idea what most models were trained on, what art/writing was used with permission and what was scraped and stolen, and no control over your own work being scraped or stolen. The technology used is interesting, but the way it works now is clearly violating copywrite law. <br/><br/>If I trace a painting and try to sell it as my own without attribution, license, or royalty fees, that&#39;s clearly wrong, so why is it different when the theft is done at-scale, with millions of stolen pieces, instead of just one? AI generated works should not be allowed to be sold or produced commercially without giving the public full access to the training set, and each training set for commercial use must have a license to use every work included. If I plug in 100 episodes of Fraiser, have an AI write a script based on that, and try to sell it to ABC with a few names changed, how is that any different than rearranging preexisting Frasier scripts myself and selling them? One seems to violate current IP law, the other somehow doesn&#39;t, even though the only real difference is that the rearrangement of words was done by a human and the other was done by what is essentially a word calculator.
