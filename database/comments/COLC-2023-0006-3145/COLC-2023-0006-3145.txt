So-called &quot;AI&quot; (which it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s just algorithm-based plagiarism) is a violation of copyright, pure and simple. It doesn&#39;t generate anything that is envisaged under Fair Use, it doesn&#39;t come up with anything original, and it does not produce anything by a human creator. It absolutely does not create anything that deserves to be protected under Copyright Law.
