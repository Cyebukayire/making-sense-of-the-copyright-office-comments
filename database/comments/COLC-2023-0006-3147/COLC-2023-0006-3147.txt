I&#39;m greatly concerned about the use of generative AI and its stifling effect on creativity and ownership of intellectual property. Generative AI mimics plagiarism on a mass scale heretofore unseen by human history. It has great potential to speed up creation, but it completely removes incentive, financial and otherwise, for people to create new things. This could be the death of human creativity as an industry. And we are at a crux of history where our choices will have huge ramifications for history after us. <br/><br/>Generative AI has so much potential and this is not to say it can be banned. But it can be harnessed and regulated in a way that doesn&#39;t destroy a whole chunk of society while it&#39;s being tamed and understood.
