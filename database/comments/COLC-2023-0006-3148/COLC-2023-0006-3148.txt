AI &quot;art&quot; be it text, audio, or image, is intellectual property theft disguised as innovation. This holds true for everything ranging from midjourney spitting out a prompted image that appropriates an existing artist&#39;s style (in a way that, were an individual to do so for financial gain, would expose them to financial penalties), to wave after wave of content mills making search results almost worthless because of flooding the page with AI-generated garbage, to (and this is the one I REALLY want you to weigh in on) predatory production companies scanning background extras and using their likenesses in perpetuity because they spent a day on set for scale pay. I don&#39;t care if the current writers&#39; and actors&#39; strikes reach some sort of deal about this one, IT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED full stop.<br/><br/>There is nothing gained in a civilization that automates art while devaluing the artist. It&#39;s your job as a copyright office to recognize the existential threat to the very concept of copyrightable material that is represented by a system (AI, learning models, etc.) that CAN ONLY FUNCTION if it is &quot;trained&quot; on terabytes of theft. It&#39;s your responsibility as a part of civil society to ensure that our children actually hear human voices and ideas and not n-th generation lossy Xeroxes of whatever some startup originally stole from.<br/><br/>Please. Absolutely wreck these guys. Humanity will thank you.
