Greetings,<br/><br/>I am a French citizen writing this message from abroad. I am not an actor, neither a musician or writer, but as many do I regularly watch shows, comics or listen to music, many being made in the United States of America. I want to remind everyone reading those lines that A.I. regulation has an impact on copyright laws for individuals worldwide.<br/><br/>I am not personally against the A.I. technology. However, it should be regulated by clear and stable rules regarding copyright.<br/><br/> 1 &ndash; One should not use media which they don&rsquo;t own as training data for a product meant to be sold / copyrighted. If asked, the A.I. generator user must be able to prove that all datasets used are either their own or from a free-to-use database.<br/><br/> 2 &ndash; Any A.I. program must require the explicit agreement of a content creator (writer, voice actor, illustrator, etc.) for their content to be used as training data, and/or to be sold or copyrighted. If the resulting product is intended for commercialization, said content creator must receive remuneration according to a defined contract by both parties.<br/><br/> 3 &ndash; Any A.I. content should not be allowed to be mistakenly labeled as not generated by A.I.<br/><br/> 4 &ndash; Any AI content must not be wrongly credited to a content creator who was not involved in its conception. (Example : to affirm that a writer is involved in a script, without that writer having participated.)<br/><br/>Although I am not involved in lawmaking, I am sure that people with the appropriate knowledge would write those lines better. But the rules listed above are not new : they have their equivalents in current copyright laws. A.I. generative content is a new technology that has not yet been defined in terms of rules and laws. I have no doubt that a comprehensive and regulated set of laws would ensure the safety and creativity of both small creators and entertainment industries.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading the point of viewpoint of a foreigner from across the world, and sorry if I made some grammatical errors! My hope is that this humble viewpoint can have an influence on your debate.<br/><br/>Goodbye !
