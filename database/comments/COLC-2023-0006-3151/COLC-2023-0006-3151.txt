As an Artist myself, I find the current model of AI to be inherently immoral in its construction. From its very conception, it was made to rob artists of their hard work, years of honing their craft and skill only to rub it back in our faces as &quot;new artwork&quot; with no effort and no skill. Not one company that has created these AI &quot;art&quot; generators asked a single artist if their work could be used. It was scraped from the internet with no consent and that in and of itself is theft of intellectual property of those artists. If AI is to be used for art, writing or even voice acting, it needs to be built with consent. Artists in all their forms should be asked first before their work can be fed into this machine. This cannot be debatable.
