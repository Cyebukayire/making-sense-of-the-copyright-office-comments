Works created through the use of artificial intelligence need to be covered under a dedicated branch of copyright and patent law.  Those laws need to define what parts of the creative process can be protected as well as the kinds of protection that are provided.  It also needs to address the use of previously protected materials in the creation of the work.  Specific requirements for the documentation of the creation must also be provided.  Ideally this new coverage would be crafted such that it&#39;s adaptable to future creative technologies.
