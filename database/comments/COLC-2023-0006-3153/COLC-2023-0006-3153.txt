AI steals from every creator ever. Copyrights exist to protect our media. They should absolutely and wholly prevent the stealing of material for use by an AI engine. If AI ultimately replaces human creation (God Forbid), the quality of media, music, art, writing and more will head in a never ending downward spiral. A machine can never replace the kind of art (in all its forms) that a human can make. Allowing AI to infringe upon creators is a gross mistake and should be illegal if not, I repeat, heavily, heavily regulated. Better content especially in the film industry is worth paying writers, actors and everybody more. (As I recall, to do this, major corporations would only need to sacrifice very small amounts of their companies&#39; income.) AI would not solve the problem. Audience views would descend. Revenue would decline. Major movie industries would decline permanently. All art is only as good as it&#39;s people. Don&#39;t allow AI to be the main force behind creativity when machines are supposed to be doing the hard work, not the work that brings humans actual joy.
