AI and businesses use of AI has rapidly grown and desperately needs to be regulated. Currently the majority of its use is by companies and individuals looking to replicate and replace working artists, writers, musicians, voice actors, etc with things that look or sound close to their work, primarily because it&#39;s being sourced from their work without consent. There should be glaringly obvious issues with copyright when it comes to AI produced work and those creating these datasets need to be held accountable for scraping and sourcing work that they cannot meaningfully credit or pay dues for using. We should all be incredibly concerned with how quickly businesses jumped at the chance to replace real workers with cheap imitation work, that not only has an issue with copyright but when it comes to written information, is often just straight misinformation. Depending on who is using it and for what purpose, widespread AI use can drastically muddy the waters of information and lead to dangerous perpetuation of misinformation. There are ethical use cases of AI driven technology but we need regulation to ensure that ALL use cases of AI technology is ethical. Generative AI data sets must only be sourced from either a company&#39;s own work to be used internally or from people who explicitly opt in to have their work used and are paid accordingly. We cannot allow the current theft of hundreds and thousands of individuals work to continue. Regulation has lagged too far behind AI use and we need strong, clear regulation on its use now.
