As an educator working with young learners and teaching them about plagiarism, the necessity of stopping AI from using not just copyrighted, but any materials not willingly provided by its creator, is utterly apparent. To take the work of another without consent is to steal. To pass that work off as your own without citation or permission, in an educational setting at least, is plagiarism. This is an important lesson to teach our youth and to uphold in our technology. We as Americans must hold ourselves to a higher standard than to allow art and writing to be stolen and plagiarized without consequence.
