Copyright should not be available for AI-generated works. The point of copyright is to protect the work of the creator. With AI-generated works, no human creator exists. Computers do not need their work protected. Computers do not need income. Some may argue that a human entered the terms that generated the content, but this is not the work of a creator. Should we copyright Google searches because a human entered search terms in the box? With AI-generated works, the only human-created work is the AI itself. Everything the AI makes is an algorithmic response. This is to say nothing of the fact that most current AIs were built on the stolen works of other creators that are actually under copyright, for which no license was granted. Do not allow copyright for AI-generated works. It defies the entire point of copyright.
