Do we really want the owners of the most computers to own virtually all the intellectual property? Do we really want to discourage human creativity? The only solution is to explicitly outlaw ANY copyright protections for AI-generated work. Further, a human&#39;s modifications must be more than 51% to be eligible for any possible IP rights. AI could still create (based only on authorized input), just don&#39;t give machines intellectual property rights. Otherwise, you&#39;ll be destroying incentives for human creativity.
