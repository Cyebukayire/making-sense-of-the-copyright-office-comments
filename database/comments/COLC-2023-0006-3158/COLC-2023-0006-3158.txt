Algorithm-generated content requires impossibly vast amounts of sample data to allow the program to make something, and even when it &quot;makes&quot; something it is simply smashing together elements from that sample data. It requires amounts of data so vast that even a well-funded and motivated group trying to make enough samples on their own simply can&#39;t do it, assuming they even have the proficiency required to make something in the discipline they&#39;re making an algorithm for. So they use sample data from all over the internet and other resources, without seeking permission from the original creators of the works used as samples. Then they seek to monetize these creations, specifically to avoid having to ever pay a person for the labor of creating something, again without ever having a thought for the people whose work they took to generate things with. I feel that anything created in such a way should either be inherently in the public domain, OR considered to be the property of the creatives whose work was put into the machine as sample data, with no in between of those options making any sense to me.
