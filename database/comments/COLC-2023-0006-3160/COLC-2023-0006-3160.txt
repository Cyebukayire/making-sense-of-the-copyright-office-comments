With respect to using human created, copyrighted content towards machine learning/training, it seems reasonable to use the laws around using copyright material for audio sampling. It is my understanding that if you sample an audio recording without the express permission of the owner, you are infringing the owner&#39;s copyright. Regardless of whether the source is music, TV, film, or some other audio recording, a creator cannot use the material for commercial distribution without obtaining permission and then also sighting the work(s) so that the owners of the sampled work may be credited and (if applicable) paid for the use of their work. One example that comes to mind is the 2010 Kayne West song &quot;Power&quot; which samples the 1969 King Crimson song &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man.&quot; Although &quot;Power&quot; was largely, produced, recorded, and performed by Kayne West, it still made use of the sample from the 1969 song and, as such, had to credit the authors of the original King Crimson track, in this case, Fripp, Giles, Lake, McDonald, and Sinfield. Any AI that is leveraging original works to learn or create is, in a sense, &quot;sampling&quot; Copyright materials and should be held to the same standards as a human creator using those materials.
