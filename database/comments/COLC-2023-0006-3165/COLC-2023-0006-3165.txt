AI is an amalgamation of human ideas by design.  Unless it is somehow NOT trained on massive amounts of human engineered data, it will always be a form of theft.  It lacks the capacity, fundamentally, to synthesize ideas, it can only predict patterns.  Being able to copyright what it creates will disincentivize actual human creativity and art.  Instead, already greedy corporations that don&#39;t see fit to compensate their workers fairly will generate schlocky disconnected stories without souls, unable to maintain any sense of consistency between the characters and themes and even which events have taken place and which haven&#39;t.  Additionally, whole or partial phrasing and brushwork will inevitably be stolen from actual works of art.  AI goes against the entire point of copyright, because if anyone can auto-generate reams of text from other writers or click a button and create an amalgam of art originally conceived by other humans and call it their own, why have a copyright protection system at all?  Who is being protected anymore?
