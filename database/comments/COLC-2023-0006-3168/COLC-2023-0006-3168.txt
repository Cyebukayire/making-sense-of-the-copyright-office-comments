If anyone (multimillion dollar corporation or an individual) uses my labor and skill in writing to construct an AI model or create an app, then I should receive a percentage of their profit. One small example: I&#39;ve already had Benji Smith of https://www.shaxpir.com/ use 3 of my novels (and those of other novelists) to create his Shaxpir app, which he charges $7.99 a month to access. None of the authors, whose works he scraped, has received compensation for this yet he is making money from a work product designed on the back of our work. If you don&#39;t protect copyright from AI constructs, there is no point in copyright. It&#39;s time the US government protects the intellectual property of authors against big tech&#39;s idea that everything is free for them to use.
