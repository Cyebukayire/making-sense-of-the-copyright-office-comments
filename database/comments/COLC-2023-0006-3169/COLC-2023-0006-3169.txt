AI needs more transparency and restrictions. User data&#39;s use to train AI should be opt-in, not opt-out. AI should not be used to replace work/jobs in the humanities, such as in art fields or in social services, and should not take away jobs in favor of AI. AI should never, EVER, be used for therapy, that should be 100% illegal with no exceptions. And AI work should not be eligible for copyright, as it is using the work of a small number of software developers to create products with next to no effort from anyone who uses their AI. There is literally nothing new or inventive about it since it&#39;s using preexisting data and only able to create using that preexisting data, and therefore should not be eligible for copyright protections.
