It is absolutely abhorrent that AI work &mdash; scraped and built on the backs of human blood, sweat, and tears &mdash; can even be copy righted. Leaving actual human work vulnerable. Is this what the world has come to? Protecting artificial intelligence at the cost of actual human creativity? Shame for even having this up for debate.
