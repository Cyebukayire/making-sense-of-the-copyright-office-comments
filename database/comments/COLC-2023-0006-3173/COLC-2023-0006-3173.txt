Hello. If AI is unchecked, and allowed to rapidly displace human labor across all fields, it will have catastrophic effects on society. In the past, new jobs grew where old ones died. But with AI the sole purpose seems to be to eliminate labor entirely. You already see it aimed at desirable professions like writing/marketing/etc. And all of this is done through THEFT of intellectual property.
