Content made by Artificial Intelligence (herein known as &ldquo;A.I.&rdquo;) consistently and carelessly infringes on copyright. Standard copyright protections that the law offers become disregarded and A.I. has been able to find work arounds to the law. These A.I. are created by people and their coding essentially allows them to scan everything ever made and convert it into something else. No work can be safe as long as A.I. can pull from it. While there are some exceptions to copyright infringement, such as a fair use or parody argument, A.I. cannot use either of those. The work is not intended to be transformative. A.I. is stealing peoples Intellectual Property and must be stopped or restricted
