<br/>AI has stolen from many artists already, it&#39;s an underhanded and insulting tool that is being used to undermine artists and writers. It needs to be heavily regulated as work being taken and consumed without consent is now actively making it difficult for many creatives to find work. In short, AI is killing the American artist. We will not have anything of worth in the future commercially if this is not regulated.
