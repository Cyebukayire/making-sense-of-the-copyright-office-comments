I don&rsquo;t think AI art should be something copyright protects. Like there is no skill in finding an image in google search, there is no skill in AI generated art/writing. It is a mass of regurgitated data, fitted together in a way it&rsquo;s commonly seen. AI generated articles don&rsquo;t even lead to concrete sources.
