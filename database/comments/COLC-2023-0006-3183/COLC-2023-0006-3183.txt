To whom it may concern,<br/>I am opposed to the concept of granting copyright protection to AI-produced works, and I support reserving copyright for works for which a human is responsible for the bulk of the creative effort.<br/>First, the current state of generative technology means that any AI-generated work uses the work of human artists without their permission, and without compensation to them.<br/>Second, to grant copyright status to AI-generated works does nothing to protect actual human labor and economic effort. Providing a prompt to an interface may result in a song, poem, picture, or even a novel, but the labor is not equivalent to what it would be if a human were responsible for the generative effort.<br/>Third, providing copyright protection to AI-generated works would in fact lessen the protections given to human creators by flooding the market with AI-generated works that mimic those same human creators, built off of their own labor. For example, a song made to mimic Jay-Z&#39;s music would use actual Jay-Z songs to generate new songs. None of the revenue earned by the AI-generated songs would go to Jay-Z himself.<br/>While it is true that artists and creatives of all kinds use technology in the creation of their work, a line must be drawn if the only human action involved is coming up with a prompt. There are assistive tools such as graphic design software, and then there is the removal of the need for any training, experience, and knowledge on the part of the human producing the work. If no skill is required, then copyright protection should not be awarded.<br/>Thank you for your time!
