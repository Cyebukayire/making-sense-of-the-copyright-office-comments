AI works should not be protected by copyright law. They were not created by a human and AI itself is a violation of copyright law.<br/><br/>Works created by AI were created by the AI, not the human that commanded it. It would be like if an artist&#39;s manager could claim copyright on anything the artist created. <br/><br/>Also, AI can be a violation of copyright itself. AI steals from others (most often individuals who did create the piece and should be protected under copyright) to create works. The pieces created by AI can and will copy far too close to original, human-made works. It&#39;s fully capable of plagiarism if commanded. You can look to an artist who streamed their artwork and one of their followers took the image, completed it with AI ( terribly if i might add), and tried to say the original artist was the copycat. The artist had spent hours working on an amazing piece of art, only to have some cretin with AI try and steal it from them.<br/><br/>AI cannot be protected; it goes against the very soul of copyright law: protecting individuals from theft of their hardwork. AI is theft and is not created by individuals.
