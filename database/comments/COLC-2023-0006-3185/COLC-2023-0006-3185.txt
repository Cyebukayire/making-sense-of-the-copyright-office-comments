AI generated content of any kind needs to be ineligible for copyright. AI generated material is fundamentally different from creations made using other widely available materials, such as paintings or films or voice acting or an extra&#39;s performance in the background, by virtue of AI content merely being curated by people. If we end up in a society at any point where these AI are considered to have sentience or rights of any kind, then maybe we could one day consider the AI itself holding the copyright, but we do not currently exist in that society. Any AI generated images using my prompts and then selected by me is no more mine than an image I requested a friend draw. Because my friend can intelligibly and meaningfully give me the rights to the image they made, the AI generated example is actually even less mine. AI models which &quot;produce content&quot; should also make it clear what data has been fed into those models and the relevant copyright holders of that material should be compensated monetarily by the company which maintains the model and feeds it such data. Creators should also have the ability to, by default, not have their materials scraped for AI learning, and it should be a process where creators can meaningfully consent into the process if they so desire and are compensated monetarily.
