AI is often used without the consent of artists and is constantly used by various websites where artists are known to congregate without their permission. The current Hollywood strikes also have the usage of AI as a concern where writers and actors are protesting the possibility of having their likenesses stolen to be used by AI, along with voice actors having their voices used to &quot;train&quot; AI, putting many actors, artists, and writers out of work for the sake of saving money. Not allowing AI to be copyrighted or used to train things would safeguard a big section of the American entertainment industry from losing their jobs because of a studio deciding to be cheap.
