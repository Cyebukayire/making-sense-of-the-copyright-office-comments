I am an artist who is deeply concerned with the inherent plagiarism and rampant abuse that AI represents to me and my industry. AI is trained on artists&#39; work, often without their consent or knowledge and without offering compensation, and used to then put those same artists out of work. The plagiarism alone is bad and unethical, but the threat it represents to the industry as a whole by wiping out jobs from individuals and studios alike is even worse. It&#39;s hard enough to support yourself on freelance art without having to compete with people stealing your images and using them to generate &quot;art&quot; without you. Please consider the strictest possible regulations on AI as early as possible in order to protect the people creating art and their work!!
