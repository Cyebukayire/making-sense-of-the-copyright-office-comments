First off, this is not AI and calling it such is inaccurate at best and malicious marketing at worst. These are trend analysis programs that sift through databases to do lots of best fit patterns in a very reductive sense. But these programs are incapable of creation as they must be trained on existing art created by others. Of which these datasets are the majority of the time stealing art from artists into their data sets even after DMCA claims are filed or cease and desists are released. There needs to be an increase in regulation as the implementation of these systems is starting to become more and more wide spread and the data sets are grabbing more copyrighted material without permissions. There needs to be a system of enforcement possible for having the default being to ask the artist for permission to use their work in training sets rather than stealing and the artist having to find the data set with their stolen art and requesting, sometimes unsuccessfully, to have it removed. And enforcement to enforce consequences for the taking of copyrighted material without asking permissions first.
