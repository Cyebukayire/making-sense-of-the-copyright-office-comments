Hello, I believe that AI products should not be copyrighted, as they are not new works but amalgamations of pre-existing works. I also believe that copyrighted works must not be used in AI works - if they are used then the user is in violation of the copyright and should be subjected to penalty as the copyright law indicates. Personally, I view AI products as plagiarism. Thank you.
