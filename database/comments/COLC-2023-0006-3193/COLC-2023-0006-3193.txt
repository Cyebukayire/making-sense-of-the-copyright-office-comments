Al must not be allowed to copyright material that is nothing more than copying/emulating/stealing from the hundreds of millions of pages of human thoughts and creativity. The threat is very real, and this is <br/>opportunity to limit the damage. <br/><br/>There is a quote that all writers (and artists) borrow, and great writers steal, but human Writers never had the opportunity to scrape billions of pages of data and literally steal ideas from countless others on a grand and dangerous scale. AI is theft. Theft of the imagination. Theft of the soul. Theft of the future of humanity. AI can be a useful tool undoubtedly, but the current generation of AI is not a creative one. It is not a human one. It&rsquo;s not one that should be allowed to retain copyrights or ownership of anything. For now, and the future.
