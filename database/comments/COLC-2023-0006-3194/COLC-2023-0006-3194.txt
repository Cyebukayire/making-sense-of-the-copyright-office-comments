The Artificial Intelligence currently in use is, first and foremost; Theft.<br/>It is based on predictive programming and photobashing software. Its entire purpose is to scrape and collect the work of artists, musicians and authors and mash them together in a semi-cohesive manner to make money off the creative efforts of others.<br/>As it currently exists, there is no good-faith use of this technology. <br/>To allow this technology to continue unchecked, as it is currently used, is to legitimize the rampant theft and disregard for the arts and prevent those within those fields from earning a living off their own labors.
