As a writer for television and video games, I deeply need AI regulation from a federal level. This is an issue that crosses state lines and cannot be done locally. AI is digging up resource material via the internet, taking vast amounts of intellectual property it doesn&#39;t own. Art is being stolen. Writing is being stolen. AI is breaking the law. If a human took as much as these programs did, they&#39;d be in jail. It is destroying my colleague&#39;s jobs and doing said job poorly. It&#39;s devaluing human ingenuity and creativity by taking what&#39;s out there and pretending to be of similar value. It&#39;s creating stews of copyrighted material and saying it&#39;s new. People&#39;s identities are being stolen via deep fakes. Likenesses are being owned and replicated, destroying our right to privacy. Our faces are being stored in databases that can be recreated without our permission. Voices are being replicated, destroying voiceover jobs. Lazy, talentless people are exploiting these tools to kill jobs and profit. Bots are spreading fake news via convincing videos with these horrendous tools. This is killing us. This will kill more than just artists, writers, and reporters soon. Please regulate AI before it&#39;s too late.
