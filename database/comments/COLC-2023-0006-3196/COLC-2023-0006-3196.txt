the use of artificial intelligence for commercial and civic means needs to be HEAVILY regulated, very very immediately. AI allows the intellectual property of others to be scraped, stolen, and remixed without any accountability. Not only that, but ai is clunky, impersice, souless, and at times DANGEROUS. AI facial recognition is EXTREMELY FLAWED and has lead to multiple false charges and accusations already. The general publics faith in the legal systems ability to be fair and just is already at an all time low, and the incorporation of ai into police work and court cases is only exacerbating the issue. I know that the vast majority of our leaders do not actually care about what the general public wants, but it wont be long before the copy right issues start pissing off major corporations, so maybe pretend to care a bit at least.
