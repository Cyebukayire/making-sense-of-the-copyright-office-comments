AI is parasitic to art, it removes all passion and subtle reflection of the artist. We look upon old art to see signs of history, each piece showing us a different side of a world we&#39;re struggling to keep alive in memory. AI can&#39;t feel the sadness of loss, the joy of love, and without feeling art is insignificant. We need genuine artists to inspire and progress society, please don&#39;t make it harder to make a living as an artist than it already is, there are plenty of other opportunities for programmers to make a living.
