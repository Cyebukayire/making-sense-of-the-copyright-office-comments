I myself am an independent writer so I&#39;ve been quite concerned about a growing AI presence. I think that any AI algorithm should be required to get explicit, opt in permission from any person or institution if they want to use a work that&#39;s under copyright. It just feels like stealing to know that someone might be using a computer to potentially mimic my work. Artists of all types already struggle to make a reasonable living producing art so an AI that scrapes our work, doesn&#39;t compensate the creators, and then goes on to make a profit is cruel. <br/>My opinion is that it&#39;s fine to sell specifically the use of an AI. That&#39;s just another program and a database. It&#39;s what goes into the database and how that&#39;s my concern. The ai program would be a copyright-able entity and the database it uses would be a separate entity and dependent on what&#39;s inside it. The works that ai creates would be super to the copyright laws of what goes into the database. For example if the database is all public domain works, any output is also public domain. If a database uses works under copyright, the ai output would essentially be under those copyrights as well. I think individuals or companies selling ai services should be required to separate customer databases from the main AI founding database. That way for example if I wanted to use an AI in my art, I could add my writing to a personal database on my computer and know that I&#39;m not essentially paying a company money to use my writing forever in their AI.
