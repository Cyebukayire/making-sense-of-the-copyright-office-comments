The current state of AI-generated art and writing is deeply unjust. We cannot allow massive corporations &amp; studios to push through legislation that absolves them of financially compensating the creators whose work acts as the very foundation of an AI-generated project. Listen to the WGA and SAG strikers. So many were struggling to survive already in an industry that drastically underpaid them for their labor. It&#39;s clear that the studio executives do not care about the livelihood &amp; safety of their workers, they are just hungry for profit and want to use AI as a direct source of unpaid labor.
