With the increment of AI usage, it has come to many the attention of copyright issues. While AI has the potential of being of great function, it seems to be leaning toward a harmful road. The usage of AI has been used to create creative outlets, such as: writing, art, music and homework essays, etc; by modifying various figures/types of styles to create ONE sole piece.<br/>This is quite harmful since it destroys the creativity and hard-work for an individual without giving the credits of their work. I understand that AI does its work by its self, but it does it by COPYING first.<br/>Please take that into notice.
