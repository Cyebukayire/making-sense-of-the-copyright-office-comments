AI content is generated by stealing the work of thousands, if not millions, of artists, writers, voice actors, and other creators. A program&#39;s cannibalizing and regurgitating this stolen content is not the same as a human&#39;s using it as inspiration or learning material. AI must be regulated and artists&#39; copyrights enforced.
