A.I. generated art is intellectual property and artwork being directly used with out artist and/or copyright holder consent. Full stop. Massive databases containing copyrighted IP is being used to create AI artwork.<br/><br/>It is no different than if a musical performer sampled someone else&rsquo;s work and did not credit them. To take their work without their consent is illegal and cannot be subject to copyright protection.<br/><br/>It is not &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; art. The art is often prompted using the name of a specific artist or copy written material- then &ldquo;created using the specific files/images of their work to &ldquo;create&rdquo; something with A.I.<br/><br/>If I took the Mona Lisa, and Starry night, cut them into squares and pasteed them together to look like a Mona Lisa at night &ldquo;original&rdquo;- it would be false. I took peoples work- cut it up, rearranged it, then claimed I &ldquo;made&rdquo; it. It was made using their literal work. I didn&rsquo;t not paint a single thing in that scenario- I rearranged their finished products.<br/><br/>Also- companies like Facebook and adobe are creating a back door to making their own AI databases by having a built in AI function where they are storing people&rsquo;s art for their own AI databases where people cannot opt out- and there is no compensation structure (money) for them if they opt in.
