Taylor Dupree<br/><br/>I am very concerned about the potential implications and affects of AI use with regards to Copyright. Allowing AI created works to be Copyrightable cheapens the entire concept of a Copyright to the point as to make it useless. Copyright exists to protect Intellectual Property and something created by an Artifical Intelligence is not Intellectual Property. In addition, allowing AI generated works to be Copyrighted gives a seal of official approval to the blatant scraping of actual Intellectual Property, that belongs to actual human beings, that these tech companies have been engaging in. You would be saying that it is okay to feed a machine a bunch of information that has been stolen from the actual owners of that information and allow it to extrapolate from their hard work for free. In addition, the potential impacts to working creatives are incalculable. We cannot afford to create an additional financial stressor for an entire demographic of people while we are already dealing with a pandemic, a cost of living crisis, a housing crisis, a wage crisis, devastating climate change, etc. That damages not only the people in that demographic, but our society as a whole. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration
