If AI operators want to continue their work, they not only need to pay for the art they use, but get express permission from the artist to use it in that way, pay them residuals, and give them credit. It&#39;s in everyone&#39;s best interests. If artists have no motivation to create new things, AI art will grow stale and inbred. I&#39;m sure some people would prefer if AI generation didn&#39;t exist at all, but I don&#39;t think it can reasonably be abolished at this point. The next best thing is to make sure everyone is getting a fair cut. On second thought though, we do need to get rid of AI generation in the context of academic papers and informational literature. That is an extremely existential threat to science and research. It&#39;s one thing if a fictional story gets a fact wrong, but if it&#39;s, say, a book on foraging tips, then someone is going to get poisoned.
