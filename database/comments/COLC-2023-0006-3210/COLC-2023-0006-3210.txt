We are already seeing generative AI causing issues in regards to spreading misinformation in classrooms and on social media. Additionally, books are being published with no actual human author which can cause major headaches if it is published under the name of an established author who currently has no recourse for getting the book removed from platforms - as well as potentially having deadly consequences in the case of generative AI foraging books.<br/><br/>A computer does not learn in the way humans do, it doesn&rsquo;t gain and apply knowledge. It is at best advanced applied statistics and when math is applied to words and art without a comprehensive understanding of the topic or concept, what comes out is absolute nonsense. The fact that these AI training models have been trained on copyrighted works without the author or creator&rsquo;s consent shows that these AI companies do not care about the copyright and intellectual property of others and only wish to gain copyright access for AI in order to remove the human element from corporate creative endeavors.<br/><br/>An AI can not be held accountable for the misinformation it spews out. If it cannot bear responsibility for the harm caused by creative misinformation and spreading lies then it should not be granted the same protections as human authorship.
