Artificial intelligence is scrubbing writing from fanfictions sites like Archive of Our Own, Fanfiction.net and Wattpad, you can prove it by inputting prompts with words like Alpha Beta Omega and you&#39;ll get back a porn trop only really found in online fandom spaces. It&#39;s profiting off of works of fanfiction that can only be published if not profited on. It needs to be gotten rid of in the way it is now, burned down to ashes and rebuilt on works bought and paid for by the companies making them rather than uncompensated and unwilling fans.
