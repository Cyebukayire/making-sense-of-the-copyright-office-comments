AI created works are not subject to copyright. The constitution very clearly allows copyright only to individuals &quot;by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&quot; The key term in the copyright clause is &quot;their respective&quot; meaning that neither copyrights nor patents can be assigned to non-entities. Nor are they heritable. As such AI cannot create copy written works legally.
