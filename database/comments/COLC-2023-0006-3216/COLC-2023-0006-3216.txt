AI is easily abusable by corporations.  As people, we&#39;re losing our creative agency more and more as days go on and obtaining and protecting copyright is already difficult as it is in the current landscape.  Considering the sheer volume of absolute junk that&#39;s being generated even today, having our human creative agency further stolen for the sake of cost savings or time savings will only increase the struggles the copyright office and our legal system faces today - even more exponentially than imaginable.  As the technology advances, it will become more and more difficult for federal agencies to enforce and protect people who still choose to be actually creative without relying on generative AI.<br/><br/>Generative AI models have already been irrevocably trained on copyrighted and protected works without the consent of the works owners and rights holders.  Our protections have already been breached.  Generative AI is not a tool when a user claims it to be their own;  The works &quot;creator&quot; has no agency in the product that&#39;s created, there is no effort towards the output.
