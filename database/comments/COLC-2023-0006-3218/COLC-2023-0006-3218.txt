I am a writer. I believe that AI should be held to the same, if not a stronger, standard as traditional copyright. Especially since these technologies are owned by private companies. These are not tech owned by libraries or museums for educating the public. They are owned by tech companies and conglomerates for the purpose of stealing the current creative works of writers, artists and even everyday individuals for the sake of taking jobs from those very people in the near future. Companies should be required to get expressed written permission, pay for use, and explicitly state what the use of materials will be used for. Companies that we use for greater use such as Google, Zoom, and social medial sites should not be allowed to collect this information at all. <br/><br/>I believe that loose regulations around the information that feeds AI technology has and will lead to theft, confusion, and lawsuits/liabilities for people and companies who eventually use the technology. <br/><br/>Fix this today.
