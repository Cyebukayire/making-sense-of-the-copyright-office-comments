Ai gaining popularity and tech companies trying to utilize it in every project, and even studios trying to replace writers all show the very dangerous problem. Ai is not Ai. The current and only models for Ai dont do anything new they dont have feeling or thought, they are a blender that mashes up other peoples work inro a product that doesnt fundamentally understand whatcits making. In any creative medium it is actively stealing others work with no permission and these Ai companies could not care less! Take what happens with Ai voices, a voice is one of the only things that is unique to every person on the planet, and Ai voices are a spit in tbe face to every one of us. These voice Ai models almost exclusively take without permission, look at how they use it on famous people, and even politicians, man it really is kinda scary seeing that people can steal your voice and make you say anythingthey want. Think of the scams, the misinformation, the slander and damage they can do with those its crazy. But its not just voices is it, this logic pervades through all Ai projects can you fathom just how hard it will be to control Ai if we dont nip it in the bud? We have the ability to to this to provide the right laws so Ai can not be copyrighted and cannot take others identities and works. Ai is not transformative Ai is demonstratively bad for us
