Considering that many machine learning (also know as AI) algorithms are trained at least partially on the intellectual property of unaffiliated individuals and there is presently no way to reliably identify or expunge that data in their code, it seems reasonable to avoid granting generated content the same copyright protections as human creations and ideas. There is no intellectual creation that goes into prompting a generating algorithm, which would go against the purpose of intellectual property laws anyways. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that many people have been generating and selling instructional manuals in various fields (such as plant identification and foraging) despite the dangers presented by the algorithm &ldquo;hallucinating&rdquo; information by generating strings of words based on statistical order of connection rather than factual information. This &ldquo;hallucinated&rdquo; information poses a great threat to many Americans who are attempting to educate and better themselves and their lives, and people who intend to profit off of it are dangerous frauds and conmen attempting to benefit from the risk they pose to others in an un-American way.
