I have a lot of concerns about the copyright issues of AI art and writing. Everything I&rsquo;ve seen produced through AI is either implied to be or explicitly stated to be created by filtering through and copying other people&rsquo;s work. Oftentimes, this seems to be done without the knowledge or consent of the artists/writers whose work was used for this. I know of at least a few artists online who publicly stated that they did not want their work used to train AI at all, but I don&rsquo;t know if there are any mechanisms to stop someone from ignoring that statement and using their work for an AI anyway, which is a violation of copyright as I understand it. I would like laws and procedures put in place to either prevent someone&rsquo;s works from being used without their consent, or to redress any violations and compensate people whose works have been used without permission.
