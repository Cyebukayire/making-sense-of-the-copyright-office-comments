I believe that AI should be used only to do jobs that humans CANNOT do (detailed split second calculations) or cannot do SAFELY (scientific analysis of a toxic environment, outer space missions with extremely long &quot;commutes&quot;, etc). <br/>This does NOT include creating art of any kind (writing, acting, drawing, product design, etc) and therefore no copyrighting would be be necessary. <br/>AI is intended to *help* humans, not *replace* them.
