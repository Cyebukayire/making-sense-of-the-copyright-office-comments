Artificial intelligence, in its current form, is largely trained on stolen media from various sites and creators, with blatant disregard for permission to use the stolen media.  Many artists, writers, and other creators do not grant permission to use their works to train algorithms, and those in support of artificial intelligence view it as a way of replacing creators, despite the algorithms merely cobbling together something from existing parts taken from their original creators.  It has reached a point that creators have been forced to use external means of protecting their creations, such as visual artists utilizing the software Glaze to mask their work, which those training artificial intelligence have called &quot;poisoning&quot; the algorithms--all but admitting that they do not bother to contact the creators to use their work.<br/><br/>In its current state, artificial intelligence is little more than a Frankenstein&#39;s monster of parts stolen from other creators.  Those utilizing artificial intelligence tout their &quot;hard work&quot;, when it is little more than feeding a description and stolen content into a program that spits out a hodgepodge for them.  The true hard work is that of the creators who made the content in the first place, pouring hours upon hours into their work only for others to decide &quot;I can do that too&quot; and steal it for selfish purposes.  Artificial intelligence is a blatant mockery of media creation, and can never replace the original creators; &quot;content&quot; produced by artificial intelligence cannot be granted any form of copyright protection, as there is nothing original about it to protect.  To allow &quot;content&quot; produced by these algorithms the safety of copyright only reinforces the belief that the original creators cannot protect their work, and in time it will lead to a severe drought of original content and an upsurge of algorithmic regurgitation.
