AI should be banned against companies and individuals using it to exploit, undermine and steal art, creative works, and improve functions of work without ethical reasoning. AI, if underegulated, has the potential to remove job opportunities for creative and practical skills-sets such as graphic designers, writers, legal professions and more. Do not let greedy corporate pigs get more greedy and allow them to profit even more. America is a huge powerhouse of entertainment, tourism, and money making prowess. If domestic/foreign companies want to use AI for unethical profit, they should be barred from doing so. This should also be extended to the federal and state governments protecting citizens and residents of this country from AI legislation that would put jobs at either a lower pay-premium  or eliminate them entirely.
