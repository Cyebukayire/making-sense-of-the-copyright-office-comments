Ai writing and art is almost entirely comprised of stolen works, sometimes even dropping watermarks onto their generated images. It would be disrespectful to anybody out there actually creating anything legitimate to allow these random generations to be owned and copyrighted. The lines between actual art and generated content would become much harder to cross and devalue any actual work a human being is doing. Also the idea that somebody would copyright something that they themselves by definition CANNOT recreate seems ridiculous to me.
