AI is one of the more important issues of our time, but the current slew of generative AIs are not creating anything. The works that they create use pilfered parts of other texts that have been scraped from a myriad of places on the Internet which infringes on the copyrights of creators across the Internet. If anything can be done to prevent this theft of intellectual property going forward, I would like to contribute my voice to all of the others who would raise concerns over the ethics of their usages. I would urge whoever reads this to qualify, at the least, the content scraping performed as a form of copyright infringement. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.
