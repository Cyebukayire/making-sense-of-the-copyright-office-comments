AI is a tool that could be helpful in areas of science and some workforce automation (with proper limits and not replacements of human workers), but it should not be applied to art. AI is about feeding the correct information to the system and with art, the only way to do that is by stealing people&rsquo;s works to show AI how to make art. AI should not be used in this space. However, if it is, there needs to be safeguards and compensation, especially in Hollywood. Writers and actors should be able to work with AI and not be dominated by it. If AI infringes on copyright, the guilty party should be fined for copyright infringement. It should not be allowed to replace human artists. It needs conditions and when those conditions are violated, fines must be imposed. Technology should be used to improve human lives not replace human livelihoods.
