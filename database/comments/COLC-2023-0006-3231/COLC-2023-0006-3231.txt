&quot;Artificial intelligence,&quot; as it is commonly known, is simply predictive text. An algorithm. There is nothing &quot;intelligent&quot; about it. ChatGPT and the like are built by scraping data and writing from the internet, very often without the original author&#39;s consent. This is, quite simply, theft. And the output of a computer program built on stolen data should not be allowed copyright.
