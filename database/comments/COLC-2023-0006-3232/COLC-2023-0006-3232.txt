I think that AI work should not be considered copyrightable unless the user can verify that every single thing the AI was trained on was already copyrighted by the user. Currently AI trainers trawl artists&#39; galleries and writers&#39; portfolios and steal them for AI training without the artists&#39; consent, effectively stealing their work. The fact that big film studios are looking into using AI to replace actual thinking, creative artists for the purposes of strikebreaking is reprehensible, and it should be made clear to them that this is not a moral or legal option.
