I do not believe AI work, as it stands, should be copyrighted. Our current AI are not truly artificial intelligence--instead, they are statistic models trained on the work of human writers and creators. They are not truly creating something new, merely filling in the blanks when prompted. The copyrighting of AI created materials will see the bankruptcy of human creators, the loss of art as a way of life, and the in-sustainability of our culture. How are we to compete against computer models that are trained on our creations? How are we to be small artists when large business and conglomerates can copyright products made off of our work? How can we fight that? Copyrighting AI creations hurts everyone.
