The question of who owns copyright is one of four options: The person who programed the AI, the person who asked for the art, the AI itself, or no one at all.<br/><br/>Unless the person/people who made the AI made the artwork themselves, then not all of the code or creation of the AI was done by them. They should not be able to hold full copyright using artwork that was not theirs to rightfully use.<br/><br/>The person who asks for the artwork, just putting a prompt into the AI, does nothing. They cannot inherently own the artwork any more than someone who pays commission on artwork now owns it. The copyright of commissioned work still goes to the artist, the one who created it.<br/><br/>The AI itself is not sentient, and therefore cannot create artwork that has copyright any more than a random number generator can. If it were able to think freely, able to have a full and meaningful life, and able to form its own opinions with its own personality, then this topic can be revisited. But at its current stage, it cannot. At this current stage, all the AI does is look at artwork and make similar things. It is not intelligent, it&#39;s an art generator. <br/><br/>Which leaves the fourth option: no one owns the artwork. It automatically goes to public domain. It is unowned and unownable. <br/><br/>This leaves out the most important reason that AI shouldn&#39;t have copyright in this current state: it&#39;s being used as a way to not pay people. Companies want to use AI in order to not pay real breathing human beings for their time, effort, and expertise. We should not, as a government, give them more incentive to not pay Americans a living wage for their work. The dying artist is a meme, but one based in reality - artists are not paid to live with their art. They are held for months on end while only getting paid for  a few days. They are payed royalties for only a few months while the corporations are paid indefinitely. If we want artwork, we need to treat the artists fairly, and AI generated art slaps human artists in the fave, making all their efforts seem worthless and cheap.<br/><br/>There is no good reason for stolen art to be resold as something new. That is all the current AIs do.
