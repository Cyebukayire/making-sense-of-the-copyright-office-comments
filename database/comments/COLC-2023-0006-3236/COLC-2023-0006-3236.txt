Hello, I am a concept artist in the game industry and I am concerned with unregulated generative AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. I have always been interested in developments in technology and science, but tools to &ldquo;make people&rsquo;s lives easier&rdquo; should not steal from them without consent to populate a huge database, a database that is the sole reason for the existence of genAI companies&rsquo; profits.
