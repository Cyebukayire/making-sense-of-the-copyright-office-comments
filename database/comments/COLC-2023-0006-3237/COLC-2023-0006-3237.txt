I believe AI content should NOT be protected by copyright for two reasons. First: Ownership is ambiguous. As of now, all outputs are direct derivatives of other works (including copyrighted works) that are included in their training set. Because AI outputs are made from a collection of artwork and not a singular person, it&#39;s hard to pinpoint who truly owns it. For that practical reason, AI generated work should not be protected by copyright.<br/>Second (and more importantly): AI generated content is generated by an algorithm, not guided by human hand. Outputs, even if generated by key words, are not truly made with intention and deliberation because the output will ultimately be randomized. Randomized content such as AI outputs should not be considered artwork, thus not protected by copyright.
