Any use of an artists work to create new work, without the artists consent and without added creativity by another artist, is plagiarism. The best case understanding of AI image making or text generation --- it should not be called art --- is to consider it like an automated collage. A customer enters key words and is automatically given a collage of other images based on those words. But the customer makes no creative decisions of which images to use or how to use them. They do not even know which images they are using. As such they are not adding new ideas but accepting a semi-randomized combination of the ideas of others. Others who have not consented to their work being used as such and have every right to deny the use of their work under basic copyright law.
