- I don&#39;t believe AI generated art should qualify for copyright on the grounds that it is not produced through human intentionality. <br/>- Intentionality is one of the definitions of what makes art &#39;art&#39;.<br/>- AI as a term tricks the reader/viewer into believing there is thought involved, rather than applied statistical analysis. <br/>- current AI practices involve unethical data scraping from creators and artists who have not decided of their own volition to contribute, therefore it is violating their own inherent copyright.<br/>- Current AI modes of learning favour confirming and then inflating biases in our societies that will continue to perpetuate those myths.<br/>- AI is not ready for this work.  It should not at this stage even be called &#39;Intelligence&#39;, rather it should be called what it actually is: automatic iterative generation.
