Generative AI has proven itself to be nothing more than another way for the upper class to openly STEAL the labor of the American craftsman. Generative AI has no place in business and the continued use of it will only lead to further detriment of the American people. It will completely erode the sense of what is &ldquo;real&rdquo; or not all while trampling critical thinking about art and imagery. I find it insulting, as a specialist in my craft for over a decade, that the entire AI oversight board is made up of individuals and businesses that SELL AI products - that is a flagrant conflict of interest. Please mandate some type of regulations where these plagiarism programs are no longer allowed to siphon up millions of peoples work unbeknownst to them - regulate that you have to OPT IN to be a part of these various datasets AND be compensated for it. Do not put the responsibility onto the VICTIM OF THEFT to tell the business/company that their work shouldn&rsquo;t be included.
