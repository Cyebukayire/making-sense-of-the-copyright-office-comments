I&#39;m very concerned about the threat of AI. I know that many countries have already banned//prevented it from being monetisable and capable of getting copyright or any rights in regard to authorship. That&#39;s a good thing, I don&#39;t think that people, who use/pay for programmes that scrap and steal data from people&#39;s creations mostly without even any request of consent, let alone consent itself, should be able to profit off of that. The method takes no craftsmanship, no skill, no passion, it steals art and scans it searching for patterns - faces, hands, bodies, plantlife - and regurgitates whatever an app thinks that constitutes as; it cannot discern on its own whether something has been made by AI either, hence there is a newly-coined term of artificial intelligence &quot;inbreeding&quot; - where they scrap their own regurgitations instead - making everything look even more nightmarish and uncanny. It&#39;s worth pointing out that this nightmare has no intent behind it and shouldn&#39;t be considered worthy of being labeled as useful for concepts even in horror settings. It&#39;s incapable of learning anything on it&#39;s own, so it is required that it feeds off of others&#39; works. I&#39;m very concerned that if the US would allow for AI to get copyright then it&#39;d cause many countries to struggle with that decision as well; because it would mean that an American could steal work from someone elsewhere in the world, even a continent away, and be able to sell it completely legally. I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be many comments generated by AI for this purpose put in by human hands with very malicious intent, but I hope that the comments of actual artists will be enough to safekeep the divine act of creation from becoming something repulsive, repetitive and quite frankly ridiculous.
