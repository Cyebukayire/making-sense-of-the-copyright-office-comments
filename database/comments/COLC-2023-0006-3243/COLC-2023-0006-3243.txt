As someone who (without AI) writes short stories, novels and draws and paints, AI just collecting works of people like me and using them without their consent and without financial compensation feels extremely intrusive. Furthermore it is ruining the jobs of artists and pushes high quality art out while replacing it with low quality imitations. There need to be strict regulations so that AI does not ruin the art industry.
