I do not live in the US so i&#39;m not sure if my words will be appropriate, but boundaryless AI and lock of regulations on the information it scrapes from the internet is impacting the careers and lives of all. I work in the entertainment industry that is in service to a lot of US companies. Many of my friends have lost their livelihoods because of the impact of the streaming bubble/all of the same things that the unions are striking for in Hollywood&#39;s, and the fact that they want to implement AI more tells me that if we do not regulate it it will ripple throughout the entire entertainment industry. I am pro-technology, and I welcome advancements to tools. But when technology TOOLS are pushed to replace people, we must ask ourselves why they are so &#39;good&#39; (at least on a surface level) , and the reality is they only work how they do because of the endless, countless, innumerable mass of years of peoples hard work. Decades of artists portfolios that they use to get jobs are now scraped to be mimicked and used, is there any surprise that some of these AI creations are impressive ? They are not impressive because they are AI, they are impressive because they are a summery of the artists they have stolen from. We cannot allow AI art to have the ability to be copyrighted, at least not without proper boundaries on where they source their imagery from. Technology has always outpaced regulation, and we can&#39;t undo what has been done already. AI, like many technologies that have evolved careers, is here to stay. It should stay as a tool however, one that should be used ethically and in a way that makes careers and people flourish, not diminish. Thank you.
