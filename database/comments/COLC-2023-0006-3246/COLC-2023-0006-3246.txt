Currently, &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (actually applied statistics as it is not true AI) is a wildly unregulated and untested field. Scraped information from various sources, with or without permission, is being applied with no oversight, resulting in things like foraging books being produced that advise the consumption of highly poisonous fungi and legal documents being created attributing lawyers and cases that don&#39;t exist. We&#39;ve also seen the rise of books compiled using unauthorized scraped data from authors being uploaded to Amazon under that author&#39;s name, falsely claiming this author&#39;s work. We&#39;re already seeing entertainment industries attempting to use it to remove the human element from writing in all forms of media, destroying jobs and livelihoods in favor of pursuing an untested model. The works created with these applied statistics documents have no thought behind them; they are prompts compiled using work scraped from artists and writers and all manner of other individuals, stacked together to create something else using their work. As I am sure you can guess, this has the potential to be incredibly detrimental to the state of creative works and the livelihoods of creatives nationwide. Please consider NOT allowing AI copyright, as it will only continue to prey upon those who already struggle to make ends meet with creative works by scraping the work they&#39;ve already produced for someone else&#39;s gain.
