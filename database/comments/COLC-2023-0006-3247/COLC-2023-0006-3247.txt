I am of the opinion that AI is being touted as the future, but really it&rsquo;s just a new way for companies to squeeze more money out for themselves at the expense of the American people. The plan seems to be to take thousands of years of human endeavors and have a computer recreate pale imitations without compensating actual people for their work. They want to benefit from the work of creatives without having to pay for it. I know some people are stating that the machines are using other people&rsquo;s art as reference but truthfully there are times when you can find the exact pictures the programs used to &ldquo;create &rdquo; the one you&rsquo;re seeing! Why should a person or a company be able to copyright something that they haven&rsquo;t created?
