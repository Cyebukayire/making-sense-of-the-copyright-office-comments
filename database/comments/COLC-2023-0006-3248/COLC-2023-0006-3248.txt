Thank you for this opportunity to submit comments about such an important topic.<br/><br/>I am a concerned citizen and a supporter of writers and artists, and I am bothered by the current practice of AI being trained on copyrighted works.<br/><br/>The Copyright Act allows artists exclusive rights to their works for a limited time, allowing them to promote and profit off of their art. Many smaller writers and artists rely on this ability to monetize and make a living off of their work. So when an AI is trained on writing or artwork without the consent or due compensation of the artists who made them, this constitutes a copyright violation. <br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt the position that training generative AI on copyrighted works, without the consent of the author or artist, constitutes a copyright infringement. Thank you for your consideration.
