AI should not be allowed to copy human artists work in any fashion and since AI can not think for itself, any &quot;art&quot; generated will be from existing human art. Sorry I don&#39;t 100% understand what the public comment is for but the idea that AI can use the likeliness of people is terrifying and having AI generated movie trailers, images for advertising, etc instead of people also feels very wrong.
