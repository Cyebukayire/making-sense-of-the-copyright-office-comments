AI is a terrible infringements on the rights of real humans who do real work. Countless artwork has been stolen on AI generative sites and this has led some companies to use AI instead of providing jobs to real people who need them. As an artist, it is completely disrespectful to even consider giving AI the copyright when the image it produces is composed of many other original pieces created by real human artists.
