As an author and an illustrator, I deeply understand that AI needs to be regulated and controlled. It&rsquo;s theft, plagiarism plain and simple. <br/><br/>Any work with AI should absolutely not be able to be copyrighted- it&rsquo;s not theirs to begin with. The idea the work that went into creating it is not theirs to claim. It&rsquo;s stolen. They shouldn&rsquo;t be able to legally claim it. <br/><br/>And there should be more protections for artist and writers / more legal implications for people plagiarizing creative work through the use of AI <br/><br/>AI does have its use- but it should not be allowed in the creative industry. There is no ethical way ai generated images and books can be created. Because it is plagiarism <br/>
