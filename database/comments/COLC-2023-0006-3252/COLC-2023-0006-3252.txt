I am an American.  I am a voter.  I am an artist, I know artists, and I consume art.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) must not be allowed to use copyrighted material of any form, nor should AI generated art be able to be copyrighted.<br/><br/>Copyright is intended to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts.&quot;  All art, regardless of style, medium, content, or size, is useful.  It sustains us as humans, it brings us together; it teaches, it records our history in real time.  Copyright ensures that an individual creation can be protected so its human creator can continue to create and reap all benefits of their creation.  When human creators are protected, they will continue to produce more art, and more varied art; their art and the society that consumes it will progress.  <br/><br/>In a culture where we are constantly being spoonfed reboots, remakes, and sequel after sequel, it is critical that we increase the variety of art that is available.  If AI is able to take art that is deemed successful, &quot;learn&quot; from it, and regurgitate more of the same, that is not progress, it is not valuable to our culture and society, and those regurgitated products must not be allowed to earn copyright protection.  <br/><br/>Just as we each have our own unique fingerprints, irises, and DNA, so too is art made by human creators unique to each individual creator.  To allow generative AI to rob anyone of that individuality is to rob us of our humanity.  Such a thing would be decidedly un-American.<br/><br/>All Americans (all humans) consume art.  All Americans benefit from art.  All Americans are guaranteed the right to the &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot;, and art, regardless of the form it takes, is a direct contributor to that happiness.  Many would argue, too, that art is critical to those inalienable rights of life and liberty, as well.  All of these are enshrined in our nation&#39;s founding documents.  Art is enshrined in our nation&#39;s founding documents.<br/><br/>I beg you leaders, regardless of party affiliation, as an American voter and artist and cultural consumer:  Protect artists.  Protect creators.  Protect human copyrights.  Do not allow AI to rob us of our very humanity.
