I am a traditionally published novelist who has had my work pirated, and then scraped to train AI. There is very little recourse for this. It undermines the very nature of what I do, and the fact that I am more than happy to teach people about my work and teach people to write--for free. While volunteerism is part of good literary citizenship, theft is not. AI has been trained on work that came directly from my life experiences and is profiting off it. The resulting work, any work generated in my &quot;style&quot; is a pale imitation of what it means to make art, and an abuse of my identity as a writer and artist. At this point, should I choose to use the AI trained on my work, it would require me to pay, and I would see no compensation from the work I made--because it was stolen. AI companies have overall ignored basic copyright already in existence, training on pirated copies of books published in the last 20 years, and want the same protections that they  ignored so cavalierly. This disproportionately harms underprivileged voices in an industry already stacked against them. We are already seeing scammers posting terrible quality AI generated novels to ebook sites under an Author&#39;s name. This is fraud as a direct result of piracy and theft. There must be strong legislation and enforcement against copyright infringement as it applies to Large Language Models and generative AI.
