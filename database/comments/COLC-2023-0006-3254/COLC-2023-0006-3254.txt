Use of AI and training AI on other people&#39;s work and intellectual property or likeness should be far more regulated and compensated accordingly. It&#39;s pretty horrifying as an artist to think that someone can just pick up what you&#39;ve done, feed it to an AI algorithm, and have it spit out something similar and have someone call it your work. Not to mention having your work used to train said AI when you have not been asked nor given compensation. Training AI algorithms on people&#39;s faces, words, voices, art, photos, etc should require significant payment to the owners of said property every time said AI algorithm is used.
