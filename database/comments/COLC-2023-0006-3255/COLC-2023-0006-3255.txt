AI should just be used as an educational tool, not for stealing an actors image for use as an extra.  Acting is an art, not a graphic.  Writing takes REAL intelligence, not artificial.  Writers &amp; actors also are good enough to work very challenging hours to make a show work, giving up time slots that normal people use to spend with family or tending to one&rsquo;s personal life.  Why on earth should they be punished for their talent&rsquo;s &amp; flexibility of time - OR be forced into homelessness?  My suggestion is to stop looking for ways to be cheap and lazy - and chose a moral high ground instead.  You&rsquo;re going to want to be on the right side of history on these issues.  AI won&rsquo;t be writing the history books, the people you hurt will.
