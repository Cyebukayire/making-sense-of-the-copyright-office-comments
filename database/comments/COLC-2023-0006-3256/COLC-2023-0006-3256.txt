The data scraping of the internet and training of AI on copyrighted works are unethical at best and the potential for harm is so high when it comes to AI-generated works (as we are already seeing with AI &ldquo;written&rdquo; foraging books where misinformation has the potential to be deadly). AI doesn&rsquo;t learn, it is advanced applied statistics and it cannot be held responsible for the harm caused by the lies it creates and spreads. If it cannot have accountability it should not receive the same protections as human authorship.<br/><br/>Additionally, corporate interests are trying to remove the human element from creative projects and this is bad not only for creatives (authors, artists, writers, actors) but for the environment as AI requires so many resources to run. <br/><br/>Authors are now having to battle websites that refuse to take down AI-generated books with their names attached to them. Countless numbers of artists and creative individuals who rely on their work are now having it stolen, manipulated, and repackaged to be sold and profited off of by thieves using AI software. Not to mention the untold amounts of misinformation that is being pushed out using AI as well. In the wrong hands, AI is a massive detriment to us all.
