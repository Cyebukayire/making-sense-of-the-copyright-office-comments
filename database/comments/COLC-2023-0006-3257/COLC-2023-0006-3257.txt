Ignoring the fact that the term &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; does not reflect the true nature of these algorithmic programs, these scraped, copied and derivative pieces are not reflective of the submitter&#39;s artistic expression. They are using the work of others to claim ownership of something created by a program, often a program they didn&#39;t even create themselves. Feeding these machines actual human artwork gains nothing, and there would be no good way to claim ownership off something not truly made by the person submitting it for copyright.
