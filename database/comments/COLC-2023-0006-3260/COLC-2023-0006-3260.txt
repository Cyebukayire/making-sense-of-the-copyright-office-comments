On the subject of AI art (inclusive of writing) and copyright, I would be extremely hesitant to afford copyright to the AI creator or the person who wrote the prompt from which AI art was generated. There have been multiple cases I have heard about of individuals and/or corporations blatantly using other people&rsquo;s copyrighted material as prompts or &ldquo;learning material&rdquo; for an AI to generate work from. Because I do not believe AI has the capability to be creative, I see this as effectively plagiarism, and I believe all AI art directly trained off of copyrighted material should be disallowed without the copyright holder&rsquo;s explicit permission. As an artist myself, I am also extremely concerned with the possible future actions of Google and other companies that provide word processing software to use the content of documents or other files for AI training. Even though the contribution of a single piece of art in this case is sure to be much smaller than in the previous, I am extremely wary of possible loopholes in terms of service that may allow this widespread &ldquo;scraping&rdquo; of documents to occur. I believe that in this case, artists should also have to give explicit permission to have their works used for AI, and that this option be presented to the artist up-front (similar to how websites ask to collect cookies). I also think that any AI-generated content made from either method should have to be disclosed to any possible customers, as many (including myself) object strongly to AI-created art and may feel cheated if a product consisting of all or some AI art was not marketed as such (and therefore implied to be original by omission).
