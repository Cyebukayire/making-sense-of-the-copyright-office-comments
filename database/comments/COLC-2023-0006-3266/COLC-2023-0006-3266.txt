Hello, I am a self published author and I am concerned with unregulated A//I because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/>This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse.<br/>Unregulated A//I is a threat because  it is demoralizing to actual writers who work hard to provide real thoughtful and original creations. If A/I is all anyone has to relay on then quality writing will soon become scarce. I will want to write less if I know that at any time my writing could be scraped and put into a database to generate A/I created content. If there are regulations in place this would help authors and writers or written works going forward in these times. <br/>Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense. It would be good practice and something that should be the standard as A/I works do not need to be tools that get in the way of and divide creative communities.
