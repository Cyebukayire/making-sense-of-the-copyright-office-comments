I feel like you cannot copyright something produced by a non-human entity. It&#39;s the same as the monkey-selfie case, the image could not be protected for a non-human entity. I don&#39;t see why the precedent should change for a machine that did arguably less than the animal taking a photo. Mostly because the machine isn&#39;t even making it&#39;s own likeness it is compiling data using (often) illegal means to smash together in an approximation of a story which means it is likely actively stealing from actual people to &quot;create&quot; and as such cannot claim to be the &quot;originator&quot; of a new product as it has created nothing original. There is also the question of do machines have right and how precisely will the exercise them and what would even benefit from such an arrangement. A corporation may use an AI generated script...and if it receives a copyright in the name of the AI the AI cannot actually consent to the corporation using it. Or would it work in a conservator capacity in which case does the inventor of the AI or the owner of the AI have claim to what is produced (once again by dubious means) and who precisely will be sued when it infringes on the human written work that it grabbed data from. Do you sue the machine or the conservator? Can a machine be held accountable for breaking the law (as it is technically it&#39;s own entity) or is the person who programmed it (as we do with hackers) or would it simply be swept under the rug as &quot;code gone rogue&quot;? I really see no good way to even uphold the copyright of a non-human entity particularly one which has no sentience.
