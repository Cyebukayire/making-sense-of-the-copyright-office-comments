It is my belief that anything created with AI should be held to the same or stricter standards of copywrite law as anything created by a human. If an AI is rearranging parts of a preexisting work to create another, the AI should receive express permission from any creator whose work is used, and that creator should be entitled to part of the revenue that work AI-created work generates.
