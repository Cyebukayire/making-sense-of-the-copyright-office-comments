AI work should not be considered for copyright, as doing so would empower large corporations to crush all competition by leveraging their existing catalogs as training data for large language models, granting them the ability to cut out writers, actors, and other workers from the process of creation. Allowing AI generated work to receive copyright would do irreparable damage to every creative industry, and further incentives the widespread horizontal integration seen in the modern entertainment industry, again by empowering those with large catalogs of produced work to churn out hundreds of decent quality work using their existing catalog as training data.<br/><br/>In the case of movie studios, allowing AI-generated work to receive copyright would incentivize predatory relationships between studios and actors, where studios can dictate their right in contracts to endlessly reproduce the image of that actor using AI, generating infinite unique performances using an actor&#39;s likeness like a puppet, and the actor who needs to agree, or they will be stonewalled out of the industry at large.<br/><br/>Allowing the one who generates AI generated work to receive copyright for the output would also empower bad actors, for example by allowing such bad actors to gather the work of an author, generate a book using their work as training data, then publish that book, without compensating the original author. This can already be seen in the online book market on sites like Amazon, which has seen a flood of cases where small authors have their work scraped and resold as an AI generated piece, with their only recourse being that their publisher is able to enforce copywrite against these actors. Without that ability, small authors would have their work immediately stolen and reproduced, starving them of the revenue necessary to continue their work.<br/><br/>I would also warn your office about the possibility of AI-advocates leveraging the technology to flood this commenting interface with a glut of generated AI-positive messages, as it can be difficult to tell at a glance when such a message corresponds to a real person.
