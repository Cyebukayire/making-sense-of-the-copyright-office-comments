I am a hobby writer. I have friends who are also hobby writers and artists, or professional artists. Generative AI can be used to imitate the hard work of artists of all stripes, taking their craft away from them and cheapening all of the hard work one puts into improving and creating. I understand that generative AI has its uses and interesting applications in terms of abstract art and exploring what computers &quot;think,&quot; but most users only care about using them to skip paying a real person for their craft. Please consider regulating the intake of data for generative AI, enforcing rules on consent for data gathering. Generative AI bots have been scraping hobby writer sites like the archive of our own, to which I among many others have not consented to. Disallow the usage of generative AI datasets gathered without consent, and indicate that using generative AI to imitate a SPECIFIC writer, artist, or actor/voice actor is a form of fraud, using tools in your possession to imitate someone&#39;s professional work. I believe that generating specific imitations of an artist of any kind IS fraudulent. It&#39;s mimicking someone&#39;s work and brand for your own benefit. I think that dataset consent and mimicry of specific individuals are two of the biggest problems with generative AI usage as it stands. Please, don&#39;t allow the continued exploitation of artists by generative AI users. Generative AI has promise in certain aspects, but it sorely needs regulation. Thank you.
