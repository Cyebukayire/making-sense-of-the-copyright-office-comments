I am deeply concerned with the ethically dubious nature of Machine and Deep learning software, but will focus my comment on the use of generative &#39;AI&#39; to create artistic images.  Machine learning requires the use of vast quantities of sample data to build the algorithms that will then generate images from text prompts provided by a user.  The sample images used to make the algorithm are scraped from all over the internet and the people who created the source images are not asked for their consent or given any credit, let alone compensation.  <br/>Copyright should only apply to work created by a human being.  There may be an argument that the user of a Generative &#39;AI&#39; platform is in fact a creator in the same way as a human painter would be the creator of a physical painting, but this is absurd on its face.  The person providing a prompt to one of these platforms could generously be thought of as something like an Art Director or Curator, but their role is not functionally and different than if they were commissioning a work of art from a human artist, in which case they would not be credited as an artist.  Simply put, the user of an &#39;AI&#39; platform is not an artist or creator.  If there is an art involved at all it would be the &#39;AI&#39; itself.  And since the &#39;AI&#39; is not a human being and should not be thought of as such, there should be no legal protections applied to &#39;AI&#39; generated images.<br/>Going a step further, I do not believe that any legal protections should apply to these images even if a human is involved with changing the image.  For example, if an image is created and needs to be retouched by a human artist afterwards it should not then be considered human-made and thus acceptable to receive a copyright.  While there is likely a point where the image can be considered human made rather than &#39;AI&#39; generated, that point should require a significant transformation of the work in question.<br/>A last point, that may go beyond the scope of the copyright issue itself, would be to point out that companies that profit from these &#39;AI&#39; platforms are doing so on the back of work they have effectively stolen, having not asked for consent or provided any credit or compensation to the original creators.  They even go out of their way to only train their algorithms on only human generated art as &#39;AI&#39; being trained on &#39;AI&#39; art would quickly create a feedback loop that would severely limit the functionality of the algorithms.  It is my firm belief that these companies owe the creators compensation on profits already made and should be forced to remove training images from these algorithms unless they acquire consent from the artists, regardless of whether the &#39;AI&#39; images themselves can be copywritten.
