It&rsquo;s a rough situation. There are thousands of creators who didn&rsquo;t consent to their work being rummaged through and looked at by any AI&mdash; who would then take it and reuse it for themselves. It&rsquo;s somewhat of a copyright infringement issue when that occurs&mdash; no AI should be able to steal other peoples works or ideas. However, this is mainly an issue within writing communities. I full hearted believe it is wrong, and not beneficial.
