I don&#39;t believe that things generated by an AI should be copyrightable because the idea of a copyright is in place to protect the creative expression of an idea. An AI cannot be creative as it lacks sentience and humanity. Therefore, AI generated work cannot be copyrighted, as there is not a creative expression of an idea.
