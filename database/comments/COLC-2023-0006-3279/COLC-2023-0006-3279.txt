I am strongly against copyritten works being used to train AI without the express permission of the copyright holder. It is by no means the same as an artist viewing another artist&#39;s work and being inspired by that work because AI isn&#39;t viewing a work and then being inspired to go and make its own thing from a combination of that work and AI&#39;s own experiences/ideas. Instead, AI permanently stores the works it samples and then uses them to guide how the machine learning algorithm functions, a wholly different &quot;inspiration&quot; process. If I were to copy-paste another&#39;s work into a thing I created, that would rightfully be called plagiarism and that is what AI is doing. While the content it spits out may not be plagiarism on the surface, the content it creates is only created because of all the stolen work that was inputted into the program. This is wildly unethical. <br/><br/>If someone were to make a video game and we discovered that they had stolen the code from another developer and just changed the dialogue options and graphics, that would still be called plagiarism because the base code belongs to the original owner(s). AI is no different, it&#39;s just dressed up fancier because it has so many stolen works to pull from. If I can say &quot;copy author X&#39;s style and write me a story&quot; and author X is not in the public domain and author X has not given permission for their work to be used, then stolen work is being used in the program. Same goes for painting pictures or any other form of artificial content creation.<br/><br/>AI must be required to only use public domain content or content that they have been granted rights to. Anything else is in blatant disregard of the spirit and intent of copyright.
