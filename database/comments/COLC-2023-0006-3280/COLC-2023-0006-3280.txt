&quot;AI&quot; models, including text-based LLMs and image generation models, must be restricted from using copyrighted material in their training datasets without the consent of the copyright holder. These models could not exist without the massive theft of intellectual property they engage in, for profit, and resell as if it was their own product. The US Copyright Office must do everything in its power to enforce the illegallity of these models, and deny any claim that their outputs can be copyrightable material.
