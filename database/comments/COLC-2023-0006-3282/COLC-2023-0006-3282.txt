AI creations shouldn&#39;t be legal to copyright or own, because the entirety of the work is simply taken from others work. There&#39;s nothing original about it, nor nothing about the use of the initial artwork that would fall under fair use. Furthermore, the idea of a copyright exists to protect the rights of human creators and their rights to their creations. Since the extent of work from the human standpoint that goes into &#39;creating&#39; something using an AI is simply typing in a prompt and possibly picking the best fitting result, an AI work is no more the property of a person than a child the property of its grandparents. The computer programming does the vast majority of the work, which would make the creation the AI&#39;s property. Since programs have no legal rights(and nor should they as the concept of AI stands), AI art cannot be owned and therefore should not be copyright-able.
