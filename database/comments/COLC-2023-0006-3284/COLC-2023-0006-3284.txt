In the field of animation, art, writing, and entertainment in general, there is no place for AI. AI cannot create on its own, only reference what it THINKS it knows. And that has made it hard to discern what is actually good and to what looks it sounds coherent. In the advent of AI sampling other AI, which has happened, they will no be able to make actual sound works. Nor can they claim those works as their own because they do not porcess free will and creativity. Until an AI can prove itself feee and independent enough to make its own work, regulation of the science and tech must continue to be monitored and examined. Until then, AI has no real place in the world of arts and entertainment. Not without the sacrifices that these artists have paid, in no small part thanks to the government allow work abuse or many many type to occur and be inflicted on those who have suffered. In the shortness breath, this individual does not support AI in this industry and believes no Copyright protections should be given to that which doesn&rsquo;t even have its own human rights. Not now at least.
