Hello, I am an artist living in Pennsylvania and I am concerned with unregulated A//I because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/><br/>This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. Unregulated AI is a threat because it destroys the livelihood of existing artists, writers, actors, and voiceover talent by stealing from preexisting works without credit to make something else, effectively plagiarizing the original work. If theft of objects is considered a crime in the United States, then the theft of art, writings, and voices should be considered crimes as well. If the use of unregulated AI were to continue, especially with larger media companies, the rates of unemployment would skyrocket, leading to a severe impact on the economy of the United States.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
