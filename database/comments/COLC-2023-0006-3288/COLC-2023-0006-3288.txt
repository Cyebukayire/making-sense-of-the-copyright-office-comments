Adobe Firefly Stock Contributors have expressly not given consent and there is a mass misinformation campaign that Adobe Firefly stock is indeed legally trained, which is not true.<br/>Artists not consenting to their works being trained, sources: https://twitter.com/Kelly_McKernan/status/1667322946325557249<br/>https://www.creativebloq.com/news/adobe-copyright-ai<br/> https://venturebeat.com/ai/adobe-stock-creators-arent-happy-with-firefly-the-companys-commercially-safe-gen-ai-tool/<br/>https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2023/06/adobe-contributors-express-dismay-over.html<br/>Mass Misinformation Campaign, sources: https://adobe.design/stories/leading-design/how-adobe-design-is-shaping-the-firefly-gen-ai-experience<br/>https://www.smartcompany.com.au/technology/emerging-technology/adobe-created-ai-platform-without-stealing-artists-work/<br/>https://www.8awake.com/adobe-firefly-empowering-all-creative-tools-with-ai/<br/>---<br/>Mr. Ben Brooks never stated an Opt-In form for any of their training data, however states a request to Opt-Out from their database.<br/> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoCJun7gkbA\<br/>If such a system is allowed where people enter contracts without  ever singing into one or any knowledge of it ever existing, this is a huge problem, especially because, anyone can be signed into any contract without knowledge or express consent, or entered into a contract where they have no choice because it is an essential service for them to use, e.g. Microsoft Work Account where the Work Account Admin has power over the Employee. Individuals are signed into a contract without any consent, permission, have no rights to their private property, meaning, anyone could be entered into a contract without having the knowledge of such a contract even existing.<br/>Adobe Products are current Industry Standard for creating Digital Art, therefore it is an essential commodity for Digital Artists, however, the contract, site terms are being misused to obtain the creators&#39; works by predatory contract terms, especially methods of default Opt-In data training, offering Opt-Out is meaningless as the data will have already been trained upon by the time artists are able to manually Opt-Out.<br/>The artist retains all rights under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 USC Section 101) as the sole author of the work for the duration of the copyright. The duration of copyright in the United States is currently the life of the author, plus 70 years. <br/>Title to the artwork passes to the client or commissioning agency/organization upon their written acceptance of and payment for the work, but copyright belongs to and remains with the artist. In other words, although the client may &ldquo;own&rdquo; the work of art, the artist who created the work owns the copyright, including all ways in which that artwork is represented (photos, video, ads, logos, branding), other than in situ (on-site documentation photos). Artists may wish to register their copyright with the federal government. For more information on copyright, refer to Public Art Network&rsquo;s Best Practices Guidelines<br/>Every stroke entered into the software is being tracked and used as training data without knowledge or consent.<br/>Why should there be an Opt-Out option when there was no option to Opt-In in the first place? No proper permissions, consent was taken from the individuals.<br/>Personally identifiable images are being misused and have been shared on social media:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/561833229312771<br/>There is no clear transparency on the database: https://haveibeentrained.com/<br/>I have a work account and there is no option for me to edit my privacy settings, I do not consent my voice to be entered as training data, I do not trust my voice to be used in any way or form, there is no option for me to Opt-Out: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-does-microsoft-protect-my-privacy-while-improving-its-speech-recognition-technology-f465d7a7-4a4f-40b7-9441-f0e6e97e24ec<br/>--<br/>Schumer&#39;s AI Senate forum consists of only the panel of the exploiters rather than the exploited, no artist, no creator in the panel, only those who predated upon creators&#39; rights. I want to ask you, is this fair representation?<br/>
