I am simply one person without significant financial stake in art, but as n appreciator and consumer of art, I have concerns about the work of artists being co-opted for some unknown third party&#39;s profits that the art&#39;s original creators will see none of.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that the data used to train generative AI should be art that is either in the public domain or that the entity training the AI model owns the IP rights to.  Art may be available for licensing, in which the training entity pays the artist for the rights to use specific art pieces in the data set, but a contract must be drawn up in which the AI-training entity cannot use the same data set indefinitely.  The person or company using the AI to generate images will only have the same rights to those images as they would have if they hired the artist to make them and the artist whose work was used to train the AI retains some rights to the content the machine produces.  It would be treated as if the machine&#39;s product were a commissioned work from the artist or artists who provided the material it was trained on.
