I strongly believe that AI developers should not be allowed to use copyrighted or copyrightable materials to train their AI programs without explicit permission. AI generated articles, books, and art should be required to have a prominently displayed notice that they were AI generated. Lawyers should not be permitted to use AI to generate briefs, memos, etc. as that is not what their clients are paying for, and as shown in the case out of the southern district of New York, it encourages bad behavior. Personally, I would prefer to be given an option to disengage from any AI elements.
