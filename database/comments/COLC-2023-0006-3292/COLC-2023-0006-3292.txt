Copyright coverage for AI-generated works legitimizes the unauthorized use of scraped internet materials--themselves used in violation of copyright--retroactively. It further means that any materials so generated can be used to eliminate the positions of the people who initially created said content at the corporate level. Creatives, having had their work stolen and used without consent, will be replaced by algorithms trained on their own stolen data. The situation is set to be dire enough anyway; extending copyright to the creations of generative AI would be ruinous.
