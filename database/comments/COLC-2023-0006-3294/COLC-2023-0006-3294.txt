AI art breaks the copyright laws the moment it includes works whose creators didn&#39;t agree to being a part of the learning model. Considering how hard it&#39;d be to properly filter the ones that do this, it&#39;s safe to assume that /most/ AI art is art theft and copyright infringement. It would be impossible to effectively stop people from scrapping the Web, and unreasonable to expect artists to stop posting their art online - its also a portfolio for them, after all. AI anything should not hold any copyright because there wasn&#39;t any actual thought being put behind the result - the closest thing to a thought in the process is the programmer inputting specific prompts. AI itself cannot think or consciously create anything, it just follows a strictly coded algorithm; neutral network simulates &quot;thinking&quot; but its still far from it. If someone were to take 4 paintings by Picasso and, cut them into several pieces, and then glue them together - would they hold a copyright to the amalgamation of someone else&#39;s work? Just because they modified it without their permission, or credit? And the programmer shouldn&#39;t own the copyright either - they may hold copyright to the lines of code that create the model, but they&#39;re not creating the &quot;art&quot; either. Just inserting prompts. At most, they can be assumed the creator of a splatter of words like &quot;gray sky cyberpunk buildings neon lights heavy rain dramatic setting&quot;. I think its important to appreciate real art, and protect artists. There&#39;s no thought, intricacy, or intention behind AI creations, and so they should be public domain.
