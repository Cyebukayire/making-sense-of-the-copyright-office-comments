Some people argue that AI prompt bots work exactly like a human. There&#39;s nothing original under the sun, new stories and art are an amalgamation of influences the creator has already consumed. AI cannot create new content. It has to rely on example pieces to draw from. Then it blends things until the human operating the program is satisfied. Again, this isn&#39;t too dissimilar from what humans do. But there&#39;s two things wrong with that. Firstly, if I read a story and I&#39;m inspired by it, I can&#39;t just rewrite it with a few edits and publish it as my own work without incurring legal consequences. Why should a person using an AI app be free from those same consequences? Secondly, if I create art that depicts something unethical, I as a human have to use my sense of morality to decide whether to show others. Already AI has been used to fabricate nude pictures of women that are nearly indistinguishable from reality. And there have been pedophiles using it to do the same with children. A computer program does not have the sense of morality that humans do. To allow people to continue using these programs that have no failsafe, no way to prevent copyrighted material from being used without knowledge or permission leads down a dark path. I don&#39;t think the technology should be banned outright, it can be useful. But there have to be ways to prevent it from being used without the consent of the either the creators or the living subjects being fed into the prompt algorithm. And it needs to be clearly labeled as AI produced. It&#39;s hard enough for artists to make a living wage, competing with programs will limit and prevent so many prolific artists from creating.
