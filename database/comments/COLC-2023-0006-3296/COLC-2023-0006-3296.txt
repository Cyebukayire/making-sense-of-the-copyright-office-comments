ai and copyright scares me as an artist. i&rsquo;ve barely gotten my foot in the door in the art world and now ai might shove me and others out entirely. it feels incredibly wrong to try to copyright an &ldquo;art&rdquo; piece ai made. it&rsquo;s like trying to copyright multiple peoples work. it feels messed up. ai is also just scary in knowing what&rsquo;s real or not. the amount of misinformation that could sound like it came from a credible source, is a scary thought. it&rsquo;s dangerous. people are also using ai to make explicit photos and videos of people without their consent. it&rsquo;s disgusting and traumatizing. somehow there&rsquo;s a new way to violate people and their bodies. ai could be a great tool, but right now with no regulations or rules or anything, people are using it for the wrong reasons. this feels like the first big step into a crazy future we thought of as kids, but take a wrong turn and we might go further into this dystopia. it&rsquo;s a scary time.
