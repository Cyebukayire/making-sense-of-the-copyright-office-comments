AI that uses art/writing scraped from the internet without consent from or compensation to the artist is akin to theft. I am a programmer in game design; AI is an important aspect of my work. However, before this, I was an artist and a writer. I have spent as many hours on a creative work as I have on a program. I, and other artists, should not have to hesitate sharing our work for fear of it being stolen by some generative AI program without our permission. This is especially true for artists who make their living off of their hard work. Unchecked, AI has the capacity to make irrelevant the more than 2 million American artists in the workforce (figure from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). AI that is permitted to scrape human work off of the internet without permission or compensation is piracy, and it needs to be regulated.
