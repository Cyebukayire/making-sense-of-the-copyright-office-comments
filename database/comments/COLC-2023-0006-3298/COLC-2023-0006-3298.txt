Any work, text, story, photograph, or image, created by Artificial Intelligence should not be copyright admissible. AI generated content cannot be copyright material because AI needs to plagiarize or &ldquo;train&rdquo; using previously created material by which to generate its own content. Furthermore, if AI generated content is allow to be copyrighted, thousands of lawsuits will follow because other, similar, or following AI algorithms will generate content similar to or identical. It will be impossible for the Court System to prioritize one claimant over the others.
