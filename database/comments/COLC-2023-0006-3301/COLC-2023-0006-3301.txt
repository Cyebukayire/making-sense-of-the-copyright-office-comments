AI should NOT be allowed to train from copyrighted material, nor should work created by or through the use of AI be protected by copyright laws. AI is a dangerous tool, and will only become more dangerous over time as it progresses. People are having their voices stolen and used without their consent, including the president and other influential political leaders which could easily be used to stir up all kinds of controversy. Art is being robbed and copied to train AI models, which is completely unfair to those who have actually spent their life training to become good at what they do, unlike those who use AI. Artificial Intelligence is dangerous to humanity, and regulations or outright bans should be put in place to protect us from the dangers of it.
