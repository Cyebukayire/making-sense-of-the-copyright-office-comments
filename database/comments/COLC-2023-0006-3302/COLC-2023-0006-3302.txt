As a citizen, I feel strongly that AI models should be legally barred from using intellectual property as training data without express written legal permission from the intellectual property owner.<br/><br/>I also feel that deep fakes should be illegal as I believe that private individuals should own their own likeness under the law and as such their permission must be obtained before such a rendering can be made. I do not feel that any clause in the terms of use agreement could possibly constitute such permission as such an agreement would fall outside the bounds of activities conducted through the use of such programs. I also feel that permission must be requested each time such a rendering is created.
