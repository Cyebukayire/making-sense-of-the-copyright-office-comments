To whom it may concern, <br/><br/>I am an artist currently getting her degree in children&#39;s book writing and illustration. Making books for children has been all I&#39;ve wanted to do for years, ever since I first read Goodnight Moon, and I desperatly want to be able to make a living in this field. However, I already have several pages of my work online as samples for prospective clients. In order to get work, I need these samples online to show people what they might get if they choose to work with me. However, this also leaves me completly open to copying through AI, and makes me afraid that people won&#39;t even think to hire me, the person--instead, they&#39;ll simply reconstitute my artworks without paying me. <br/><br/>I think that artists and authors should be able to withdraw consent from these AI programs, and that programs like these should only draw from open-source non-copyright work. Otherwise I fear that artists like me will not be helped by this, as it is designed for, but instead harmed. <br/><br/>Thank you for your concern-<br/>E.E.
