I am an artist (primarily hobbyist, though I am beginning to get into professional work in the academic field) in North Carolina. AI art is deeply harmful to artists, and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. It is a threat to the livelihoods of many people - those who are valued and praised for their creative and artistic abilities will be seen as replaceable cogs in the machine. The purpose of having artists on a team is to bring soul to the work - something that simply isn&#39;t present in AI art because AI is unable to replicate the human touch needed for high-quality pieces. People can see when a company is using AI for their art, and it looks TERRIBLE - anatomical errors, lighting mistakes, compositional issues, and more are all abound in AI generated art. People go to school for years to learn these basic fundamentals and AI tramples all over them, not to mention the fact that it steals the hard work of an unknown amount of artists to churn out poor quality work. ANYONE can learn to draw given time - they can pick up a pen and paper and learn just like every other artist has. Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
