I&rsquo;m a professional writer in journalism and video games.<br/><br/>I have spent a year watching AI&rsquo;s impact on the video game world. I&rsquo;ve spoken with artists, writers, musicians, actors, and other artists whose work was poured into large datasets to make generative AI possible. (I have not investigated, but as a journalist producing massive amounts of text that can be scraped off the internet, my own writing may be among them).<br/><br/>I have concluded that this technology must be strictly regulated, and copyright of works created by generative AI either heavily scrutinized or denied outright. At the heart of the issue is this: generative AI creative work only exists by violating the copyright of other creatives&mdash;all in the purpose of creating a simulacrum or creative work, not the honest thing.<br/><br/>This may occur in subtle or explicit ways. A subtle way would be if a LLM like the one employed by ChatGPT scraped my text into its model, and used the data from my writing to author say, a journalistic article at a competitor of mine. That competitor would ask ChatGPT to write an article on a topic, and in a narrow field like mine, said article may only be possible if the LLM weighs text outcomes against my writing.<br/><br/>Then there are more explicit examples. Artists monitoring the output of Midjourney have spotted their personal signatures manifesting in a ghostly form on &ldquo;art&rdquo; created by the software. There are certain types of artistry AI is able to mimic easier than others&mdash;see, all of the Wes Anderson AI ripoffs. His distinctive style, protected by copyright, can be fed into an AI model to produce uncanny near-resemblances.<br/><br/>At the heart of these issues is the data sitting under AI tools. Much of the data used by Midjourney, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and more was not gathered with the consent of their creators. Many of these datasets were gathered under academic provisions for copyright rules, and then flipped for commercial purposes.<br/><br/>For that reason, creative works generated by AI risk violating copyright just by existing. They make for an amusing parlour trick if posted on social media, but if they are protected under copyright, they will undermine the hard labor of artists as we know it.<br/><br/>I am not a zealot against &ldquo;AI&rdquo; (which is not even intelligent&mdash;the name is a branding effort). I use otter.ai to transcribe interviews, then write stories using the transcript. Game developers use AI to test their games for bugs. An artist may experiment with procedural tools to shape art in a way we could not in real life. I acknowledge the lines of authorship are not always super clear.<br/><br/>But! For that reason it is important that the copyright office strive to protect work authored without generative AI. It will be better for all involved if we know where the boundaries of copyright are, so AI developers may build better tools that can serve creatives and tradespeople, and creatives can know their work will not be stolen and used for someone else&rsquo;s profitable copyright.<br/><br/>American arts and culture are among of our greatest treasures&mdash;they enrich our people&rsquo;s lives, bring us together, and introduce us to the world. Many generative AI developers want to make that art without putting in the work, so they can profit off of the tools. Such a world would degrade us as a people.<br/><br/>So please&mdash;help us out here. Copyright is a flawed but functional system. Make it work for the people it was made for, not machines that don&rsquo;t even know what they are making.
