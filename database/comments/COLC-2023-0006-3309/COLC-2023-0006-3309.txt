I don&rsquo;t believe AI should be used to create copyrighted material. Material created by AI should be ineligible for copyright protection. For example, if AI is used to produce a script,  that script should not be considered intellectual property because it would not be a human&rsquo;s original, creative work by definition. While some may argue that AI are a tool to create IP, like a paintbrush or a word processing program, this is not a true comparison because AI can only generate or regenerate outputs based on other IP; there is no creativity involved. The training of AI is also problematic for the same reason, as the outputs produced by AI are amalgamations of copyrighted material, often without the consent of the owners of that copyrighted material.
