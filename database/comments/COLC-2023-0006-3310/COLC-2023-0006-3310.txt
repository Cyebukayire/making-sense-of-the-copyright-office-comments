It is my honest and complete opinion that the use of AI, specifically in the practice of training such AI with the independent and pre-existing work of writers, authors, and artists, is a disgusting violation of those creators&rsquo; rights to their work, and must be stopped immediately. As someone who themself does not publish any artwork in any medium but rather greatly enjoys the hard work of those who do, I have the utmost respect for these individuals and do not wish to see their further exploitation at the hands of those who intend to develop AI, especially for the purpose of making those creators obsolete. A profit motive should not be pushing real human people out of the fields where they express themselves and earn their living. I deeply recommend that you remember that these are people being harmed by the scraping of their work in order to &ldquo;train&rdquo; AI. Thank you for your time and consideration.
