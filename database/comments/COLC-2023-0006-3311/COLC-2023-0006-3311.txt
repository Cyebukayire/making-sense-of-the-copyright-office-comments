I am a television writer, producer, and showrunner and I am vehemently opposed to the incursion of AI into our industry. As a Guild I think we should sign a pledge not to use this tool, which is nothing more than a plagiarism machine. As an industry, we should go to war over the fact these machines are using our work, our art, to train themselves. It&#39;s theft. It&#39;s plagiarism. It&#39;s copyright infringement. And we need to put a stop to it ASAP before it is too late. Hollywood has been a beacon of American industry and culture. We can not let it be coopted by greedy and craven companies who want to take human talent out of entertainment. Thanks for your time, and I look forward to seeing what actions you take on this existential issue.
