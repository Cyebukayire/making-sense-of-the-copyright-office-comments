AI &quot;works&quot; should never be granted copyright. They themselves are amalgamations of other works. They are mangled chimeras of the blood, sweat, and tears of real human beings. Granting any AI &quot;works&quot; a copyright would be to spit at, slap, and insult every human creator who has ever had their work copied unwittingly and/or unwillingly by the grubs of the art world who seak to create these abominations. AI &quot;works&quot; go against everything copyright stands for. Protecting it would be to protect intellectual thieves.
