AI is an incredibly useful tool for automating many processes and workflows which are tedious or uncomfortable for a person to carry out. Where AI falls short is it&rsquo;s lack of ability to create meaningful, expressive, artistic pursuits such as writing, visual art, animation, and music. Due to the generative nature of AI, these tools can only create by first analyzing and stealing from existing works, modifying the result. While parts of this process mirror how human artists create, studying master works and practicing for many years to build observational and technical skills, the result from a human artist is one which is produced from a place of expression and feeling. A person can own the copyright to their own work because their work is a product of their labor. A tool, such as AI, cannot own the copyright to their work as it requires exploitation of others labor to produce results. AI can be useful in many areas of business, finance, and technology, but it must be highly regulated in the realms of literature and the arts.
