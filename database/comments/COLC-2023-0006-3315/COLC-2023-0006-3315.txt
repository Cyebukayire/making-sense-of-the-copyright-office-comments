It is my firm belief that AI generated content is non-copyright-able material, as the vast majority of what is produced is in and of itself a copyright violation. A vast majority of popular AI generators are known to have neither been trained on material that was submitted or generated with the purpose of training an algorithm, nor been trained on material that the original creators have given permission to utilize.<br/><br/>This is one of many points that there are to make on this subject, but this is the one that I feel I am best able to articulate in regards to copyright policy.
