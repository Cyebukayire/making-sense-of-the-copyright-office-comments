listen, I feel like AI &quot;art&quot; the death of the meaningful art - visual or otherwise. Because art is supposed to be a person taking a part of their soul and trying - however clumsily- to share it with other people, hoping against hope that it resonates with someone - ANYONE. Art is a human cry of &quot;I was here! I lived a live of love and misery and joy! Can you hear me? Will you listen? I was alive! I was alive!&quot; And I just feel that if AI &quot;art&quot; is left to run the tracks that are laid out it will start to eat at our culture and humanity in a way we might not be able to come back from. I can&#39;t remember where I heard it but I am reminded of something I read in response to AI &quot;art&quot; (I&#39;m going to be paraphrasing because I cannot remember the exact wording) during the indusrial revolution people saw automation as a huge step towards machines and robots taking over labor intensive and undesirable jobs leaving the days and nights open for humans to create music and paintings and books and pottery. Why instead are humans working longer and longer hours while computers are given the joy of creation? Does this not seem backwards? Well, there&#39;s this guy on Twitter (oh, so sorry, X) who sometimes uses ai to create images that are riddles or brainteasers, and like, while he could commission someone to make those for him I think ai is justified there because he already did 90% of the creative process there by writing the riddle. So I&#39;m not saying destroy the AI engines altogether, im just saying there needs to be a leash. AI (and I&#39;m not even going to touch the fact that AI is a misnomer because it&#39;s not an intelligent being, it does not have independent thoughts free from our commands) should be a single paintbrush in the hands of an artist. Not the artist themselves, given a directive or commission and left to create the full idea.
