AI works should not be eligible for the same copyright protections. The way AI works is to use existing datasets and extrapolate new ones. In the case of visual art, this is pre-existing work by artists who were unlikely to have been asked if they wanted to be included in the dataset. The same goes for AI generated text. A non-human entity is generating content based on pre-existing work. We shouldn&#39;t be beholden to copyright claims made on behalf of machines. Copyright protections are intended to protect IP and allow space for creativity and growth under that safety net. This would simply be abuse of that safety net.
