AI art uses pre existing art to generate supposedly &quot;new&quot; content, despite the fact that it needs images to be input in order to generate a new image, often without the original artist&#39;s permission or even credit. Other types of AI generated media follow this similar path. It is, therefore, within reason that any AI media cannot be copyrighted, even if it has been edited by a living person. It would take significant editing to make it it&#39;s own identity in order to avoid plagiarism, defeating the whole purpose of using AI.
