Anything made by Artificial Intelligence, be it written or visual, is made off the work of others. Thusly, it makes anything crafted by A.I a product of stolen effort. <br/>Creatives put time and effort into their works. Often, these are deeply personal works that these people have given others the privilege of viewing. Creatives only ask for their works to be appreciated - and not stolen. <br/><br/>A.I can be used to create, but it needs regulations. As is, there is no telling where these A.I. bots are being taught and who&#39;s works were used to influence them. Creatives who do not agree to having their work - their property - used to train these bots; and are unknowingly being stolen from. There should be safeguards in place to protect. Companies should have to ask permission before adding a work to their bots learning system; they also should be transparent in where they are finding their resources. <br/><br/>I myself am a creator, a visual artist. My craft took years to get where it is now and still needs to improve, but I can not share my works in fear of them being taken and I have no recourse. If I agree to sell my labor it is one thing, but that isn&#39;t what is happening. <br/><br/>As it stands right now. A.I. is theft.
