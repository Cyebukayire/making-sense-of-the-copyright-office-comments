AI is a threat primarily to artists. Allowing it to be used unchecked (especially by corporations) would negatively impact the livelihood of independent artists. AI art created via machine learning takes the work and property of artists without their consent. While the AI work is &quot;transformative,&quot; it is also in direct competition with the work/art/likeness it is drawn from and thus could be considered copyright infringement and the entities who feed original content into an algorithm absolutely should not be able to claim a copyright on AI works.
