If an AI user has legal rights to all materials used to train an AI algorithm, either through licensing those works, being their original creator, or other means that would allow them to use that image, there should be no question that they can copyright those images - they have done nothing different than if they had created a physical machine that produced the work of art. In cases where the AI user has trained on other data sets, its unclear to me (a lay person with some technical training) why there is a difference between this area of law and if I trained myself to imitate another artist&#39;s style - if I&#39;ve physically created my own work in the style of someone else, I can copyright that, even if my work is indistinguishable (although not a direct copy). How would usage of an AI to do this be different? As long as the original work is not recreated, what is the boundary? If the argument is about the usage of those works - how does fair use factor in? There are carve outs there for usages that involve teaching and education, which is not different than training an AI algorithm.
