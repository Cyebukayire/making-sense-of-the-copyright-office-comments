I can only describe AI &quot;art&quot; as plagiarism. AI &quot;artists&quot; profit off of the hard work of real people while giving them nothing in return. If university professors do not grant their students a passing grade for stolen papers, we should not grant AI &quot;artists&quot; copyright for their generated prompts. I believe that AI can prove itself useful in various scenarios, but right now AI &quot;art&quot; is not ethical. We need to place legal restrictions on art-generating AIs. They should not have free access to all art uploaded on the internet. Instead, their databases should consist only of works by artists who have consented (and/or who have received monetary compensation) to having their pieces used by the AI. Less artists would feel uneasy about art-generating AIs if they had a say over whether the AIs could use their work.
