As an artist, it is very concerning to me to think that a machine learning program can produce an amalgamation of others works, taken without permission, and upon replicating the patterns that it interprets as correct, give ownership to a third party individual. Whether the interpretation of the program constitutes anything close to the interpretation a human mind goes through to create a new piece of media or information, the third party that gains ownership of the resulting product had less to do with its creation that any one of the works sampled to produce it. Additionally, because there is no compensation made, either to the source works, or to the program itself, ownership is given without consent by any party (other than potentially the writers of the code that interprets the patterns). Giving the end product less of a legitimate connection of ownership than a friend who buys an artist a sandwich in exchange for a doodle.
