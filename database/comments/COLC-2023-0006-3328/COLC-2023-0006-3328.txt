Copy wright should belong to the creator of a work. A.I. creations are essentially sophisticated collages made by machines, so no copy wright should be granted to humans using those machines to create things. <br/><br/>As a teacher, if a student hands in an essay created by an A.I., but with their name on it, it clearly does not reflect their ability, and subsequently the essay would recieve a failing grade. Even in the unlikely scenario that the essay was topical and insightful it justly would still grant the student a fail, as whatever insight it may offer wouldn&#39;t belong to the student submitting the paper. In the caae of A.I. images and art, in as much as A.I.s aren&#39;t persons, the things A.I. creates should belong to no one. Given than A.I. are trained on art that both belongs to an indicidual artist and to the memory and mind of the general public, the creations made by A.I. should belong to people, as memories, dreams and ideas do belong to people, without the entanglements of legal copy wright. A.I. imaged typicaly shows us dreamy, surreal vistas and landscapes, or twisted nightmare humans with the incorrect number of fingers. This is  indicating on a deeper level that the things it makes belong to our culture&#39;s shared dreamworld, and not to the heady fields of finance, economics and copy wright.
