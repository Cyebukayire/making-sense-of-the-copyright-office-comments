The unchecked proliferation of AI-generated content poses a grave threat to the principles of copyright protection. As these algorithms churn out works that often mimic human creativity, they undermine the efforts of genuine artists and creators who invest their time, skill, and passion into producing original content. This copyright abuse by AI not only devalues the concept of intellectual property but also erodes the incentive for human artists to innovate, ultimately stifling the very essence of artistic expression that copyright laws were designed to safeguard. And without artists generating new works, AI will ensure that its adopters are stuck at a moment in time or are unable to progress in a quick manner.
