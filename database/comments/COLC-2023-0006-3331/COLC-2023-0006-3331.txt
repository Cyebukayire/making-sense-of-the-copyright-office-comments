AI trained on models from in-copyright works without permission and/or compensation is copyright theft plain and simple. Models should only be created from public domain material unless permission and compensation is agreed to by the original copyright-holder. And living authors and artists who have work they have otherwise allowed to be public domain should specifically have to opt in to allowing AI to use their materials. <br/><br/>I also do not think AI output should be copyrightable because it is not work created by a human being. It is inherently derivitive because it is a computer compositing bits and pieces of pre-existing work according to algorithims, not a human being taking inspiration from their forbearers.
