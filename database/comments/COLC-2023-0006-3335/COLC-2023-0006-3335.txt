I firmly believe that the use of any &quot;AI&quot; system as it currently exists is an infringement of copyright law as almost all AI programs currently accessible were trained on media that was taken without the consent or even knowledge of the creators of the media. I also believe that AI is an incredible danger to the environment and the slowing of global warming due to the sheer amount of water it uses and the carbon emissions it produces.
