Humans can make things, humans can copyright the things they make. A machine can make things, but a machine can&#39;t copyright the things it makes. <br/>So is AI a human or a machine? If it&#39;s human it needs rights, if it&#39;s a machine it doesn&#39;t. <br/>So do AIs have the right to refuse work? Can an AI go on a vacation and enjoy it? Will an AI be happier if it is paid for it&#39;s work? <br/>No. It&#39;s a machine.  It can&#39;t copyright anything.
