I believe the Copyright Office should continue to reject AI creations as copyrightable. Artificial Intelligence as we know it isn&#39;t actually intelligence, it aggregates data from sources, usually without their permission, and spits out approximations. It is not creating anything. What people are using it for is a shortcut to get around hiring actual creators for their writing, artistry, or other skills. Continuing to push back against AI proponents will only benefit us as a society in the long run. AI art is not real art. It is not creating art. It is not a person, it is computer code and processing taking a guess and making mediocre facsimiles with no soul.
