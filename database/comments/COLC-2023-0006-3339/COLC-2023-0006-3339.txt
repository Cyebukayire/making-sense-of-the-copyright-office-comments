Any &quot;creative&quot; work generated by AI is not creative, it is generative. It doesn&#39;t know or understand anything about art or music or the creative process; it&#39;s simply regurgitating a crude average based on the prompt it&#39;s given. I consider it a moral obligation of any creative to staunchly oppose the practice of generating creative works using neural networks (AI).<br/>Beyond personal moral objections, though, the rise of AI spells certain doom for every creative industry. At a time when multiple strikes are ongoing precisely because of the lack of financial recompensation for creative works, allowing studios to effectively generate free art whenever they want will not only ruin the lives of entire swaths of the population, but it will also infinitely decrease the quality and aesthetic value of any works that use AI.<br/>I recently graduated college with a digital design and interactive media degree. I can&#39;t find a job because of all the layoffs in my industry. I don&#39;t want to have to compete with AI. Do the right thing, please.
