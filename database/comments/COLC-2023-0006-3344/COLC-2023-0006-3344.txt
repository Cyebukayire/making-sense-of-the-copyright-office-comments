IA kills creative thinking in idividuals, why imangine or think when a computer can do it for you. The rise in IA marks the begining of the end of human intellectual advancement. IA should be highly monitored and restricted, and in no way should being given any autonomy or rights. Its not as if the &quot;Terminator&quot; or &quot;The Matrix&quot; will happen but that is not to say they couldn&#39;t happen on some level. The rise of IA looks a lot like the supression of humans in one way or another; weather it creativity, thought, or even personal desisions that effect how we live our own lives.
