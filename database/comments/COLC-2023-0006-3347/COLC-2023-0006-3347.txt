I strongly believe that all human-made works must be protected in regards to AI, unless the creator explicitly gives permission for said material to be used. The current state of AI and the way it is being used is destroying something that is intrinsic to human nature: creativity. We are nothing without are art, and art is nothing without soul... Something that AI lacks.
