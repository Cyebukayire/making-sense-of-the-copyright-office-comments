Hello, I am an amateur writer who has used a number of online platforms to publish my work. <br/><br/>My issue with AI comes specifically from the training resources that AI bots use to program their algorithms. Thousands if not hundreds of thousands of writers have had their words scraped from the internet without permission and scoured for data to feed the machine. Every output by AI, then, is nothing but stolen goods cobbled together to form the impression of a new idea. <br/><br/>This is not the same as a human taking inspiration from another&#39;s work to create something new. First, humans have their own lived experience to draw from that shapes their work beyond what inspires them. Second, the servers running AI programs still pale in comparison to the processing abilities of a human brain. They are entirely reliant on the data they were fed, and the connections they can make between textual possibilities barely sniffs the human capacity to sync up ideas into something wholely different and unique. <br/><br/>What this means is that there is nothing truely new being produced by AI. It&#39;s a regurgitation of what has come before, a MadLibs that pulls on others&#39; talent without permission.<br/><br/>Further, the tech companies are rewriting copywrite law to fit their needs, creating an environment where no creator owns their own creation. If every word produced by humanity is free game to the tech companies who hide behind terms of service agreements on their publishing platforms, then we are beholden to a monopoly of a few big players, a techocracy where, unless we are writing our words by hand and distributing them on physical pieces of paper, we have no right to our own creations.<br/><br/>This needs to be nipped in the bud now before we live in a future where no creator owns their content.<br/><br/>Thank you.
