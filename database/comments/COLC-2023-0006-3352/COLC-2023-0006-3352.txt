I believe that AI tools might prove to be a fruitful exploration in art and human expression and I would not like to see these tools barred from commercial use. Ultimately the question of whether or not a particular use of AI tools is transformative enough to qualify as something new can only be a subjective judgement, and it is one that will have to be made by someone. I do not know how the problem of scale in relation to those judgements can be solved.<br/><br/>In regards to training data used to generate these AI tools, I believe that as long as the data was sourced from the public Internet and the sources were posted with the rights to do so, than it was legitimately obtained. If I create an image and post it online there is a reasonable expectation that I do not have control over what others do with that image, and the same goes for text or music, as long as they are not passing it off as their own creation.
