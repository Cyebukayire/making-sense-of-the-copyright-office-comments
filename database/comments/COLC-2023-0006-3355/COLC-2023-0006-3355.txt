I am a small-time artist who has never made any money off of my work and has occasionally posted my art online to display my progress as I practice and gradually improve my skills. At the current time, any company can simply look at all of my work and use it to train an algorithm, then create an infinite number of derivative works in mere minutes based on my style, while not paying me a cent. <br/><br/>This technology has great potential to aid consumers and artists alike, but at the moment there are absolutely no protections for artists and the systems in place allow for the undercutting of entire fields of business by creating a work-around allowing for businesses to create unlimited derivative works without paying the creators on whose works their AI trained a cent, or even asking permission to harvest data. Until some means of protecting artists from those who would abuse this technology are put in place, it must not be allowed to be copywritten. Doing otherwise will result in a collapse in the quality of art, written and otherwise, as artists are forced out of their only field of work and AI exclusively trains on other AI technology and degenerates in quality.
