I believe that all copyrighted images that were scraped for AI were done illegally. No company or industry should get a special deal to skirt copyright. We need to enforce copyright to protect jobs. Without it, we are no longer a democracy. You must choose humans over corporations. You must choose humans over technology. And AI should not be copyrightable. It&rsquo;s nothing but data, whereas human creativity is the zenith of what we are capable of. That must be cherished and protected.
