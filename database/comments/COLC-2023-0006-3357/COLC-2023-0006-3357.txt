Thank you for opening this issue up for public comment. It&rsquo;s a very critical issue for many that are currently in the art industry.<br/><br/>I am an artist, I post my works online and on my website. They are copyrighted. I have seen many of my peers copyrighted works being taken from them without consent to train AI models, to emulate their work.<br/><br/>Under the Copyright Act, artists have exclusive rights to their work for a duration of time before it becomes public domain. This is to allow them time to profit on their work, and use that work for however they see fit. It should mean, then, that by using copyrighted work without getting a license from the copyright holder, and using that work to train a model to emulate the work of the copyrighter, you have stolen the artwork. This cannot be allowed. <br/><br/>Plenty of works are currently in the public domain, those should be exclusively what is allowed to train AI artwork engines. Should an artist with copyright give consent to a company to use selected works to train a model, that is within their right as the copyright holder.<br/><br/>When these works are used without consent, and without notice to any of these artists, it is an act of theft. When these engines emulate our art, it is an attempt to remove the artist from the transaction. The models themselves require the intellectual property of the artists in order to function. <br/><br/>Even if the company producing this art (that is made without consent of the copyright holder) is doing so for free, it is still taking revenue from those creators. Getting an artwork for free from an AI engine trained on an artists work, as opposed to paying for a commission from that artist to get an artwork, is taking from their revenue. <br/><br/>As I said before, there are plenty of works that are in the public domain, and are available for use. There are a number of artists willing to allow their work to be used in an AI engine&mdash; with compensation, and consent. It shouldn&rsquo;t be legal to allow companies to skip paying the artist for their copyrighted works.<br/><br/>Thank you again for your time, and for allowing the public to comment on this.<br/><br/>
