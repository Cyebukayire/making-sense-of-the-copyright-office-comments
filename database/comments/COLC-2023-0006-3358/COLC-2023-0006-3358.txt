Hello, I am a writer living in Massachusetts and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods of so many writers out there. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. For centuries, people have written books and poetry and plays and screenplays that have made an impact on so many lives, and to threaten so much art with unregulated scraping of people&#39;s work is, frankly, terrifying. Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
