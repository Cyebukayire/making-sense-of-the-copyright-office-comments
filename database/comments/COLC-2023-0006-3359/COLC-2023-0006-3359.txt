AI work should not be copywritable. Use of an AI to create, extensively modify, or begin a creative process should nullify the copywrite of the end result.  <br/><br/>An outline or script created by an AI, even if touched up by humans afterwards, should not be copywritable as it is not the creative work of humans. <br/><br/>Use of an AI to slightly modify or polish a result could be viable, but any use of AI in production should be marked.<br/><br/>All works that utilize AI in their creation in any capacity should be clearly labeled as such.  This should be very clearly visable on all marketing, sales, and display platforms.  It would be in the best interest to be able to discern between mild, moderate, extensive, and sole use of AI for production, but all should be clearly marked.<br/><br/>The only thing about AI that could be considered original is the code that was used to develop the software and any original works that were fed into it for it to learn from.  Any output from the AI, even if only using original works to feed it, is the uncopywritable production of the machine. <br/><br/>The use of unauthorized original works to feed AI datasets should be considered theft and/or impersonation depending on intended use.
