The pervasive growth of AI use in what are intended to be creative fields has caused said fields to stagnate or be over saturated with results generated by said programs, none of which are lawfully created. Because of the nature of AI generated products being &ldquo;trained&rdquo; on pre-existing work, the results of these generations fundamentally violate copyright law, as no permission is granted legally by the original creators the programs scrape for material to duplicate. Because &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; is a misnomer for this process- there is no true intelligence, only statistics running a randomizer based on odds put into the program- this should also expand to include terminology such as &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;, &ldquo;probability generated works&rdquo;, etc. Resources scraped by said programs also frequently include a vast amount of information from existing franchises in such a manner that there&rsquo;s no proper checks and balances and little paper trail, gathered and fed to the programs illegally, for which they must be held accountable. Machine-based resource gathering for creative works both image- and writing-based must therefore be considered a violation of copyright law when sold as a product, put forth for commission, or otherwise used for profit or marketing purposes.
