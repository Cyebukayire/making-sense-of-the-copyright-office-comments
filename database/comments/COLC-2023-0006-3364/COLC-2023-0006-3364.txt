Artificial Intelligence (AI) cannot be copyrighted for two reasons: 1- it isn&rsquo;t made by a human being. <br/>And 2- it is not an original creation. <br/>The first point is self explanatory. There is zero human creation in AI and therefore, it is not &ldquo;art&rdquo; in any definition of that term. <br/><br/>The second reason however, is more potent. An AI program does not create. It plagiarizes. It combs through a search of multiple data points, and mushes them together to generate a plausible point within the set. It essentially steals other people&rsquo;s work, and averages it. <br/><br/>If I stole 4 iPhones, took them apart, and built one iPhone with the parts, I didn&rsquo;t create anything new. I just stole 4 iPhones. <br/><br/>AI cannot create. It can only steal
