Hello, good day. I comment on this post as a way to give my personal opinion on AI Intelligence and Work. AI in how its currently made, is fed already existing work in order for it to make a proper product. However, the work that its fed is, most of the not, not authorised by the creator of it in the first place. This can lead to copyright infringement, as aspects of an AI generated piece of work can be derived from copyrighted work, which is copyright infringement, as its not  crediting the original images, rather passing it at their own original work. <br/><br/>Besides potential copyright infringements, the artwork itself is not made by a human, rather by the AI software itself. Its different from a human using a software to create or edit images, as the human is using their own skills and hand to create the final project, rather than with most AI Image generators, such as OpenAI and Midjourney, the human is not using their skills to create the final product. Its the AI thats generating the image for them. Which, in relation with my previous point, can infringe on already copyrighted material because its fed images to create a new image, like a collage.<br/><br/>While I myself, do not currently recide in the US, the loosening of these laws can affect my future career, as well as the careers of current artists and writers, as people falsely pass their AI generated art and writing as their own creation, which fools the audience on how the product is made. It can also erase spots in the job market, as companies will try to replace workers with AI. This can not only affect the workers, but the audience of people watching as well, as they will not be fed carefuly crafted stories; rather regurgitated words and visuals that are based off stolen work.
