My work has been used to train these artificial intelligence systems without my consent. As an independent artist, I do not think this should be allowed without my permission. It does not seem like fair use to use artists&#39; work without permission or compensation as part of a commercial for-profit product which directly competes with their work product. How can this be considered fair use if it puts them out of work? Ideally, the purpose of copyright is to protect artists from exactly this type of scenario -- being competed against using their own work at below cost in order to undercut them and put them out of business. Much like piracy, these systems rely on artists&#39; produced work in order to function, so it&#39;s a bad idea to let them put artists out of work. Thank you for your consideration.
