5. New legislation is absolutely needed to clarify the positions of creators, AI developers, and AI users. Creators should be protected from having their work used against their will, and those who use AI to generate works should understand that they are not to be considered creators and the generated material is not copyrightable.<br/>8. It seems clear to me that use of copyrighted works to train AI is never fair use. Creators should be compensated for the use of their works. Precisely how datasets are collected and ingested into the AI is largely irrelevant; while this type of use is novel in that the AI is not directly reproducing or redistributing the work, the work is still clearly being used to the advantage of the AI&#39;s owner. As such, the creator of the work should certainly be entitled to the fruits of their labor, or indeed to refuse permission for their work to be used by another in this way.<br/>9. An author creating a catalog of artworks would never expect to be allowed to include any copyrighted art they wished to unless an artist contacted them to opt out of inclusion. The same principle should apply here; the AI&#39;s creator should be barred from using any copyrighted work unless its creator opts in for this use.<br/>9.1. Since it is practically impossible to determine which parts of a generated work came from which training data, allowing the training of non-commercial AI on copyrighted works opens the door to too many abuses. For example: suppose an artist&#39;s copyrighted work is used to train an image-generating AI for educational purposes. A user of that AI generates an image, then turns around and uses it for commercial purposes. It would be difficult to notice this user&#39;s violation in the first place, and even more difficult to demonstrate their liability. As such, the copyright holder should be protected against being placed in this position at all. Consent should be required to train AI on any copyrighted work for any purpose.<br/>9.3. Frankly, I don&#39;t accept &quot;it&#39;s too hard&quot; as an excuse for ignoring the rights of creators. If getting permission is too much trouble, then the AI trainers should rely on public domain works. (If this encourages large companies to push for reduced copyright durations, all the better.)<br/>9.5. No, the copyright holder should be allowed to use the work however they see fit.<br/>15. Yes, an artist should be able to check whether a given model or dataset contains their work.<br/>15.1. The name or pseudonym of the creator, the title or comparable identifying feature of the work (e.g. original filename), the source from which it was acquired (e.g. web address), date of collection.<br/>15.2. The information should be publically available.<br/>15.3. The developer should clearly indicate the source of the AI model so that an artist can confirm that they gave permission for their work to be used in the model. In addition, the developer should retain and disclose a copy of the records which were used to train the version of the AI model they are using. Otherwise the creator has to track down the disclosure from the third party, which may have gone on to a new version incorporating different training data, or they might have removed the model (and disclosure) from availability entirely.<br/>16. Acquiring permission to use it should be sufficient. However, I foresee issues where a popular platform such as DeviantArt could change their terms of service to include the use of all material on the service for training AI. Platforms should be required to actively inform all users that their work is being made available for training, not just slip it into a Terms of Service update. It is important for this to be more clearly communicated than most TOS changes because once a copyrighted work has been ingested, it may be difficult or impossible to remove it from the model.<br/>18. I see very little difference between works created by AI and works created by animals. In fact, the animal may have a stronger claim to creativity. Crafting a prompt is absolutely not a creative endeavor, any more than a Google search query is a copyrightable work. It &quot;creates&quot; nothing, it merely queries an existing body of work for a specific result. Unlike artistic endeavors like collage, it involves no deliberation in the selection of which features to put where, but merely relies on an automated system to make all the choices while the user merely approves or disapproves the result.<br/>20. Legal protection for AI-generated material is undesirable. It discourages AI users from commissioning art from human creators and seems to place a machine on the same level as an active, engaged creator.<br/>27. Some artists have started to use AI to fill in background details around conventionally illustrated subjects. I believe this should be adequately handled under existing copyright law, assuming the artist&#39;s additions are sufficient to consider the work &quot;transformed&quot; and therefore copyrightable.
