I think without restriction the art, voice, and writing generators will hurt a lot of people and their livelihoods. I think it is fundamentally wrong to use people&#39;s work or likeness or voice based on contracts written BEFORE this technology was available, this was not what they signed up for. If people give explicit permission to allow their work to go into one of these AI generators, then I don&#39;t see a problem. But what seems to be the case right now is that everyone&#39;s work is going into the AI generators without consent. These guidelines need to be clear and to the point, so people can protect their work from this as much as possible. I can&#39;t stop people from putting their own work into these generators and producing work with them and I don&#39;t see the appeal of art made this way, but as long as they&#39;re not putting artwork into their generators taken from someone else without their permission I don&#39;t see an issue with that legally. But there has to be a way to protect artists and writers and actors and anyone who&#39;s likeness or work will be put through these generators to make soulless copies of all their hard work. The likeness and voicework is especially goulish in this age of misinformation, a lot of harm could be done with this if we&#39;re not careful. It&#39;s very easy even now to make it sound like someone said something that they didn&#39;t.
