To be concise, my opinion is that algorithmically generated content (popularly referred to as &quot;AI&quot;) should be uncopyrightable and essentially assets of the public domain, unless significant human alterations have been made to the generated content. So far as I can see, that&#39;s the only defense we have against this Pandora&#39;s box that&#39;s been opened. Generative images have harmed visual artists&#39; livelihoods, and generated text not only threatens writers, it has harmed our access to factual information and threatens the very future of our decendents&#39; intelligence.
