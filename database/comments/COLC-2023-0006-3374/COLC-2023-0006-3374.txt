I am concerned that generative AI programs are inherently unethical in terms of copyright, as they have been trained on data that contains copyrighted material used without permission (e.g. AI images created with Getty watermarks). I also think corporations should not be able to unethically use copyrighted material, in the form of AI, to put writers, actors, visual artists, etc. out of work; nor should the creations of AI programs be eligible for copyright protections after essentially stealing copyrighted material. (I also think copyright should [continue to] be restricted to human beings, but that is a separate argument.)
