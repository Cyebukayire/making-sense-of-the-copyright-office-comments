It is imperative that regulations protect individual creators right not to have their work reproduced without their permission or compensation. New AI platforms that generate &quot;new&quot; works can not do so without first ingesting and capturing the content of thousands or millions of other creative works. These machines are not intelligent, they are imitative. They do not originate, they generate copies of original work in remixed forms, but they are copies nonetheless. Without that initial capture of human creative writing, photos, video and audio recordings, the learning algorithms and neural nets could not generate a single pixel of content. Companies that do so for profit, like OpenAI conducted this capture of original works in secret to create their algorithms, then discarded the data because they knew it would likely violate the rights of the original authors and rights holders. <br/><br/>It is critical that new legislation be built on three parameters that are already in use with general data protection:<br/>Transparency: AIs must fully disclose the foundational data they use for training generative mechanisms<br/>Consent: AIs must allow, with clear notice, any author or rights holder to refuse the inclusion of their intellectual property in a data set<br/>Compensation: AIs must show a clear and fair path of compensation for rights holders data as it is used in any and all generative activity
