Humans have a habit of making scientific leaps because it&rsquo;s possible, not because it&rsquo;s best for humanity. We need regulations around AI and the protection of human art. Writing and creating are inherently done from the soul. AI has no soul or experience as a human and so has no care for other humans or empathizing with the trial of being alive. It will create what sells, not what makes us feel. Major corporations do not need more money at the expense of the arts, the one thing free to create and consume for all of us.
