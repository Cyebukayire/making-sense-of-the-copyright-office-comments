Hi. I&#39;m a screenwriter and novelist. After seeing how painters are having their artworks and style completely stolen to produce mockups of their work, I have seen the light when it comes to my career. Artificial intelligence will be the death knell of the career artist and it will be done my companies who are using the original copyrighted works. We cannot allow Silicon Valley to rob artists of their agency, because while we may be amongst the first threatened, we will certainly not be the last. Lawyers, accountants, managers, analysts, politicians, entrepreneurs, engineers, designers will all have their work stolen from them and blended into forms that are obviously derived from their work. But worse yet, the short term thinking of investors and wall street see only opportunity here. Meanwhile, they will be making the world demonstratively worse by empowering these companies and their software to rob humanity of creativity. I urge our government to act by making sure that nothing that is AI generated can ever be copywritten. This cannot go unchecked.
