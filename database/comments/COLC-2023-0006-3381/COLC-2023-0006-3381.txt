I really do not think that AI shouldn&#39;t be copyrighted. AI Art is able to be produced by stealing other people&#39;s hard work to make the art. And I don&#39;t think I even need to say anything about why AI shouldn&#39;t replace actual writers and actors. AI produced things are not as good as human made things and they never will be. AI can be used for good things but I would not like for it to be used for art, writing, acting etc.
