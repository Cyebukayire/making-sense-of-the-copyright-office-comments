I do not believe that AI art should be allowed to have copyright as it uses other people&#39;s work to fuel its process. These individuals do not get credit nor fair compensation for the use of their livelihood while other&#39;s profit off of their efforts. If AI art is allowed copyright, only a minuet set of people will gain off the backs of everyone else, the consequence of which makes EVERYONE much poorer than before. Small time artists will have an even greater hurdle to get their work noticed, and some even take down their work publicly in fear that AI will take their work unfairly so another can use it however they wish, which is already happening on art websites like Artstation, a site considered a professional space to those in the industry. For larger companies, they&#39;ll use AI art to minimize costs in an attempt to gain more profits on returns. This will not happen as they&#39;ll produce decreasing quality work that&#39;ll ruin their own standards, plummeting value across the board. If AI art gets the ability to copyright, we all lose.
