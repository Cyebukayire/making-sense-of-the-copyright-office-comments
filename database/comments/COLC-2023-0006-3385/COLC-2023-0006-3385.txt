My comment is in regards to AI generating artwork. AI is currently stealing Artist&#39;s style, technique, and execution in mere seconds. The speed of the technology is alarming, and it&#39;s probably already too late to regulate. But something has to be done NOW. I am an artist, and I have used the app Midjourney to try and see what it can do. I&#39;m alarmed, and intrigued by the possibilities of the artwork it can generate, but overall know this is for sure going to eliminate so many jobs from real artists who worked a lifetime to develop their style. Their technique is being stolen by anyone who can write a prompt. It&#39;s going to change the art world, and will eventually become a useful tool to many. But regulations must be put in place to help protect the intellectual property of original artists. I believe something that may help, is requiring the companies&#39; application such as Midjourney, OpenArt, NightCafe, Dall-e, HotPot, etc. to not allow a prompt to specifically call out &quot;in the style of (artist)&quot; unless that artist has given their permission to be referenced. If an artist does give permission, they should receive a commission yearly for allowing their artwork to be referenced in this way. The same should hold true for individuals using a photo of their artwork as part of a prompt. It should also be applied to people&#39;s likeness. People of note, such as actors or models, should be allowed the same ability to Opt Out of having their image used in artwork generated by AI for use in commercial ventures.
