I think AI can very easily infringe on people&#39;s copyright and there needs to be restrictions on using copyrighted works to feed into generative AI.  Permission and compensation should be requirements for that.  And there should be better infrastructure to protect smaller artists from their work being infringed on. Furthermore the aspects of a work that is generated by AI deserve no copyright protection as the computer is outputting it and copyright should only protect people&#39;s original works.  In hybrid instances only the human contribution to a piece should be considered copyrightable.
