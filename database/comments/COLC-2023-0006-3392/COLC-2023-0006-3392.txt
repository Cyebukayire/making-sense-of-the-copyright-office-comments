For more than five years, I have been pursuing this battle without success. I&#39;m proposing a novel approach to Artificial Intelligence: Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence. <br/><br/>Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence is an AI that constantly repays the knowledge it uses. This knowledge is not only what has been traditionally protected by copyright.  It is also the unaware knowledge produced by workers. These workers are donating it to AI machines that will then use it to replace them in many tasks. Indeed, workers such as doctors, professional translators, journalists, novel writers, illustrators, and so on are producing training data for AI, and then, AI kicks them off the job market, making their profession old and useless. <br/><br/>This is a very big challenge and I hope some of you have the time to go through my paper:<br/>https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11345<br/>or to visit the website of the project proposal:<br/>https://sites.google.com/view/hitai<br/><br/>I have lost hope but, maybe, you and your institution can be the right place where these seeds can develop.<br/>
