Law is something that needs to be clearly defined, and I think there is a way to make AI copyright law rock-solid.  A company may only copyright AI generated material if they own the copyright to every piece of material used to train the model - including the algorithm.  AI should be allowed in production processes and to make certain jobs easier, but should not be used at scale to replace human works.  Nor should unethically sourced algorithms be allowed to provide copyrighted material.<br/><br/>I think laws should go a step further too, and require disclosure on the sale of an item if AI was used to generate a significant portion of it.  The same with advertisements and articles in accredited spaces, a disclaimer should be applied when AI provided materials are used.  This is likely separate from what you are considering, but just in case, I felt it important to mention.  Buyers will be tricked by booksellers, ads, and products created with minimal human effort, but packaged to look like something they are not.  This is already happening with online booksellers.<br/><br/>There should be ethical ways to create inspired work, and to eliminate redundant jobs through AI.  But these methods cannot include third party algorithms that were created using content indiscriminately stolen from the internet.  Companies need to prove that the ones providing the algorithm materials are being properly paid, credited, and are aware of the terms of use for their work supplied.  This allows AI copyright terms to comply with the terms already existing for creative content today.
