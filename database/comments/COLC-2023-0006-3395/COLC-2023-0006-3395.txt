Generative AI, whether as large language models or diffusion models or any other statistical models which ingest and &#39;summarize&#39; prior creative works, does not produce creative work of its own. While useful in many cases, these tools do not have an understanding of their inputs or outputs, do not have motivation or intrinsic purpose, or other qualities that could categorize them as minds at all equivalent to humans&#39;. They should not gain the copyright protections that are in place to encourage human beings to gain commercial benefit from their contributions to arts and sciences.<br/><br/>Imagine that a person wrote computer code to automate the production of nearly infinite combinations of notes on a musical scale or words in a dictionary or pixels in an image. The output of that code could not, itself, be covered by copyright as it would not be a creative work, and would effectively monopolize copyright from that point forward if it were allowed to. While such a computer program would be inefficient and take vast computing powers and storage space, there&#39;s little difference between current generative &#39;AI&#39; tools that refine the process of discarding the garbage output.<br/><br/>Because these tools are able to automate so much so quickly, there&#39;s little to differentiate them from the random-sample scenario, especially when it comes to its potential economic effects. Granting copyright to the owners of these generated works would allow a small slice of special business interests having the computational resources to apply to it to monopolize the market for creative work and the arts, providing vast economic benefit to them, but not to the economy and people on the whole.<br/><br/>What gives this effect extra moral dubiousness is that these models are &#39;trained&#39; on vast amounts of copyrighted works, often without permission of the owners of these works. In training, these models ingest those works and use mathematical models to extract a statistical &#39;essence&#39; of the input without needing to store the exact, uncompressed data of a work. In traditional copyright determinations, I understand that creation of an exact duplicate of a work is not even necessary to be considered a violation of someone&#39;s copyright on that work as long as it could affect the market for the same. These statistical models merely automate the plagiarism and obfuscate the output with computational complexity, but ultimately are no different than an unauthorized remix.<br/><br/>Does generative AI have a place and legitimate use? Yes. But it should fall within the existing confines of the copyright system, including the need for explicit authorization of the use of training data by those that create the source works and a system to be able to track the contribution of ingested works for potential distribution of royalties if so negotiated. The key consideration, which has already been identified correctly by the Copyright Office, is whether a human mind has created a new work or sufficiently transformed their materials so as to qualify as a new work. A graphic designer using a photo manipulation tool to piece together a collage of royalty-free stock photos or AI-generated source images is the same: the copyright of the inputs does not and should not belong to the graphic designer.<br/><br/>In summary: &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; is not intelligence, training on copyrighted works without authorization is plagiarism, and the output of these models is not creative in the sense that copyright should be granted.
