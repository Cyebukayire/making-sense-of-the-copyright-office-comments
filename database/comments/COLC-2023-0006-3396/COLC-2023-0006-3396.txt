While AI is a great tool in theory it has thousands of copyrighted pieces in its scraped data. Companies are threatening to replace already underpayed artists. We need to make sure AI generated materials can not be copyrighted or at least public domain. If possible only models trained on creative commons and public domain images and/or requirements to compensate to artists.
