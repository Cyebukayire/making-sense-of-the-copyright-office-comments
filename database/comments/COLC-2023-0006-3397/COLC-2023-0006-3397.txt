I believe AI could be a very valuable tool in the future, but before that can happen there needs to be regulations. AI, specifically AI art programs, are stealing art from independent creators and using it fuel their algorithms without the original creators&#39; knowledge or consent. There needs to be regulations to ensure that this cannot happen. If this rampant art theft is allowed to continue, I believe it sets a very dangerous precedent, and makes the Internet a more hostile place for independent creators.
