As a screenwriter and author I am terrified at the dangers inherent in allowing AI generated works of &#39;art&#39; to be copyrighted. AI is programmed using human art, writing and art. Allowing studios and other companies to copyright AI produced materials will mean the end of human art, it will put the workers of an entire already low-paid industry out of work, by allowing companies to profit from AI and removing the need for humans. It will be a huge and fundamental loss for humanity and the future of art and the creative industries.
