Copywrite protections from AI is important. I believe if there is an original work that is being copied &amp; sold back as original work(s) undermines the creator&#39;s process while taking potential compensation from them. More so, I am concerned the AI that is publicly available is nothing in comparison to what AI can actually do at this point. I think what we have available was done purposely to ease us into what AI can achieve right now. Can AI be useful? Certainly but it can not overtake the human condition. If AI is allowed to the work(s) of humans then pay the humans full compensation of the plagiarized work(s). If AI is to do most of the work based on other(s) everyone who&#39;s work have been copied and used should get all of the compensation as AI isnt sentiant and does not need compensation for doing what is was designed to do by other humans. If the goal for AI is to take over most of the work(s) of humans then those who gain financially should pay those who have been replaced. Its only fair.
