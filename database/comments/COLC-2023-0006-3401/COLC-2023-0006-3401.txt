Using AI to steal the works of others discourages creators from creating and submitting their work -- be it art, writing, or music -- to the general public for consumption. It destroys the livelihood of creatives, those who are the bedrock of American culture but whose ability to create freely and without commodification is already extremely limited. If AI is allowed to continue to steal copyrighted work to turn out mediocre immitations, people will no longer want to become professional creatives. We will lose human inginuity and will be subjected to pale, derivative movies, books, art, and music just so that corporations don&#39;t have to pay real people. AI threatens American jobs, including in Hollywood, one of our most iconic industries. Please don&#39;t let AI continue to steal copyrighted material for any reason.
