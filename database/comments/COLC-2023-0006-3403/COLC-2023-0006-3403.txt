AI must not be trained on a human&rsquo;s writing or art without explicit written permission from the writing or art&rsquo;s human creator, and AI must not be permitted to create art or writing in situations where the art or writing is the primary commodity being sold and presented to an audience. I will not have AI stealing other people&rsquo;s writing to spit out television shows, novels, and art like we&rsquo;re mass-producing rubber bands while human artists starve. AI has many uses, but art should not be one of them, and it must be regulated strictly and heavily.
