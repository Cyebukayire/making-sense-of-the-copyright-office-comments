Evolutionary changes are a key determining factor in the growth of a biological entity. As such, human beings, though widely regarded in their own self view as the most evolved, have not yet had their evolutionary biology keep pace with technological advances. This can only create turmoil. AI is dangerous for a myriad of reasons, and helpful for a few. It should be used with caution and sparingly in areas where evolution and technology NEED to be more closely linked. For example, utilizing AI to test new ways to help stroke victims communicate with the world. This would be a closely monitored use of AI wherein a result is finite. To utilize AI in all settings, &quot;because we can&quot; and think that this will not destabilize an already fractured and uneven populace, is hubris of the highest order. The written works of a civilization should be from the mouths of the people who lived and worked the experience. Not a computer that is programmed by a few, with their own limited views usually skewing white and male, for the many.
