Given that the currently in-vogue forms of AI consist mainly of synthesizing human-generated content, typically taken either from the public domain or without the explicit permission of the authors of that content, I believe that the results of such a processes (derivative content) must also be considered part of the public domain. Different rules may apply for content which is derived from a known corpus with a coherent single copyright holder or group of copyright holders.<br/><br/>The algorithms used to generate such derivative content are of course copyrightable. In general, persons using AI tools to &quot;generate&quot; derivative content do not and cannot claim ownership of its results, though they may be able to copyright any documents they generate describing their use and patent any such methods of use.<br/><br/>There are open questions about the copyright for works produced by humans which incorporate AI-generated content. While difficult to measure, my feeling is that a &quot;whole work&quot; can be copyrighted even if it contains generated portions, while the generated portions themselves remain in the public domain if that was their source. While a rough rubric, the ability to re-generate specific sections of text, sound, images, etc. in nearly exact form may be sufficient to claim that those specific portions of a work may fall within the public domain. However, this creates challenges, as humans, too, synthesize information and fully human-generated works may contain portions which are effectively a part of the public domain. Nevertheless, copyright applies to works as a whole, and if whole works can be demonstrated to consist only of prior art, then their copyright should be void whether machine-generated or human-generated. In practice, all claims of invalid copyright are subject to examination and the processes already in place to address such claims may already be sufficient to invalidate false copyright claims resulting from the use of content generated from public information; in particular a demonstration of the ability to produce sufficiently similar content through publicly or commercially available tools. Such a policy also provides an incentive for authors to be cautious about protecting their copyrighted products from use in AI learning pools, since that use would effectively indicate that their work is in the public domain.<br/><br/>Companies which operate and sell AI products must become aware of and be held liable for any claims about the ownership of their training data and its results. A company which transitively applies a &quot;public domain&quot; rule to its products and which seeks out copyrighted content for its training has engaged in theft of copyright; and should be subject both to individual cases where such theft is discovered and to government action for the more general case and as a deterrent.<br/><br/>New rules may be necessary to clarify what information should be considered in the public domain, out those which are publicly accessible. Some tools (such as the Creative Commons standard use licenses) are available to assist data harvesters in confirming the status of their source data. Automated tools which harvest such data can be adjusted to confirm copyright status as part of the harvesting process. Attempts to seek authors&#39; opt-in for collective use in training data may also be automated. The present &quot;wild west&quot; approach to data gathering and use, particularly including through the usage of agreements regarding the sale of user content to partners which did not anticipate such use, requires amendment and may require special copyright rules until it has been addressed legislatively.<br/><br/>In short, it is not viable to allow works generated from copyrighted content without the original authors&#39; explicit consent to be copyrightable or have commercial value. AI tools must be adjusted to provide clarity on the copyright and consent status of their corpora and end products.
