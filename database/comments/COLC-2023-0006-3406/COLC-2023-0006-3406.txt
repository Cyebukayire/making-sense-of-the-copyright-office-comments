I believe that use of data to train AI should require permission from the legal owner of that data, and that AIs trained on data that the owners do not have permission to use, as well as any works created by such AI, should be regarded as infringing on the copyright and intellectual property of the original holders of that data. Ethical and legal use of artificial intelligence is predicated on the obtaining of consent for the data used to train them.
