AI generated content should not be copyrightable. You did nothing other than give a pre-existing framework other existing work to learn from, and then give it a prompt to generate from that. The entire process relies on using other works freebooted off the internet and even the program and training itself isn&#39;t your property. At every step of the way, there is something that the one generating the content does not own. Unless they are going to build the AI from the ground up and make ALL of the content that the AI learns from to generate content, that content cannot be copyright applicable. Also, AI is known for being stupid as hell and failing at answering basic questions accurately.
