I am wholly against the notion that AI can &ldquo;use&rdquo; voices and images of living people without the consent or permission.  AI that uses human likeness should be classified as a copy of all the humans sourced, for its creations. AI doesn&rsquo;t not actually create,  it sources. Therefore AI must be regulated and it&rsquo;s creators must be made to cite their sources.
