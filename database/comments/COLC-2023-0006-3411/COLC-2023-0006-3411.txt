I am an amateur author and volunteer for a website that hosts amateur fiction.  Our website was scraped as part of dataset training for large language models, without any compensation or permission.  Many of our authors were disturbed by this when it became known, as well as by people beginning to use those models to, for instance, generate endings for yet-unfinished serialized stories posted to this site.  Although these works are not written for pay, but for the love of writing, nevertheless these authors hold copyright over their works and deserve to be treated with all the respect and fairness that authors who write for pay deserve.  This type of scraping without permission will have a chilling effect on amateur fiction posted online, as people will restrict access, refuse to share their work publicly, or simply not write at all if this is the way their hard work is going to be treated.  Some of these authors are interested in going on to publish professionally in the future - if they are stymied at this early stage of their development, then they will be less likely to go on and pursue professional writing as a career, which will materially harm the future of the writing industry.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>
