AI-generated works such as writing or text may have the potential to act as great tools, but must not serve as replacement for the hard work of human writers and artists. AI is notoriously finicky, with programs such as Chat GPT being prone to misinformation and outright taking already previously copyrighted work and presenting it as an original answer without any form of citations. AI is not an intelligent or creative force: it can ONLY exist because of the hard work of humans being fed into its database, and it cannot work in isolation from humans. Because human input is vital to the process of AI generated work, AI generated works should not be allowed to copyright material unless they can prove without a doubt that the only resources from which an AI generated from is either original content, stock imagery, and/or collected with the artist&rsquo;s or writer&rsquo;s permission.
