Modern AI is in fact not at all artificial intelligence. There is nothing intelligent about it. All modern AI does is steal from others, then compile the data to regurgitate a horrific amalgamation of other people&rsquo;s hard work. AI has been used to steal from artists, authors, and make a mockery of people by allowing AI users to steal people&rsquo;s voices and faces to make them say things the person originally never would have. People are using AI to not only steal, but replace actual people in the work place as to not pay them. This is causing a lot of jobs to take a hit. AI, since it can never ever make something original and only ever steal to &ldquo;create&rdquo;, is nothing more than a Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster. There should be strict rules on AI, else people will never want to create ever again for fear their creations are stolen from them.
