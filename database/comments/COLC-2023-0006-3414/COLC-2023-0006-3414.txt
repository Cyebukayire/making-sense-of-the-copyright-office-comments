AI uses artists work, copyrighted or no, to create a facsimile amalgam of art, writing, or research. Using someone else&#39;s ideas and passing them off as your own was the reason copyright was instilled in the first place. You can&#39;t copyright AI art because the images it&#39;s trained off of do not belong to the prompter or developer.
