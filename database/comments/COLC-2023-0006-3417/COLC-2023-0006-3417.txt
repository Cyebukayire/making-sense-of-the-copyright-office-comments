I am an amateur writer on a fiction archive called Archive of Our Own, and i&rsquo;ve found my work &ldquo;scraped&rdquo; wholesale from other worked cleared created by AI. i Find this unconscionable, and as a creative person frustrating and upsetting. AI is not a real creative process and should not be treated as such. It steals from other people&rsquo;s hard work.
