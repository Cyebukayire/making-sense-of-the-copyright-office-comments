I work as a writer for a marketing agency, and I also write in my leisure time. I have considered myself a writer since I was in grade school. I sold my first short story when I was nineteen, and I published my first novel at twenty-nine. While I have yet to reach the upper echelon of fame as a writer like Stephen King or Danielle Steel, I still find that a goal I wish to reach. I feel that companies using the works of writers like myself - scraping blogs, site content, transformative works, and other sources - will undermine people like myself who wish to utilize our skills in the way we wish.<br/><br/>I support Artificial Intelligence in places where it can benefit mankind, such as improving our health and environment. I do not feel AI should be utilized to create art, written, visual, or audio, because these are gifts creative people bring to the world. A story, a poem, a song and even a film script is borne of human emotion and experience. AI possesses neither of these things. We can train AI to replicate a Stephen King novel, but it will always lack the spirit and heart King puts into his writing.<br/><br/>I ask Congress to consider the ramifications of allowing AI to infiltrate the arts. While enjoyed on a broad scale, the arts are deeply personal. To allow AI to copy styles of writers and actors, replicating likenesses on screen or generating words, removes the soul of the piece. At the end of the day, we are attracted to the stories and songs because their creators put their heart and soul into them.
