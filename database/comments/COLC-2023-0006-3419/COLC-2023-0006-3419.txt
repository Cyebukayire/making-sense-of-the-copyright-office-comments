AI is fundamentally an attempt to use technology to circumvent individual copyright restrictions. It attempts to abuse grey areas in fair use claims by taking publicly available information and repackaging it in black-box algorithms, the products of which are marketed and sold as whole cloth &#39;new&#39; creations. The reality is that if there were strong legal restrictions and enforcement on the data they harvested to create LLVMs they would effectively not have a product. The uncomfortable question at the heart of AI is &#39;who&#39;s data is this actually, and what are their rights?&#39; - and the answer is that the legal fees alone to determine the answer to that question would bankrupt any company involved.<br/>There are reasonable questions to ask about the nature of &#39;remixing&#39; data in this way vs humans doing it (which has been typically protected in the past, assuming they adhere to the licensing restrictions on the data they use - see Danger Mouse&#39;s Grey Album as an example of this). However, the rights of every artist and individual to the product of their labor should not be trampled upon simply because businessmen once again want to take advantage of lax regulation not keeping up with the pace of private industry advancement.<br/>AI companies will argue that these algorithms are generative and novel enough to warrant their products being deemed as transformative. That may be true, but it cannot be ignored that they created those products from training data they illegally and immorally sourced, and they should be at least compelled to make a full account of that data and how they have maintained compliance with the licensing restrictions on them.<br/><br/>The reality is they want to cut human beings out of every creative process imaginable, and they see the dollar signs in selling that to companies who are already scared of rising labor union membership.The copyright office has an opportunity here to put their finger on the scale of justice and demand that people are given ownership of their data in a way that will protect future generations from these corporate thieves.
