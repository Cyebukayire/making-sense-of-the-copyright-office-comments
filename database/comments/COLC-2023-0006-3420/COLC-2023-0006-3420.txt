Things made by AI should not be copyrightable, as current implementations of AI are just copying the work of others, including many that did not agree to their work being used in this way. This has been prominent enough that software is being created in an attempt to protect people&#39;s art from such use, such as Glaze made by a group from the University of Chicago. The creation of this software was met with AI supporters complaining about it ruining their data, which proves that they don&#39;t ask permission for the use of people&#39;s artwork before they feed it into their AI.  I&#39;ve attached a screenshot of one such twitter post.<br/><br/>This mass scraping of data off the internet is what&#39;s used to create any form of AI art, and the actual creations are akin to someone fine tuning a Google search until they find something they like, and then claiming they created it themselves.
