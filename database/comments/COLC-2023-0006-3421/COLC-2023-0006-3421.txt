AI tools, as they&rsquo;re presently constituted, are little more than blazingly efficient plagiarism  machines. They train themselves on the products of human labor &mdash; already an ethically and legally grey area &mdash; and present their &ldquo;product&rdquo; as if it&rsquo;s some wonder of computer engineering. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s merely a cleverly composed regurgitation and recombination of the human-labor-generated material on which it&rsquo;s been trained.<br/><br/>It should come as no surprise then that major corporations, which have already consolidated wealth by devaluing labor for decades and decades, are champing at the bit to gain unfettered access to use of their technology. For them, it&rsquo;s a golden opportunity to gain access to what they&rsquo;ve always wanted: free labor. This must not be allowed.<br/><br/>AI-generated works must not and should never be copyrightable, as they are always wholly or in part based-upon original, human-produced, and copyrightable works. It&rsquo;s really that simple.<br/><br/>If a student who never attended class, never did homework, nor even studied the subject of the class submitted a term paper written by combining words, phrases and sentences cribbed from 20 years of other students&rsquo; term papers &mdash; I ask: would you give that paper a passing grade or would you fail it for what it is &mdash; plagiarism? It&rsquo;s a rudimentary example, but it illustrates the point well. The purpose of the technology is not to generate something original with knowledge and mastery of craft behind it. The purpose of the technology is to create something that appears to have these things, but upon anything other than a surface examination does not.<br/><br/>I hope you wouldn&rsquo;t fall for a cheating student; I hope you won&rsquo;t fall for this.
