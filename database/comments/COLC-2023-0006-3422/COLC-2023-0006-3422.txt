AI&#39;s output should not be copyrightable. While machines can technically fabricate &#39;things&#39; that have received the copyright designation, the submission for approval is based on human-made designs. The output from AI itself is not human made. I might accept that an algorithm or code can have copyright, but not the things it produces. There are further ethical questions of consent when it comes to what the programs &#39;consume,&#39; which should also be taken into consideration.
