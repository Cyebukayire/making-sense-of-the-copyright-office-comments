Artificial Intelligence is a direct threat to creatives in every field. AI can only work using the human made work of others, often stolen or used without the original creator&rsquo;s knowledge or consent. Meaning that AI art users (both individual and corporate) can make works that steal profits from original creatives. This affects every creative field and industry from visual art, animation, special FX, movies, shows, books, comics, and music. Your favorite books, movies, and shows would not exist without human creation. Your children&rsquo;s favorite books, movies, and shows would not exist without human creation. Your friends and families favorite books, movies, and shows would not exist without human creation. If individuals and corporations (Disney, Sony, Adobe, and so many more) are allowed to use and implement AI into their products and productions you will never see anything new or interesting or truly creative again. Because AI can only work off of preexisting ideas, it can not create something out of nothing. And if corporations are allowed to use AI it will be a direct threat to the lively hoods of millions of hard-working Americans, dead and alive. If corporations are allowed to use AI they will use it to create works that mimic those who have past, it would be incredibly rude, disrespectful, and arguably inhumane. How messed up would it be to hear the voice of a dead voice actor in a new film? Or see the AI butchering of a dead actor on screen in a live-action show or movie? It would not be keeping their memory or legacy alive, it would be like puppeteering a corpse. It would be akin to grave robbery. <br/><br/>What we, human artists and creatives, need are strong laws and protections to keep our work, or livelihoods, safe from the greed of AI and its users.
