AI must be regulated. The internet is filled with the theft of intellectual property, but no robbery has been greater than by those who are running AI companies. Companies should not get to be the beneficiaries of money made on the backs of work they did not create. America has been behind on regulation in every sector, but the internet and technology most of all. With the internet almost entirely owned by a few conglomerates, it is impossible to opt-out of having your work stolen for use in AI. AI is a flawed technology that&mdash;despite its flaws&mdash;will ruin large sectors of the economy. We need to regulate it now. Like Napster before it, it seeks to destroy industries for the benefit of very few people who are already at the top.
