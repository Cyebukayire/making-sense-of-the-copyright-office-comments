Works produced by AI are not original works and should never be subject to copyright. They are created by feeding art and text through a software program and are rarely attributed to the original artist(s) or author(s). AI is only of interest to corporations and others acting in bad faith because it enables the misattribution, plagiarism and theft of original works including live and recorded performances that are not in the public domain.
