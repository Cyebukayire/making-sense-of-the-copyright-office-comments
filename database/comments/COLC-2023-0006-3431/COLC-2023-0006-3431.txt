These pattern-finding bots (known as &quot;AI&quot;) have been trained on stolen material, from art being sold in online shops to actors&#39; voices to medical photos and beyond. Whether or not the AI creation can be considered truly unique after putting bits and pieces together and copying generalized patterns, the fact that it is all currently based on stolen information is NOT okay and should not receive any kind of protection. (And, in fact, should be punished.)
