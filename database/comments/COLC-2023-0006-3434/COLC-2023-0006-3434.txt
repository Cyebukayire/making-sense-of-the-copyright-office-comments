AI essentially uses input information to spit out a generally similar product.  In this way, it needs to use human-made works in order to function at all.  In order to protect the rights of people - all people including artists, writers, and really anyone who has ever written anything - there has to be restrictions on what content AI can use to produce results.  There needs to be regulations which require consent from the people who produce the initial content prior to its use in AI.  Additionally, AI creations need to be clearly denoted as such, with additional disclosure of what precisely the AI was trained on and who contributed.  Any use of AI which involves nonconsenting creators&#39; work being used must be classified as an infringement of copyright and the person who Used/Created the AI penalized accordingly.
