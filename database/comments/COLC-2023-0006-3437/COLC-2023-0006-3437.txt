To Whom It May Concern,<br/>I fully agree with DC District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell in the recent ruling, where they said human beings are an &ldquo;essential part of a valid copyright claim.&rdquo; A.I. use with little to no assistance from humans should not be protected under copyright law. As a writer myself, and as someone who is fortunate enough to be involved with an artistic community, I know firsthand how hard creators work. To have their hard work be freely used without permission or fair compensation will only make those with A.I. connections richer, who would make profit for doing no work whatsoever. This is already the case regarding the Writers Guild strike, with entertainment companies that would rather have A.I. try to tell stories based on previously written material than to support living artists whose personal lived experiences and practices make them the writers they are today. I implore the U.S. Copyright Office to stick with its current viewpoint on A.I. use, and to protect true, living human creators&rsquo; work from being stolen and exploited. Thank you for your time.
