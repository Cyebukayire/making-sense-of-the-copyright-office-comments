I have a few major objections to extending Copyright to the output of &#39;AI&#39; Processes:<br/><br/>1) In all my research it has never been explained to me how a Large Language Model (LLM or &#39;Generative AI Process&#39;) is anything other than a mathematical process.  There is no claim of sentience behind the LLM, and in fact it is demonstrably not aware or able to understand context, which is why it just makes things up whenever the model indicates that there should be a &#39;thing&#39; there to cite, etc.  As such it is the output of a mathematical process and where the process may be protected, the output should never be protected.<br/><br/>2) As this is machine generated output, it seems absurd to protect it.  What would stop a company or companies from running the process millions of times 24/7 and flood the market with all the gibberish imaginable, seek Copyright for it, and thus block out most of the scope for human interaction by making ANY written communication an exercise in detecting what has and has not already been generated?  How can that process go on before there is effectively no scope for commercial writing by humans as we are crushed out by an avalanche of words spewed out by non-sentient &#39;writers&#39;?<br/><br/>3) What societal benefit is there for protecting works generated by a LLM?  The fundamental purpose for Copyright is to promote the creation of works by granting their creators a monopoly on their words for a set time.  This makes sense when the effort to create said words is limited by the effort required to create it.  How does granting additional rights beyond whatever commercial value the output of the LLM may already have when it was run benefit the society as a whole vs. what are the odds that this gets weaponized?<br/><br/>4) Who is supposed to get the copyright?  Typically the Author of a work gets the copyright as a reward for their labor?  They may then transfer that through a legal process.  As LLM&#39;s are not sentient, are not people, and thus do not have rights, and do not have the mental capacity to transfer their rights, what are we doing here?  How is assigning Copyright to the output of a LLM any different than assigning Copyright protection to the output of a Typewriter?  Hasn&#39;t this been settled as a matter of law?  I seem to recall that the maker of a typewriter, then word processors, and then online services have each successively claimed to own the copyright on every word outputted by them, and I believe that&#39;s never been successfully defended.  Logically, how is this different?  Is it merely because the quality out output is higher?<br/><br/>5) These models were all trained on language harvested off the internet, almost always without any attempt to get permission from the owners of their copyright by their creator.  How is it then fair, after a model has been trained to be able to write articles using my word choice, and cadences such that it can create a reasonable approximation of my output, is it not enough that it is choking out my ability to earn a living with the fruit of my mental labor?  What is to stop a company hostile to me from training a model on my work, then it&#39;s owners spitting out a million treatises on a potential topic that I may need to write about, then suing me for violating THEIR copyright when I go to write an article on it myself?  If you think this won&#39;t happen, think again, we&#39;ve seen bad actors do similar things before, and if the only requirement to copyright material is a few pennies to pay an algorithm to generate it, it WILL happen to any target even a trivial number of people dislike.<br/><br/>This is a PROFOUNDLY bad idea that can only benefit the few people who develop this technology with the resources to massively parallelize these algorithms.  It will give a HUGE first mover advantage to whomever can start choking out all the available space for possible combinations of words.  How long will it take for this technology to allow a tiny number of people to lock out society from creating ANYTHING for fear of using a portion of some material already under copyright, and thus being sued, before all public discourse and creativity is subsumed under the deluge of &#39;AI&#39; generated content, and copyright becomes a bludgeon to prevent the thing it was meant to promote?
