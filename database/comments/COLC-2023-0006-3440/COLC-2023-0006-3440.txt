AI programs are being used to copy artists&#39; talents, robbing them of their life&#39;s work, income, and intellectual property. AI programs emulate art for those who don&#39;t support the arts, don&#39;t care about the livelihoods of others, and those who want to subvert unions (i.e. Disney and other studios). AI work should not be copyrightable. AI work is randomly generated or is generated by stealing from others and should be considered copyright infringement. AI is more harmful than good; learning algorithms are often &quot;trained&quot; on public and private works, leading to infringement, debasement of ideas, and clear violations of privacy, trust, and artistry. AI programs and outputs (i.e. AI art or voice work) should never be copyrighted or have the ability to become copyrighted.
