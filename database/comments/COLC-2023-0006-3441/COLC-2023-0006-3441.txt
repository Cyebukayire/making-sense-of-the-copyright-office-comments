Hello,<br/><br/>Thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak out about our feelings regarding AI and more specifically in my stance, generative AI.  Generative AI needs to be held to high standards of copyright law.  In most cases in the early days of generative AI it was trained on artist&#39;s content without their consent.  These softwares would scrape google, twitter, deviantart, tumblr, etc... for anything it could and feed that into its training model.  On top of that, users engaging in &quot;creative&quot; prompts could grab images directly from the internet and use that as to guide the AI as well.  Turning away from visual art, we are now seeing situations of audio AI models being used to replicate celebrity voices, again, against their will.  Look into it beyond the surface level and you will see artists who have been hurt by these practices.  Be it content they don&#39;t or didn&#39;t approve of, or works based on their own which look nothing more than a copied-homework level replication.  And now, since these tools are becoming more and more popularized they are threatening industries by putting artists out of work for cheap AI results.  All in the name of saving a buck and maximizing profits.  That in itself will do great harm to the consumer level economy.  Because of course its great for the upper level, the corporations.   Do the right thing and put laws into place to stop this before it gets out of hand.  Keep AI in check and keep the real humans who are making real art first. <br/><br/>Outside of the art world, how long before it starts effecting other things?
