As an author and nonfiction writer, I am deeply concerned about unregulated AI. Beyond the concerns I have seeing friends lose work because an editor or employer hoped one employee with AI prompts could replace an entire team of people (and those concerns are severe), I worry about the state of creativity and copyright under AI. These machines are trained on writing done by real people, all of whose works are protected by copyright under law (frankly, the theft of others&#39; material to use and claim as something new would be illegal if done by a person). This technology has already been allowed to do significant damage, and copyright holders currently have no recourse to claim damages or even to protect their work from being used against their will to profit others. It is a threat to creativity; it is a threat to jobs; it is deeply in need of regulation to protect copyright holders and creative jobs. (New York)
