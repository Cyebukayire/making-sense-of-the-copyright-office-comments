I&#39;m a TV writer / producer who is incredibly concerned at the prospect of AI stealing my work and undermining my copyright. AI scrapes data from my and others&#39; works, and uses it to create derivative work without compensation or acknowledgment. We need to create clear guard rails on what AI is allowed to data mine, and how the monetization of that will work. If we do not, the very concept of copyright will be undermined, and the hard work of so many will be stolen. This is an existential crisis for the creative community.
