Content that is made using AI should not be protected by copyright, as it is not a unique product but actually an amalgamation of data/content that is farmed from other sources. AI created content that is used for profit and is found to have utilized/farmed copyrighted content should be liable for copyright infringement. AI generators do not exist in a vacuum, as they are programmed by humans and utilized by humans - so the humans who program and utilize that tool are just as subject to adhering to copyright law as a human using traditional art mediums to trace over multiple existing works to create a &lsquo;new&rsquo; piece that appears unique at first glance but is truly an amalgamation of other copyrighted works.
