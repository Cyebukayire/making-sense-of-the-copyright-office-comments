Artificial Intelligence, &quot;AI&quot;, should not receive copyright protections. It is detrimental to many individuals in art communities. So many people have had their art style stolen to train AI programs. There are cases in which an artist has died, but bad actors using AI programs to replicate, often poorly, the deceased artist&#39;s work to profit off of them. Big Hollywood studios have gone on record of saying they want to use AI to replace writers and actors, and want real people to go without proper compensation and become homeless. Do not let AI be covered by copyright. You will hurt real people by doing so.
