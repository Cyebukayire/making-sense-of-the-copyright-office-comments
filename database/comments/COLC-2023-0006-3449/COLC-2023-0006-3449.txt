Thank you for doing this. I believe it must be made clear in law, that training AI using human creations without the permission of the artists makes all AI generated work a form of theft, and excludes it from being copyrighted as a unique or individual work. AI assisted tools for a creative, trained on THEIR OWN WORK should be exempt only in so much as it is a tool for the creation of work which the artist has opted in on. Creatives already face a system that is slanted against them--there are very few creative jobs that supply health or retirement benefits. Allowing technology companies to steal our work without payment or permission will fully eradicate the entire field of creative occupation. Copyright laws MUST exist as a means of protecting individuals&#39; creation and their right to reproduce it for economic benefit, not the rights of machines to steal it.
