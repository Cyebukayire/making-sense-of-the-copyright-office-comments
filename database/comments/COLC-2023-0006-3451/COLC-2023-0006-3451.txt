I am a writer, animator and former musician. I have sold two television pilots to large television networks and had multiple recording deals with major labels. I am VERY strongly opposed to using AI in any creative capacity. It not only will rob creatives like me of work and a livelihood, but will horrifically dumb-down all forms of art just for the financial benefit of corporations.
