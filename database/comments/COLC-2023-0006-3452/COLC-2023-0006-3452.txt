As a student of Machine Learning and AI, I believe that the current trends and regulations I am seeing are not prepared for AI and how it functions. There are several issues that I would wish to see addressed.<br/><br/>1. AI artwork should not be protected with the same protections as traditional artwork, notably because they were not created by a human, and I believe that allowing copyrights on AI work will allow for commercial endeavors that are unhealthy for the economy and the culture, particularly in putting hardworking American Artists out of work.<br/><br/>2. I believe that there should be much stricter protections for artists to prevent their works from being used as reference for training AI programs. It is unfair that people&#39;s art are being essentially copied by these programs and then being used for the profits of the AI creator (or even a third party) without compensation to the artist. I believe that by default, it should be a copyright infringement to use art for AI training, and consent to use art for AI training should be far more informed, and never a default.<br/><br/>3. I believe that an person&#39;s (particular an actor&#39;s) likeness should always belong to themself, and cannot be sold while they are alive, to prevent unfair contracts extorted by large companies.
