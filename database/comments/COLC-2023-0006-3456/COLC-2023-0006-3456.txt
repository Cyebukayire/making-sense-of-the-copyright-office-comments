The purpose of art is to create human connection. AI-generated images and text destroy that human connection--instead of a daily life filled with chances to experience things made by other people (be they advertisements, product design, music on the radio, and so on), we will instead experience a very lonely life where the things we see on a daily basis weren&#39;t made by anyone and where actual human connection is rare and hard to find. For this reason, I urge you to ban copyrighting AI created content and the use of copyrighted content to train AI.
