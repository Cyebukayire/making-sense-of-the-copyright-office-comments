The rise of artificial intelligence has lead to the theft of actual people&#39;s intellectual property and work. Artificial Intelligence isn&#39;t super accurate, but it&#39;s still the term that most people understand. The problem with AI is that it gathers existing work and bashes it together to create what a person is looking for. This isn&#39;t good because it steals work away from real people, like making cover art for books, with the use of stolen work. It&#39;s all theft. There is also little to no attribution and consent. Many artists have found that their work has been stolen against their will and reused for something they had no idea about. Art theft is already rampant, and AI has only aggravated it to a higher degree where &quot;AI artists&quot; will claim that it&#39;s technically their work now because they wrote a sentence asking for what they want.
