AI generated works should not be eligible for copyright. The line to draw is that any AI generated content must be in addition to a work produced by a human being. For example, someone using Generative Fill AI in Photoshop to expand a photograph that they took would qualify for copyright protection as the AI portions of the image have simply built upon a human-produced image. But anything that is built upon a base work generated by AI should not qualify for copyright protection. The same would apply to writing, unless sufficiently integrated into a work as a piece of a larger whole (e.g. art that is a commentary on AI could contain some AI-produced elements, but it must substantially be created by a human).
