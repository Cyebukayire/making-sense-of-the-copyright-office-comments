Hello US Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am a computer worker with a BS in Information Systems and a part time writer. So called &quot;generative AI&quot; or &quot;large language models&quot; are not fundamentally different than other computer programs in any way. The reason they exist now is a combination of the end of Zero-Interest Rate Policy and the property in which computer time and cost has been decreasing. They do not deserve special consideration and generative AI works do not deserve copyright protection.<br/><br/>Very simply, imagine a very large Excel spreadsheet, multidimensional for each &quot;token&quot; not a word, the program doesn&#39;t know what language is, consisting of the statistical likelihood they&#39;re followed by another &quot;token&quot;, most often a word. These spreadsheets are harvested from copyrighted work usually without the author&#39;s knowledge and the program can only generate from this spreadsheet based on statistical likelihood. The so-called &quot;training&quot; is often done by low-wage workers in places like Kenya and the Philippines where human workers fill out this spreadsheet and remove spurious and unpleasant associations like racist stereotypes.<br/><br/>If you had a &quot;generative AI&quot; trained on English, and the same program as a series of instructions, lets say an isolated Islander who speaks no English, could run the same program with a piece of paper, dice, and said spreadsheet of tokens and infinite time, they would get the same results. It is clear neither the Islander nor the program &quot;understands&quot; English, they are simply executing an algorithm. And by scrambling this spreadsheet around, they have not truly generated new content but taken a slice of this spreadsheet with some randomness for which ultimate token to choose.<br/><br/>You may recognize this as the Chinese Room Thought Experiment, and we have finally reached a point wherein an algorithm can generate what seems like coherent language to us but it is ultimately harvested from copyrighted work. Image based systems work like this as well, with buzzwords like &quot;stable diffusion&quot; being when the model is trained by blurring the original copyrighted art work and then forcing it to produce only results that at least resemble the blurred image. <br/><br/>Please do not fall for buzzwords, much like a monkey snapping a photo of itself, the existence of non-human generated content is not transformative or creative, especially the so-called &quot;generative AI&quot; techniques that rely on mass harvesting of copyrighted works. If you do, you will do tremendous damage to one of this country&#39;s great strengths, our freedom to express and reward expression has made the US the dominant cultural exporter in the world. Thank you for considering my comment which is most assuredly written by hand and I hope you make the correct choice to reject generative AI as worth of copyright protection.
