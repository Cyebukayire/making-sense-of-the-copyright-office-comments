AI generated content is not copyrightable; it is in fact an act of copyright infringement in of itself. Nearly all large scale AI models are trained off of copyrighted content that was created by humans, essentially making any product of said models inherently infringing. No AI generated art, writing, or other forms of content generated by AI should be even considered for copyright protection.
