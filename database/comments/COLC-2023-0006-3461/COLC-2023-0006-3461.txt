I am a professional writer. It has been my only income for over ten years, and this income depends on the people who know my work coming to me for the specific point of view and style that I bring. So-called &quot;AI&quot; functions by scanning work like mine, and then spitting out a compressed or slightly reconfigured copy. This is both directly stealing my work and also diluting its income generating ability by flooding the niche market I serve with generated plagiarism. I urge the copyright office to a) prevent the use of copyrighted material in &quot;AI&quot; training without the consent of the copyright holder and b) treat &quot;AI&quot; generated material as non-copyrightable, since it is the equivalent of me trying to claim a photographic reproduction of another artist&#39;s painting as my own original work.
