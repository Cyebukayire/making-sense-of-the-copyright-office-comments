Please do not allow copyright on AI produced content. Because that&#39;s what it is - content. It has no inherit value, as it was created based on stolen works without permission from the original creators. It is theft and, for lack of a better word, money laundering. It steals from the creators, taking their hard earned work through skill, merit, and time, and reduces it down to a simple plug and play program to make money. And make no mistake - the companies and individuals who make this program make a LOT of money. And the artists they steal from never see a cent of it. Do not allow this gross misconduct, theft, and blatant disregard for artists to be protected by law. You wouldn&#39;t shield a bank robber and let them keep their stolen funds - don&#39;t let AI generated content do the same.
