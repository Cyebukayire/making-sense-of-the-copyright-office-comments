AI Art steals directly from people who have spent years working on their skills and creating artwork, by using this artwork to feed the Ais without permission. I don&rsquo;t understand how you can grant someone copyright protection when they&rsquo;re stealing other people&rsquo;s intellectual property, and using that to steal people&rsquo;s jobs and replicate their work without even an ounce of understanding of art as a medium, time spent gaining skills, or care. It&rsquo;s just another way to understaff and underpay for people&rsquo;s talents. By giving AI art copyright protection, you&rsquo;d be encouraging people to continue these horrible practices. Also AI shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed protection because no human input actually goes into the production of these images, therefore it&rsquo;s not an intellectual property.
