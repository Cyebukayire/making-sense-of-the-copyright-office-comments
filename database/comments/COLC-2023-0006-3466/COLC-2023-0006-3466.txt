I&#39;ve been posting my art and writing online since I was ten years old. I love the community I&#39;m a part of and my ability to share my work with a large group. But in the last year I&#39;ve taken nearly all my work down because I don&#39;t want it scraped and used in AI training. I don&#39;t make any money off my writing or art, and I&#39;m still furious at the idea of artificial intelligence using my work. For authors and artists that depend on the internet for their livelihoods they are faced with an impossible decision to stop their creative works or else succumb to the oncoming machine. Particularly for creators that have copyright on their works I believe it breaks the spirit of the law when it comes to respecting copyright. I&#39;m a big fan of transformative work laws, but I don&#39;t believe artificial intelligence is transformative. Thank you for your time and consideration when it comes to this debate.
