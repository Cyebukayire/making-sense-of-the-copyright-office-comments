I think, for the better of the creatives, on the matter of using AI that it should be done in an certain manner.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Particularly, using AI for art.  Unjustified if its done in the matter of only using it without having put any human effort to it and making a profit on it.  <br/>AI ART if its trained through the use of other artist&#39;s work and crafted something using their work and then claimed as original piece, should the piece be considered theft.  <br/><br/>A good means to using AI for art, is to use it as a base, an idea and draw from it.  Improve it.  Make YOUR own with the HELP of AI!<br/><br/>This can also apply to all other forms of media.   AI should not be purely used to do everything, but instead to help set the foundation of one&#39;s craft.
