As a screenwriter, the copyright violations inherent in AI are obvious and egregious. If I write a script and am the copyright holder of that script, it&rsquo;s a violation of my rights for that script to be used to train an AI database. And since this has been already happening for a while, these AI systems that use copyrighted material without consent from the materials&rsquo; writers for training must be shut down and in the future, writers and creators must have the *option* to let their work be used to train AI or not, and if it is used, they must be compensated for that use and for future profits of projects made using the AI system, since it is inherently using those copyrighted materials
