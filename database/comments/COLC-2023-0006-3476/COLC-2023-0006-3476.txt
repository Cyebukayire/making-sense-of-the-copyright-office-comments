Thanks for hearing us over this issue.  I support content creators, and the way AIs function violates authors&#39; and artists&#39; rights to control their work while under copyright when used to train without the creator&#39;s consent.  When an AI takes a portion of a content creators&#39; work to &#39;train,&#39; it is theft.  It&#39;s like saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to buy a car, so I will take wheels from this person, an engine from this person,&quot; etc. until enough parts have been &quot;acquired&quot; to build a car.  No part of that car belongs to the person that built it, I&#39;m sure we would all agree.  But because the property in question now is on a digital format, being taken digitially, some don&#39;t consider it stealing.  It is.  Businesses should not be able to steal a content creator&#39;s work simply because they don&#39;t wish to pay for it or cannot afford it.  That has never been an excuse, and should not be now.  When you copy work from an artist, whether it is the entire pice, a portion, or even just the style, you are taking from their livlihood.  The bits and pieces used to &quot;train&quot; AIs is still theft, and takes business from all the creators that AI has stolen from.  I do not support the use of AI without a content creator&#39;s explicit consent, whether to &quot;create&quot; or to &quot;train.&quot;  No one should.<br/>Thank you.
