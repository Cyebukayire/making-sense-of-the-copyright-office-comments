The use of AI generated images based on machine trained on artists work without their consent, or the companies who hired them for their art, create a huge market problem as it oversaturated the space and create stress on the livelihood of the artists the machine feeds on, independent of the country of origin. It creates a problem with the fair use part of the &quot;Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work&quot;. Model trainers allege fair use of scrapped images as long as the result is reassembled on the generative result, transferring any copyright misuse to the user, with total disregard of how the model was trained, which really does have a hand on results. Lora Models based on stable diffusion present an extra problem as it can devalue the work of a specific artist and dilute their presence on the market, creating an impact, which i would argue goes against fair use of the artist material to train any model, specially without a method of compensation. <br/>No proprietary model can work without the need of huge amount of image data, specially for production of modern looking images. If a model would be traines on just common domain images it wouldn&#39;t be as requested due to the generative results not being accurate (example: If a model would be trained on Degas paintings, Degas doesn&#39;t have paintings of modern cars, the resulting generative image would not know what to produce if asked for one). That only leaves the companies behind generative images to use the material of our artists without consent, creating a landslide of images that oversaturates the markets (Etsy and Amazon for example are now full to the brim with cheaply made products that obscure finding the real thing). <br/>Despite the push of AI users to consider the AI generated images copyrightable, despite intervention and collaging after generation, or &quot;training them on their own art&quot; using Lora models, I would argue that no generation can be made without the base model that uses huge amounts of artworks non licensed, and create a market dent, devaluation of the work of all artists, a strain on the economy of many, and possibly litigious problems down the road for artists that can&#39;t afford to enter a legal battle with an AI grifting off of an artist work using a Lora model.  <br/>Only the implementation of either:<br/>- Opt in, not opt out of models for training<br/>- AI metadata tagging<br/>- Residual compensation for artists who have opted in said models
