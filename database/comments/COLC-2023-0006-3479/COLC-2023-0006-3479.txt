Artificial Intelligence is, and should be considered, a blatant breach of copyright laws. AI by nature cannot create. It learns by being fed with art, text and media. Anything &ldquo;created&rdquo; by AI has root in someone other&rsquo;s work. AI simply regurgitates what someone else has put time and effort into and passes it off as its own. AI scrapes data, finds patterns, saves its findings, and just as it is coded to, formulates responses to an input based on what it has seen. <br/>Authors, animators, illustrators, writers: artists. Artists are threatened by AI. In  recognising patterns in the data set it is given, AI simply repeats what it has been taught: and what it has been taught belongs unarguably to whomever created its original source. AI undeniably steals the work of others. Every single thing generated by an AI is an iteration of something built by someone else. AI cannot create. This is a fact. AI cannot create. Therefore, anything and everything it gives us must come from somewhere else, someone else - anything and everything it gives us must be stolen.
