Hi there, <br/><br/>I&#39;m commenting here today as an artist &amp; creator. Since the use of AI I have watched my work along with others peers, artists, and creators have their work uploaded without consent to AI databases. <br/><br/>The problem with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and other AI programs like this is that the data sets containing all of those images are based off of hundred &amp; thousands of others work. Real human artists work who were not approached, not asked, and in some cases people have built AI&#39;s specifically to replicate another artists work. <br/><br/>Which you can imagine can be harmful to that artists career and livelihood. I&#39;ve attached an example here that is a screenshot directly off the StableDiffusion reddit page. This bot is directly being fed hundreds of images from a specific artist to replicate their body of work. <br/><br/>In it&#39;s current status the use of AI in a creative space is theft. All of the datasets that have been gathered and created off the work of other artists. Whether this is drawing, painting, photography, music, really any creative medium. <br/><br/>There needs to be boundaries and regulations in place for this to protect people and creatives. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and I hope you&#39;re able to see the damages and repercussions this will cause if not addressed.
