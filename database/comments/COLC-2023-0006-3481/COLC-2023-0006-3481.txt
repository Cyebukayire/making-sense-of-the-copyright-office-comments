Artificial Intelligence should not be permitted to train off of any set of data (whether visual or auditory) without the explicit consent of the persons or group providing the data. This means that anyone attempting to create media using AI must contact and request permission from any artist, actor or other-wise to confirm that they would allow their work to be used as a basis for an algorithm to generate new media. The group or persons that are offering their data willing should always be credited when determining ownership of any AI-generated content (Ex. &quot;This image was created using an AI trained off the data set provided by ___________.&quot;) It should also be required for anyone signing a contract with a group to make known the fact that certain things they may create will be used as a training set for AI. Those who do not properly contact any person or group about this generation of media should be subject to potential copyright infringement or plagairism to the original work. <br/><br/>As a tangent, unrestrained AI generation would be a death knell for almost all creative endeavors, as well as a immensely dangerous tool for misinformation. On tr he creative side, if AI does not soon receive regulation, corporations could train data sets off of any random artist they find online, then create an image that&#39;s about 90% close to it and then make a profit off of the generated content with their only cost being the electricity that the computer uses to render said image, while the artist used as a data set would receive no compensation whatsoever and have their work plagiarized with course of action to challenge said generation because &quot;A machine made it, not you.&quot; Per the second point, AI is growing at such a rate that people have begun replicating peoples&#39; voices and making said voices say things that the owner of the voice may not agree with or condone (The fact we have to derermine who owns a voice is scary.) This means that if someone trained an AI off of YOU, THE PERSON READING THIS, THEY COULD MAKE AN AI REPLICA OF YOUR VOICE SAYING STATEMENTD THAT ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE OR EVEN CRIMINAL. Someone could then post this audio on the internet saying, &quot;(your name) confession to (insert crime)&quot; and you would have to prove that you did not say those things. Not only that, but the person that generated the content would have full control over what this AI says and could even sell your voice and make money off of whatever content it generates.<br/><br/>Additionaly, AI isn&#39;t even an &quot;intelligence,&quot; it&#39;s just a prediction engine that generates content based on previous information and simply places one word after the other (or pixel after pixel of an image) and is not &quot;aware&quot; of any context of how those words actually fit toegther as a whole work, whether written or otherwise. It doesn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; why it generates content or has an intent to place words in a certain order.<br/>
