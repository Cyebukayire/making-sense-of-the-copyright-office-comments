My work as a writer and artist is intellectual property, and AI and any persons, companies, or software using AI in any regard has no right to use my Intellectual Property now or at any time, whether I am alive or dead (this is in my will as well). Furthermore, any AI software that has used anyone&rsquo;s Intellectual Property without their consent needs to be deleted immediately, because the AI software has benefitted from materials it had no right to use and has irrevocably benefited as a result. There are many such AI software programs that have already illegally utilized the IP of numerous writers and artists&rsquo; works and/or their likeness, and that AI software must therefore be deleted in its entirety and be rebuilt to train and benefit from legal sources of works of art and writing. Anything less than this is unacceptable and this goes for any and every country.
