As both an artist and writer the concept of AI works being copyrightable is completely absurd to me. Especially so when most databases AIs pull from are made up of millions of copyrighted works that have been taken without permission and there&#39;s almost no way to get it out of these datasets reliably. As such the concept of being able to copyright something that is already dubiously legal and not even fully original feels like a complete slap in the face to actual copyright law.
