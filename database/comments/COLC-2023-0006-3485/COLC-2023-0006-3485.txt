Ai shouldn&#39;t be called art as it isn&#39;t made by the human hand, it&#39;s made using stolen images and sometimes just theft to make an image. Also the writing is just as bad as it takes other peoples writing to make something. Just ai is a machine and shouldn&#39;t be given the same protections as people for it is basically theft of work. So story short, No, ai isn&#39;t real so it shouldn&#39;t be copyrighted using stolen work
