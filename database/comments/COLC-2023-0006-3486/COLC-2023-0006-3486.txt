If AI is not wisely and strictly regulated, even the person reading this won&rsquo;t have a job in short order. The purveyors of AI mean to use it to replace human work and creation, and yours is the battlefield where people have a chance to win and set the rules. There is a difference between using a tool like a computer to help creation, and stepping aside to let that tool become a false owner or dominant contributor. It is not right to order a pizza at a restaurant and then claim you invented the pizza. That would change the foundational meaning of credits and rights, and what creativity is. We cannot let the few controllers of this new technology steal from the many and regurgitate existing works, and to rob the future of its own ability to create. Since the dawn of machines, writers have warned about machines thinking and dreaming for us, they have warned of this very day. Will you listen to them before it&rsquo;s too late? One hundred years from now, will anyone still know what a book is? That is up to you. Ban AI in whatever ways you can. Stop the cheaters from using it like athletes with steroids. Issue punishments for breaking your rules. Copyright says it right there&mdash;it is a right to copy. Do not grant this right to copy to a mechanical thing that cannot appreciate it or earn it. Protect this right that you grant and save it for people alone. The alternative is only darkness, truly. At that point, you might as well just burn the libraries. Instead, please fight this fight. And please win!
