Good morning reader, I hope you are well. As an artist, I believe &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is no more than the latest corporate grift to remove the soul from our media and replace it with a menagerie of stolen work in exchange for quick profit. Its technology is not true Artificial Intelligence, it is blatant theft from real, human artists who&#39;ve dedicated their life to their craft. To continue to allow this sham is to side with greed over the incalculable worth of human love and experience in art. I hope you understand what is at risk should we allow this to continue unregulated. Thank you for your time.
