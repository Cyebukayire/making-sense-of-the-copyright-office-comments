I strongly believe that artificial intelligence programmers should get permission for the use of every piece of text or art they train their AI on. If an item was made for public consumption and is in the public domain, that is acceptable. If the item is something that people made NOT for public consumption--personal letters, texts, emails, and I would argue also microblog sites like Twitter/X, Tumblr, and so on--or is not in the public domain, it is not acceptable for anyone to just take it and use it as fodder for their AI. I also strongly urge regulation around the use of AI to duplicate the writing or artistic style of an actual human being, ESPECIALLY those still alive. And I would say that AI should never be used to create &quot;digital doubles&quot; of actors in any context without their express and informed permission. Thank you.
