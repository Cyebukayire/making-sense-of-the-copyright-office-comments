1.Generative AI art creation tools unlock the ability for people not skilled in art to leverage technology to bring their creative vision to life. This allows those without the means to hire artist or spend years of their life training to share their ideas with the world in new ways. As the technology is further refined and AI art becomes less identifiable and gets past the uncanny valley it currently suffers from in many cases, this will unlock new options for the common person to endeavor in. Human artists will still have a place in creating innovative styles and characters, exploring new types of art and being the real creative engine in society. AI tools will simply occupy the space of repetition, merging and combining existing arts and styles, and making that ability accessible to the average person. <br/><br/>2.I personally work in the industrial automation technology sector so nothing comes to mind for me at the moment. We are exploring ways that AI could be leveraged in technological designs and programming but so far the technology is too far in it&#39;s infancy to be reliable for outputs that must be fool-proof. <br/><br/>3.No comment<br/><br/>4.No comment<br/><br/>5.I have no specific legislative ideas in mind but I would say from a layman&#39;s perspective, I have a very hard time distinguishing the difference between a set of humans eyes looking over thousands of pieces of art and creating something new that merges together ideas and styles from everything previously seen VS an AI model doing the same. If the output of the model is unique enough to not be a piece of infringing art on it&#39;s own, why does it matter what the input was? And if the input matters, why does a human mind with it&#39;s neurons doing the calculations vs circuits on a chip fall into a different category? I know that oversimplifies the question but I think that to oppose that basic question is to oppose the direction this entire conversation around AI is ultimately headed. <br/><br/>6.No comment<br/><br/>7.No comment<br/><br/>8.No comment<br/><br/>9.Once an item have been released for public consumption, there should be no assumption the copyright owner will have any control over who or what sees what has been publicly released.<br/><br/>10.No comment<br/><br/>11.No comment<br/><br/>12.No comment<br/><br/>13.Hindering the advancement of this technology by creating a copyright quagmire will only serve to hold back the development of the technology within America. Others will move ahead full steam with the same publicly available information our companies are currently leveraging, only they will have no concern over any legislation we impose upon ourselves and their toolsets will quickly surpass our own. The genie is out of the bottle in how to make this technology so to kneecap ourselves in making the technology better to protect the &#39;starving artist&#39; sector seems short sighted. New people will find ways to leverage this technology to create new art. AI will become the paintbrush or typewriter of tomorrow, unlocking the ability of more people to contribute to the fabric of our culture without the need for fine motor control skill in their wrists or the months or years of time to spend manicuring the perfect script. <br/><br/>14.No comment<br/><br/>15.Since the internet at large is heavily used in training data for many types of models, a requirement like this would either be rubber stamped/superficially addressed or a severe hindrance to the size of datasets used. <br/><br/>16.No comment<br/><br/>17.No comment<br/><br/>18.No, I believe that should be the tradeoff in utilizing this technology and the key to keeping a space in our society for true artist exist in. If someone manually creates a piece of unique art on their own, they get to copyright it and commercially benefit from it. If AI is used to create the art, it is not copyrightable but it allowed that person to bring something to life they otherwise would not have had the skill to do on their own, possibly to incorporate into a bigger project they are undertaking that IS copyrightable (think video game utilizing AI art assets or writing). If we allow people who leverage AI to copyright the outputs, that does not leave room for trained artist to still exist. <br/><br/>19.No comment<br/><br/>20.No comment<br/><br/>21.No comment<br/><br/>22.No comment<br/><br/>23.No comment<br/><br/>24.No comment<br/><br/>25.No comment<br/><br/>25.No comment<br/><br/>26.No comment<br/><br/>27.No comment<br/><br/>28.No comment<br/><br/>29.No comment<br/><br/>30.No comment<br/><br/>31.No comment<br/><br/>32.No comment<br/><br/>33.No comment<br/><br/>34.No comment
