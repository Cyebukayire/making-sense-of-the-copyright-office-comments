I am a writer currently on strike with the Writers Guild of America. I am strongly and passionately against any material generated by AI being protected by copyright. AI endangers the livelihoods of working artists, and it threatens the future of artistic expression and innovation. I am also against it as a consumer because I am not interested in paying for any kind of art generated by AI, nor do I want to support any company that claims to create art or entertainment while using AI to eliminate costs (because that is the only reason media corporations use AI). I am glad that the US government is looking into this, and it is my sincere hope that they protect creative workers and not technology built on plagiarism.
