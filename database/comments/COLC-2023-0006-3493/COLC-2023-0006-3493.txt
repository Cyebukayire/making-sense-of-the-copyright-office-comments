As a student in the professional and technical writing field and a hobbyist creative writer, I write to you today with deep concern over unregulated artificial intelligence programs. Used responsibly, AI programs can be a fantastic tool--they are, however, a poor replacement for a human professional. Currently, these programs are scraping the internet for original content, then creating derivative works based on said content. These works are then sold for profit by anyone from an individual &quot;AI artist&quot; on the internet, to a large corporation like Disney. When corporations and individuals utilize AI in the creation of for-profit content, they are profiting from stolen work. If an individual person faces legal repercussions for profiting from another&#39;s work, then so should corporations and individuals who utilize artificial intelligence technology in their content creation. Because AI can only produce derivative, un-original content, purely AI-made content should not be permitted to either hold copyright or be sold for profit. <br/><br/>Unregulated artificial intelligence hurts creators&#39; livelihood. Again, as a writer myself, I do not want my career to be over before it even starts due to the rampant use of unregulated AI in many industries. Furthermore, creators have little to no recourse for monetary damages done by AI due to poor copyright regulations. Imposing stricter copyright laws upon AI-created work will not only ensure that AI technology is used in the most responsible way possible, but also allow creators across a broad scope of industry to continue thriving.
