I am a writer and author. My entire livelihood comes from my writing, and the ability to sell various rights protected by copyright. I am not against AI, but it should not be allowed to ignore or change copyright law to diminish my own rights in any way. Human copyright must be respected, offered meaningful remuneration if used for training AI, and credited and remunerated if used in AI outputs. To allow tech companies to diminish copyright rights in any way goes against the entire purpose of a copyright in the first place. Please don&#39;t diminish my rights and my ability to make a living.
