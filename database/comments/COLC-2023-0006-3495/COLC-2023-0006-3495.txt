As a working artist, whose art would be targeted by the programs that train these AI machines, any work generated by AI that would source working artists should not be protected under copyright.<br/><br/>AI should source their references from public domain works, not works under already existing copyright by companies, working artists, and other creators.<br/><br/>Any and all AI-generated art that would use already-copyrighted material as its source should not, itself, be copyrighted.<br/><br/>I am of the opinion that AI-generated art should be labeled as public domain.
