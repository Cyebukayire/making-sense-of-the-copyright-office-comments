Hello. I do not feel that ai should be allowed to be trained on copyrighted works. If artists and authors are paid to create works to train the ai I still do not believe that the generated works should be copyrightable unless they are further manipulated to a good extent by a human. In my opinion training ai on works without express written permission violates the intellectual property of the creator. I do not write well necessarily or even works that I am looking to publish but if for some reason my stories were used to train ai I would feel deeply violated. I also feel that ai works could be used in negative ways especially if they are solely trained on one specific person. Thank you.
