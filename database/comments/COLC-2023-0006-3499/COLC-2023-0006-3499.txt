Anything produced by AI should not be able to be copy-written, the point of copyright is to protect the creator, but if something is made by a machine and not a human it did not come from an actual creator&#39;s mind. AI generally gathers information from a pool of creators by scraping data, often scraping from copyrighted works in the process, which as far as I am concerned should be under the same classification as a copyright violation; given it is creating something from a copyrighted piece without permission or contract from the copyright owner.<br/><br/>Unless every single piece of data used by AI to create something can be tracked, and appropriate permissions and contract granted, it should be handled as copyright violation. This is not like an artist referencing another or using them as an inspiration, this is a machine more or less directly copying another artist&#39;s work. <br/><br/>AI generated works should never, under any circumstances, be able to be copy-written on the grounds of ethics; given it would put many artists and creators directly out of their livelihood. Art is our culture, if art is made by a machine with no soul, there is no culture; just a soulless creation made for cheap. And, it should never be allowed on the grounds of legality due to a general inability to credit or pay any creator it derives works from.
