I am AGAINST A.I receiving copyright for 3 reasons:<br/><br/>1.) The technology is volatile and easy to abuse: <br/><br/>While the process of creating generative A.I works, does generate from pure noise (meaning it is not in the generation process using copyrighted works), it&#39;s not as straightforward to determine because of that the A.I works aren&#39;t stealing from peoples intellectual property. The technology that is being used is what&#39;s known as a black box in the tech world, which means it works, but the people who run these programs do not have the understanding as to how they work. Furthermore, the generative A.I had to learn how to generate from pure noise. This process means for millions of iterations, these algorithms weren&#39;t generating under pure noise. They used copyrighted materials to train an algorithm to no longer need them (in public demos, and servers). <br/><br/>2.) It&#39;s not innovation, it&#39;s their intent:<br/><br/>Copyright is used to protect a creator of their intellectual I.P. It&#39;s used to prevent abuse, and allow the creator freedom in ownership of their idea. This technology is mainly being used as a replacement for the creative industry. The SAG AFTRA strike for instance, had many CEO&#39;s looking into hiring A.I computer scientists with high figures, to effectively innovate out the input creatives have, as well as their livelyhood. And while you will experience this type of industry shakeup with any new technology, their intent is more so to circumvent copyright, then to create genuine works worthy of copyright protection. If you can scab the entire archives of the internet of all it&#39;s Star Wars like content, and create a new I.P using generated artworks that are very similar to Star Wars, but distinctly different enough to avoid a lawsuit from Disney, then are you really creating a new piece of work, or more-so generating an algorithm that abuses fair-use and copy right law?<br/><br/>Furthermore if you decide this new I.P can be copyrighted itself, then what does it mean for whole new companies to exist, by creating the low hanging fruit and interesting ideas, copy-righting them, and then preventing others from using their intellectual property without paying a fee? What would this say for the regular artist who does not have the funds like these mega corporations or data miners, with their massive server rooms that could easily create entire businesses replacing well known artists and their styles, at the click of a button, and also claim ownership of the work they generate?<br/><br/>3.) Who&#39;s asking for it to be under Copyright Protection?<br/><br/>Artists, writers, musicians, animators, aren&#39;t the ones that are asking in big numbers to protect their A.I works. The individual, isn&#39;t really asking for them to be protected either. There are always outliers, but for the majority, creatives want to create, and they want to be protected. It&#39;s major studios and/or grifters who are the most vocal minority in favor of being protected by Copyright. And that&#39;s dangerous, because if you give into their demands, then the whole backbone of the copyright system which was to protect human creation and ingenuity is over. <br/><br/>I can see a future where A.I assistance is granted to works, and allowed for copyright. Such as if a studio used generative algorithms on it&#39;s own dataset that it created with their own works. Or maybe an animator used an Generative A.I to help assist in creating in-between frames. Maybe for a musician who releases an EP but it was mastered or mixed by A.I. <br/><br/>But as it stands we aren&#39;t even close to being there yet. As of right now the copyright system is the last resort in preventing the volatile A.I algorithms from automating away creators rights, and livelihoods.<br/><br/>I do not support A.I receiving copyright.<br/><br/>thank you for your time.<br/><br/>
