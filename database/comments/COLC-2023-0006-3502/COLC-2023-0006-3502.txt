I am very concerned about the growing corporate use of generative AI.<br/><br/>It is extremely unethical to train AI on copyrighted works. In addition, AI generated works have already been used to spread deadly misinformation and therefore to harm the public. AI cannot truly &quot;learn,&quot; only regurgitate stolen information, and an AI does not have to factor in the legal consequences of infringement and spreading misinformation the way a human would. Since it cannot be held accountable for the harm it causes, it should not receive the same rights and protection as human authors.<br/><br/>It is bad enough that corporations are using AI to eliminate jobs and destroy the livelihoods of creatives, but there is also the environmental factor to consider, as AI sucks up exorbitant quantities of natural resources.
