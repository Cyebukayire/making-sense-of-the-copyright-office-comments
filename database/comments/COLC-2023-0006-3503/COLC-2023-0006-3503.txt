Artificial Intelligence has become a massive issue for artist, musicians, writers, actors, voice actors and many other creators. The software almost exclusively illegally takes a person&#39;s creation be it art, music or even their own voice and likeness and makes a cheap recreation for people to exploit. Why pay a voice actor when you can use this program that takes their voice in other media, that they have no legal right to use, and put it into a software that let&#39;s you create anything with that voice. It&#39;s a way for companies to steal from creators just so they can save a bit of money. Artists have been very out spoken about how often their works are taken without permission or credit and used to feed these softwares. Pieces of Art are stolen and retreated, then sold with no regard to the original artist. The developers of these Ai softwares currently face zero legal repercussions for stealing and making profits off of other people&#39;s works. <br/>I understand that this isn&#39;t an easy issue to tackle and perhaps a start would ideally be to not have developers steal in the first place. If they can prove every image that was used to feed the algorithm was sourced legally with receipts from the artist for each image. If that was required then almost every ai program on the market would no longer be viable.
