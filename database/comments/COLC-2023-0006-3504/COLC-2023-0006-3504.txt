As a citizen of the United States I believe the flagrant use of AI to be a clear violation of the rights of myself and others to freely express ourselves online in unique and creative ways without fear of having your work stripped away without consent for a profit. The current lack of regulations around AI have caused many creative works to be blatantly stolen without care for the original creators. The use of AI by large corporations allows them to avoid fairly compensating creators since they can instead pay a cheaper price to use technology unwillingly built off the backs of those very same creators.
