The enron emails that was cleaned and edited is an example of training set data used by plenty of chat bots. This data was made public before the law had evolved. However this training set is copyrighted because it has been made clean of personally identifiable information, etc.  <br/><br/>This thinking is very similar to established law concerning the yellow pages. The textual information itself isn&#39;t copyrightable but the layout, graphics inside and organization of such material was a copyright. One could imply that such actions required human involvement and creativity. Just as artwork is a human involved process. This comparison could also be made with encyclopedias. They are full of knowledge, if one sampled the public enough, with with enough sampling specilization may not be required and could be described as common knowledge. However when taken aggregated by multiple people and creatively manipulated to something understandable by all, this is creativity.  <br/><br/>Allowing AI derived work creates a conundrum.  Could copyright/patent trolls utilize machines to file endless applications. A mere attestation alone won&#39;t be enough to stop application onslaught because there is no way to legally snapshot an AI black box at the time of discovery/creation. Nor can any person now actively look inside the black box and understand how it works. <br/><br/>It continually evolves (the AI) and thus trying to prove infringement is impossible with a huge legal onside deference. There is a great potential that future trolls and allowances (of such work) would hamper innovation greatly in that individuals will be subject to perpetual legal research and lacks the implied creativity (for protection). <br/><br/>Lastly training set data containing copyrights (graphics/artwork) should be a violation. As its a derived use of the original work. <br/><br/>
