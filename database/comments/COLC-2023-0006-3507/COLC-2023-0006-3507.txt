I think the current use of AI, specifically using machine learning to generate &quot;novel&quot; content based on training from existing copyrighted works, is an egregious violation of copyright on a horrific scale. I believe these models should immediately stop being used and trained unless they can verify all the content used for training is properly owned or licensed. Public domain content should be allowed for training, however.
