Until there is an efficient way to determine whether or not A.I. generated images were legally and ethically sourced, all A.I. images should not be able to be copyrighted. This is because most A.I. images source copyrighted work without consent of the creator, as most A.I. programs currently do not limit themselves to open source databases. If you can copyright an image that breaks copyright laws, this would be a massive oversight, as said laws would become pointless and arbitrary.
