If we allow automation into Hollywood, we will see Los Angeles become Detroit. We will drive past old studios and say, &ldquo;people used to work in that place.&rdquo; Make no mistake, this has an outsized impact not just on writers but on America&rsquo;s standing in the world. We currently export culture. And that gives us an outsized sense of humanity around the globe. Other countries know us, see us, laugh with us, share pain with us through our art. Automate that and what are we but a global police force.
