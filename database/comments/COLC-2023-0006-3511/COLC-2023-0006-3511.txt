It should not be possible to copyright AI generated works (whether in AI is used in full or in part). There are already too many cases where AI has been trained on written works or artistic drawings without the permission of the original creator. Which is hurtful to all creators, but especially independent artists or small businesses. Artificial intelligence requires more regulations especially regarding data sourcing and machine training.
