AI models are trained on existing data fed to them using visual or written media before anything is generated. I believe it is impossible to completely guarantee that all data given in AI training is sourced with consent and knowledge from all artists and without copywrite infringement. As a result of this, it should not be possible to copywrite AI generated work. <br/>Additionally, the purpose of copywriting art is to protect the unique spirit of creativity we as people possess. AI and computers cannot create art on its own, there is no creative process or ideas to protect. If anything, there should be more regulations protecting artists from having their work, words, or voices used in ways they do not consent to.
