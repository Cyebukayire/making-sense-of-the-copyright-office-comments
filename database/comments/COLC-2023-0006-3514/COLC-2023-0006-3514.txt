AI created art is theft in the same way that writing a novel by pulling individual paragraphs or sentences from other novels would be. It&#39;s not creating anything, it&#39;s using what&#39;s already been created to satisfy an immediate want. The use of AI and calling it &quot;art&quot; diminishes what makes the creative process unique, and it threatens the livelihood of true creatives. Artists spend their lives working toward building a skillset, and their efforts reflect that. AI just takes what they&#39;ve already done and smashes it all together without regard for the work. Once it&#39;s truly understood what AI does to manufacture a thing, this shouldn&#39;t be, in all honesty, a question.
