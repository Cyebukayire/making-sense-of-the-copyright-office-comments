I think AI should be catagorized as transformative work and protected under fair use. Transformative work includes things like fanfiction, where people write amateur and informal short stories, novellas, and novels using already existing characters, settings, and worlds without having to pay studios or publishing houses royalties for using the content found in the existing work. If copyright were applied to AI, then why not apply it to fanfiction writiers of https://archiveofourown.org or fanfiction.net and have the pay a sum for using the work of a more established creator? Why not let visual artists who draw Marvel or Disney character of their own volition be open to being sued for copyright infringement? <br/><br/>AI should be treated as a transformative work and be allowed to be freely used in parody, criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.<br/>
