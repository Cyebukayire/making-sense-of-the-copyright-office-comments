As AI is right now, it is a violation to copyright law, Intellectual Property, and privacy. It is being trained on people&#39;s images, writing, artwork, and voice without consent from the person they are being taken from. This is now being used for monetized productions by not only individuals but companies, like Amazon, who are making money without doing any of the work or getting proper consent from the original creators and not compensating them while making millions. This is a disgrace and a violation of the highest degree.
