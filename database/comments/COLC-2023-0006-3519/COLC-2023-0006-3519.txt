I believe that AI generated content should not be available for copyright protection. <br/>By its very nature, AI generated pictures, books, etc. take from existing creations made by other people to hobble together its own amalgamation. There is no creative process involved, nor any effort or ingenuity on the part of the person applying for said copyright. It is literally a leeching process which, if allowed to be copyrighted and protected under law, will drive actual creators out of work and dry up the well of creativity for everyone. It is an uroboros that will eventually devour itself if it is left the only creature in the market. People can do as they will, but if there&#39;s monetary gain to be made by copyrighting AI content, it will be exploited to the detriment of all.<br/>Thank you very much for your time and consideration in this matter.
