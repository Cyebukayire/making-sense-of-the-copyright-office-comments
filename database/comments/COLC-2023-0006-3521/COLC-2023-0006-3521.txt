Hello, <br/><br/>I&#39;m commenting here today as an artist, writer, and creator. Since the use of AI has increased over recent years I have watched my work, along with my peers, have our work uploaded without consent to AI databases. <br/><br/>The problem with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and other AI programs like this is that the data sets containing all of those images are based on hundreds &amp; thousands of others&#39; work. Real human artists&#39; work who were not approached, not asked, and even in some cases people have built AI databases specifically to replicate another artist&#39;s work. Which as you can imagine can be harmful to that artist&#39;s career and livelihood.<br/><br/>In its current status, the use of AI in a creative space is theft plain and simple. All of the datasets that have been gathered and created off the work of other artists. Whether this is drawing, painting, photography, music, really any creative medium. <br/><br/>There needs to be boundaries and regulations in place for this to protect people and creatives. <br/><br/>These boundaries and regulations need to be set in place and properly regulated before we can realistically address other components of AI as it is not all bad obviously. It has many applications across many fields that are beneficial and even in the creative fields can be used to minimize time needed to work on a project.<br/><br/>But until these regulations are in place and protecting creators many of us creators will not see AI as anything but a threat to our livelihoods and futures.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and I hope you&#39;re able to see the damages and repercussions this will cause if not addressed.<br/>
