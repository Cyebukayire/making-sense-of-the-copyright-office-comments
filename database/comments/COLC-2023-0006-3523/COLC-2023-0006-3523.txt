I will address the issues this order:<br/>(1) the use of copyrighted works to train AI models; <br/><br/>I believe this is already covered by US copyright laws. Copyrighted works cannot be lawfully reproduced, in whole or in part, without permission of the copyright holder.<br/>LLM&#39;s to date have been trained on copyrighted works without the authors or copyright holders&#39; permissions. Since copyright on original created works is automatic under US law, virtually all AI&#39;s produced to date have been unlawfully produced, and the sale or transmission of them infringes the rights of the authors of the copyrighted works used to produce them.<br/><br/>(2) the copyrightability of material generated using AI systems; <br/><br/>I don&#39;t see how they could be copyrighted, or who could be said to own the copyright of a work that has been algorithmically built from a compilation of the works of humans, without creative input. The whole purpose of LLM&#39;s is to remove human creative effort  from the process of making new works. If anyone could own such products, it would have to be the AI itself, but it is not a person, and if it were equivalent to a person, the practice of slavery is banned so the creative work could not belong to the person who employs it without a contract of employment between the putative person (the AI) and the user.  <br/><br/>(3) potential liability for infringing works generated using AI systems; and <br/><br/>Juries are able to decide whether or not a work is infringing when it comes to human-produced copies. No new law is needed to cover the situation except to clarify who is responsible for the infringing product. If an AI produces output that is found to be infringing, it seems like this would be the fault both of the AI creators and the user who prompted it to produce that output. Joint and several liability should be the rule.  <br/><br/>(4) the treatment of generative AI outputs that imitate the identity or style of human artists. <br/><br/>Imitating the identity is already considered to be fraud. That should be obvious. Imitating the style could be protected speech, but it seems impractical that a AI capable of doing so could be built without ingesting mass amounts of copyrighted material into the training data, which can&#39;t be lawfully done. See my response to question 1.
