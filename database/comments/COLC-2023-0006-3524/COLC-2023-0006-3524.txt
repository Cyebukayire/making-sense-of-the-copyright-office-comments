Artificial intelligence art and bots are &quot;trained&quot; by taking real art and writing from others without permission and simply copying it. It is theft and should not be allowed to use. Too many artists have had their art stolen and fed into an ai image generator, only for it to give an exact or near exact copy of the art. Many artists and writers have said they do not give permission for their content to be used to train ai, including well known authors. Again, taking the works of others and giving it to ai without permission, or with the creator&#39;s direct refusal to allow it, is theft and should therefore be illegal.
