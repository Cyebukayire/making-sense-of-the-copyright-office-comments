There is nothing &quot;intelligent&quot; about AI-generated imagery. Without the work of human beings, it would be nothing-- it will never create on its own. And that work belongs to the human copywriter holder. That being said, corporations might own the copyright to assets created by artists they hire, however it is unjust to allow them to pay an artist one time only to turn around and use their images in perpetuity in an AI&#39;s library. If that practice is allowed to continue, it will no longer be feasible to make a living being an artist. Bottom line: AI and the companies or individuals who use it are exploitative; their output only exists thanks to artists and actors, and this technology is clearly being used to skirt around fair compensation and attribution.
