I live in Texas, and I believe that AI data scraping is very harmful to creatives. I am a writer and people have already scraped my stories off of the platform Archive of Our Own (AO3) and put them into AI writers to write stories in my style and even publish them. It is disheartening as a creative. Many sites that create AI-generated content have not specified where they have scraped their data from, and it is very possible that it has scraped from copyrighted content, as well. AI is harmful to both small creators and copyright-holders.
