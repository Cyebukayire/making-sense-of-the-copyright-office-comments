We need strong regulation and legislation for AI. It is running rampant and contributing to misinformation online. As an artist, it pains me to see how people use it in lieu of learning and developing a new skill. I am fine with AI art being used in a manner that doesn&#39;t take jobs away from creative people, but AI as it currently stands just scrapes the internet of art and steals them without any crediting. AI should be something that we opt into, and not the &quot;new norm&quot;.
