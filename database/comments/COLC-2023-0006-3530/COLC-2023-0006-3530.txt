Thank you for seeking public comments on the subject of Artificial Intelligence and Copyright. <br/><br/>I am a supporter of artists and authors who make their livelihood on the art they create, and feel that the strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time is vital.  While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.  To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.<br/><br/>I strongly feel that the Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors and artists of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration in this important issue.
