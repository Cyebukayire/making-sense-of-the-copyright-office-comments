I don&#39;t think AI should be used in creative endeavors, academia, or anything that requires the user&#39;s thoughts, creative skill, or opinions. AI in these applications could be considered plagiarism; the methods in which artworks, &amp; articles made with AI often take copywritten material where the copyright holder(s) have no control, consent, or compensation.<br/><br/>Both academia &amp; the arts are the brain, and heart of our society, we shouldn&#39;t be cheapen what should be a foundation of our society. I personally am an artist, who would absolutely love to share my hard work with the world, however I&#39;m scared of having my artwork stolen in this regard.
