If you combine ingredients in a pot and light the fire, who cooked: you, or the pot? Elements given to A.I. to create something works in the similar manner. The credit should be shared between the human (for providing the elements), and to the A.I. (for developing with the elements given). If artificial intelligence creates purely on its own (not where we are technologically speaking) the copyright should go to the artificial intelligence. We all learn from someone else, somebody else&#39;s works, and build upon what has been done. Artificial Intelligence learning from publicly available work (as long as it doesn&#39;t make a direct replica of a work) should not violate copyright. In the event that A.I. creates an original work of its own accord, the copyright should go to the A.I., not the company that owns the code, as the company itself did not create the work.
