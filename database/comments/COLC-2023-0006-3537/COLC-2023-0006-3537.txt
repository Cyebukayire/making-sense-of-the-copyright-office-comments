AI works should not be permitted for copyright. Already artists are losing their original pieces to AI generated images. This impacts their ability to make a living. Allowing copyright protection to AI would also negatively cut into the living of actors. If they cannot own their own self image film companies can wholly eliminate the need for actors. Nothing about AI is made by a living person, it feeds off of the creativity of others. It is a program. Therefore it cannot be given the same protection as a person.
