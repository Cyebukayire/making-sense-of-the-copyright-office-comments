AI is infringing upon the creativity of humanity to put it simply. Humans have spent decades upon decades, centuries creating all for it to be amalgamated into some unknown AI created &ldquo;art&rdquo; with no credit nor permission from the original creators. In order for art to be art there has to be feeling, meaning behind it. There is no intention, feeling, behind an AI generated piece that someone wrote guidelines for. It&rsquo;s why our actors and writers are on strike right now, AI cannot replicate the human experience so why are we trying get it to reach that point? The answer, to me and many others is, is should never get there. By regulating AI generated content we are giving more control back to us, as humans, to decide what and where our art goes. AI may be used to inspire but it cannot replicate a person&rsquo;s writing, art, etc. If my stance has not been made clear, I do NOT condone AI nor it&rsquo;s integration in creation as opposed to real people creating in society.
