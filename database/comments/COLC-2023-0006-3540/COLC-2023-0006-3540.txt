Intellectual property and copyrighted intellectual property need to be federally, legally protected from being unconsentingly used for AI training and as basis for AI works. Content creators need the opportunity to make informed decisions about AI scraping, and should have the choice to opt in or out with every piece of media they create. Those seeking profits off of AI laziness should be required to obtain explicit consent from EVERY creator their machines pull from, EVERY time they do so, and should be required to properly compensate for the labors of our society&rsquo;s dreamers, thinkers, and visionaries. They are our future. They are worth more than another quick billion for soulless corporations. Our future is worth more than that. The imaginations of the American people are distinct from automation and always will be. We demand to be treated like it.
