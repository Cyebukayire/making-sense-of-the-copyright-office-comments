Hi there,<br/>My name is Christina Dirkes and I work in film and television. AI as it currently stands is being allowed to start, and, under the guise of an open license, scrape the internet and all existing COPYRIGHTED material in order to train its program. Then, once the program is trained, since it says it doesn&#39;t retain the copyrighted information, only uses it for training, it becomes a for-pay product.<br/><br/>The training on copyrighted material CANNOT be decoupled from the fact that the training is being used, in the end, without permission, to make a for-sale product that displaces workers. We&#39;re already seeing this with online publications: AI now writes articles, and entire staffs have been laid off as a result (see Buzzfeed, among others). The main issue is that this training on our work is being used for something that will be used in perpetuity and used as a lever to NOT compensate workers. This can be for visual art, written art, sonic art (voice acting), and even, one day, actors themselves. Currently Hollywood film and TV studios are making scans of background actors and want the opportunity to use that likeness, without compensation, in perpetuity.<br/><br/>Whatever the regulation are moving forward, they need to provide for the fact that AI is replacing entire jobs, and not only replacing jobs, it is using OUR WORK to gain the abilities to replace those jobs. If our jobs are being replaced in perpetuity, we need to be paid for the job in perpetuity. These companies need to be motivated to continue to use real people because if our country switches entirely to AI, then swathes of people will be out of work, and more money will simply go to those at the top, and then who is going to buy the products in our country and stimulate the economy? The 1% can&#39;t do that, and the lower and middle class NEED jobs in order to buy American products and stimulate the economy. If our work is going to be used to replace us in perpetuity, the companies need to pay those it&#39;s replacing, also in perpetuity. That is the only thing that will motivate them to choose to hire humans: if it&#39;s the same price as AI.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Christina Dirkes<br/>91606
