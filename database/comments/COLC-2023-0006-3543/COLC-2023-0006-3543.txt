If any person has to pay corporations licensing fees, for use their often purchased, intellectual property&mdash; then the same rules should apply to the AI a corporation or individual has created/is in use farming content to learn.<br/><br/>Why do corporations get to abuse the rules? Here resulting in them avoiding spreading wealth in the economy to the individuals or persons who created the content they farmed from in the first place. What it then leads to corporations getting more rights than an individual&hellip;. again. Economic stagnation, personal right and property violations, etc&mdash; these are the results. But if this country&rsquo;s courts and government leaders only care about the lobbying corporations money in their back pockets, why should the individual continue to support that government?  <br/><br/>A person in poverty wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to steal from the rich without consequences. If we let the people behind these corporations continue to steal, regardless of physical tangibility of the intellectual property or otherwise&mdash; then I am gravely concerned for the future of this country and the world. It&rsquo;s a slippery slope. What will they take next before people decide to take it back? Theft is theft. Its only a conversation currently instead of something worse because of the power imbalance. People in this country are struggling with hunger, homelessness, poverty. And all they care about amidst the suffering is stuffing their pockets with money made from ideas they STOLE. Whether an AI program did the stealing or they did. It makes no difference. Disgusting.
