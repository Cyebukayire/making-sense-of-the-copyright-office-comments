I am writing as a working novelist who is deeply concerned about the federal government potentially granting copyright protection to AI or LLM authored (or assisted) texts. The Constitution permits the issuance of patents and copyrights to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts,&quot; but allowing machines that function by stealing words and ideas--often without the opt in or consent of the original authors--to obtain those same protections would hurt actual human creators. Publishing is a &quot;useful art,&quot; and my subcategory, romance, may be the biggest slice of the pie. According to Fortune, 47 million romances were sold between March 2020 and March 2021. Those books generated income for their authors, for the publishers, for the editors, for the marketers, and for the bookstores that sold them, not to mention enjoyment for the millions of readers who enjoyed those stories. Allowing books that are wholly or partially the product of intellectual theft the same protections would have a deleterious impact on the industry as a whole, and on the individuals in it. It is honestly bonkers to me, and contrary to the Constitution, to contemplate this. Please protect American writers and the American publishing industry by rejecting this idea.
