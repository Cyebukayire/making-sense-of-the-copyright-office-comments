AI should not be able to hold copyright on anything it creates. It is just a bunch of programming code that can only emulates human created works (which feels dangerously close to copyright infringement as is due to the way they&#39;re &quot;trained&quot; on existing works) and not a human consciousness capable of actual creativity. In this regard it should have no more ability to hold a copyright to a generated work than a dog with its paws dipped in paint and allowed to run across a canvas freely. In addition, people entering prompts into a AI program shouldn&#39;t be able to hold copyright on whatever comes out of it because anyone could type in the same or a similar prompt and get a near identical result, again eliminating any true human creativity or learned talent or skills from the result. AI is more like a tool that can be used to create references or starting points for a human to then use in truly creative works, but in itself is merely one tool out of a set. Think of a single paintbrush, a pen, or a chisel; one single tool that has the potential to be wielded to create great things, but by itself should have as much to do with copyright as the graffiti in a typical high school bathroom stall.
