<br/>Neither An algorithm nor Artificial Intelligence should be able to get copyrights since copyrights are exclusive to human entities. <br/>The users of said artificial intelligence should neither be eligible for copyrights since their contribution to the creation of the content is close to none.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Given the nature of artificial intelligence generated content, it should be illegal to sell or profit from it, since it is not human, nor it has a human mind, nor it has any other human characteristic, and it is currently competing on human markets against humans. Furthermore, given it&#39;s nature, AI generated content should be available without consumers having to spend any money on it or exchanging our personal data for it.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>AI Generated content will destroy our creative markets by over saturating it, and diluting the value of human workers, if we let it compete against humans. <br/>The working class will not benefit from competing against Artificial Intelligence, only the companies that created it will do. Which in the end will mean the elimination of the middle class, and will create a much bigger gap between rich and poor.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>We know that AI generated content can be unique in the sense that does not resemble any previous creative work (most of the time), however we know that those algorithms were trained using our copyrighted work, our intellectual property, and is now devaluating our very same work competing against us.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Copyrights exist to protect the value of human intellectual property. Copyrights are the backbone of any industry that relies on creative people. Without copyrights, we are back to the wild west.
