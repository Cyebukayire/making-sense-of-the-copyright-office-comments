I am a graphic designer and a writer and unregulated AI is stealing my livelihood with no credit whatsoever back to me. I have rights as a copyright holder and unregulated AI is making them meaningless. Regulations are common sense and will protect me and so many others, opening the door for me to safely be even more creative and innovative without risk to my livelihood.
