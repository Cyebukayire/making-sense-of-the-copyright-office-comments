AI Art is a Blight to All Artists<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI generated works of media are a blight to artists of all varieties as their works have been wrongfully collected, altered and reworked unknowingly and unwillingly for the sake of crediting others who don&#39;t put in nearly the same amount of work or effort to create art. It is an attempt to undermine and undercut the effort of artists so that companies do not have to compensate them for their labor. AI art doesn&#39;t serve anyone other than the lazy and unskilled, and massive corporations looking to exploit artists for their creative works. <br/><br/>It is demonstrably dishonest for &quot;AI artists&quot; to claim their &ldquo;works&rdquo; as legitimate, when in reality their pieces are nothing more than an amalgamated mishmash of other creator&#39;s actual works. This applies to all forms of AI, and boils down to minds lacking the necessary creativity to make their own works; in other words, these individuals have a skill issue. Many may draw comparisons to photography, but such claims are also misleading, as photography is meant to be used to capture our environment, not for capturing creative works, unless for press purposes; and even so, still requires skill to do, as you need to have good lighting, positioning, camera work and editing experience. <br/><br/>Fair use also does not apply to AI art, as no human is generating the works put forth, technology is. While it is true that art requires some level of technology to exist, to completely remove the human element aside from stealing existing works to be a foundation, is a line that should never be crossed when considering the legitimacy and validity of art. Art, regardless of medium or tools is at its core, a form of human expression. Machines are simply not capable of expressing themselves in this manner, so to claim that they do so when the human element is otherwise absent is a mischaracterization of art itself on a fundamental level. <br/><br/>People defending the use of AI may desperately wish to be as creative as their artistic peers may and claim that these tools help them to do so, but in reality they are simply taking the easy way out at the expense of real artists. The reason why this is all so damaging to real artists, is because not only are their works being used against their will by tech heads running billion dollar companies and their lazy pawns, but also because the very nature of it is exploitative, and could undermine the value of their work that had to be earned through years of practice and generations of human experience. Art has been with mankind since its very inception, and to disregard that effort for the sake of laziness is disrespectful to all notable artists who have died, both in history and in recent years; they all deserve better than this.<br/><br/>In conclusion, AI art requires no work aside from filling out a mindless prompt and pushing go, with the same mental effort of watching a gumball swirl down a machine with childlike wonder. It is theft in the most blatant form, reaping the rewards off of the backs of actual artists with little to no credit given if any. It removes the human element entirely, making the claim of it truly being art laughable. And lastly, it is actively harmful to artists by being a scapegoat to financially supporting the artists that put forth actual work for art to exist in the first place. A word of caution to those wishing to tread the path of AI art: not only is your work illegitimate, but it would not have existed had it not been for the millions of artists your AI has stolen from. You all will never and cannot ever call yourselves &ldquo;artists&rdquo; if you do not put forth the work and effort required; and eventually, your AI will have nothing left to pull data from as the artists you have actively chosen to harm will stop making works due to not being able to financially support themselves. Try as they might, a machine is still just a machine; not a person.<br/>
