With regards to IV. The Current Inquiry:<br/><br/>(1) Copyrighted works to train AI modules - If you want to train AI, you should have staff at a company take time to create work explicitly for training, rather than feeding literary, audio and artwork that is copyrightable. Work that is in the public domain, maybe, might be better. But work that is copyrighted and subject to royalties? Unless you&#39;re going to pay those creators it is theft. <br/>(2) Copyrightable material produced by Gen AI - Gen AI is pulling the data from somewhere to make their outputs. Whether you feed art into MidJourney AI to &quot;create new art&quot;, or you&#39;re feeding audio into a Gen AI program to imitate an actor&#39;s voice. You are still stealing from the original copyrighted work. There is no workaround with that, it is theft. You are altering something that is not yours and attempting to call it your own. If I take a copyrighted piece of art and add a stripe of color on it, does that make it mine? No, it&#39;s stolen (and vandalized) work and not eligible for copyright. Gen AI output should be treated the same for it is not a human that is creating the work from their own mind. There is no way to guarantee everything processed through GenAI was done with consent, and therefore would have to be treated as theft.<br/>(3) Liability for Infringing Works generated by AI - Similarly as with (2), the concerns of generative AI being copyrightable is an infringement on the original creator&#39;s works. For example, let&#39;s say a company records my voice and inputs it into GenAI programs without my explicit consent. Anything they create with my voice should not be copyrightable. The benefits and risk of liability outweigh any good that could come from making GenAI works copyrightable. Artists and content creators are already out there fighting companies that are stealing their work and feeding it through GenAI programs - it will become harder for genuine, unique art by a human to exist if the threats become copyrightable threats.<br/>(4) GenAI output that imitates human identity and art styles - This should go without saying that it is a safety and security risk. An actor, let&#39;s say, being manipulated in an AI program that creates a video wherein they spout hateful rhetoric could lose their career, their livelihood just because the video generated by AI is out there. As an auditor I can only imagine what risks of financial fraud and theft might exist if someone could input their bosses&#39; voice into a system so they can steal from their company. If I can think of it now, you can bet someone will think of it later and *use it*. Making this work copyrightable will be a massive concern for the courts down the road. <br/><br/>Overall, I do not see how this is a question. You can save yourselves, and millions, a lot of headaches if you rule that generative AI work is not copyrightable. There is never going to be a perfect way to ensure consent was given for the work being fed into these programs - you simply cannot monitor all the corporations, the individuals, that would use these programs in the future. There are too many ways to steal, to hurt and to ruin those that are putting in the time and effort to create these works. Even someone having a Zoom meeting with their co-workers or family needs to be concerned if their voice and video are being recorded for training because the consent is not as explicit as it should be. Voices and likeness may not be copyrightable, but the threat of misuse is a big one and not one that can easily be thwarted if generative AI work is copyrighted. <br/><br/>While I am sure I did not cover all the questions outlined in the Federal Register, I want to make it clear I cannot see a way that generative AI works would have a benefit that would outweigh the risks to human (and corporation) financial security and safety. I see way more avenues for misuse than proper use, and the biggest item to consider is CONSENT. If explicit consent does not exist you are merely opening a can of worms.
