AI has the potential to create anything faster then humans can. They can simulate lifetimes of experience in a matter of hours - what is to stop them from also creating a life times worth of art in a matter of hours or days. If that work can be copyrighted, it will only serve as a detriment to human created works. The same types of people that are patent trolls will create programs to churn out art with the soul purpose of going after people legally to make money.<br/><br/>Digital copyright laws are already hot garbage as it is without AI created works in place, they would only become worse when trying to enforce such art.<br/><br/>Copyright laws should be limited to and restricted to human created works.
