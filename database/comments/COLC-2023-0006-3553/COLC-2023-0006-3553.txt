I think AI can be a useful tool, but given the way we treat working artists in this country, I feel that it will mostly be abused to force them out of jobs and steal their work without needing to pay them. Heavy restrictions should be put onto what kinds of data AI can use to train itself and there should also be ways for the creators of that data to be compensated by the creators/owners of AI technology who are using their work.
