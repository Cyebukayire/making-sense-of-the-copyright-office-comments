I am of the firm belief that AI models should not be allowed to use copyrighted data in their training without the explicit consent of the copyright holder. It is, without a single doubt in my mind, an act of plagiarism and an affront to the copyright holder&#39;s stewardship over their work. If the developers of AI models wish to use the work of others to develop technologies, write papers, or produce products, they should be held to the same standard as everyone else when it comes to correctly attributing what they have borrowed to the original creator. Much like a student must cite the sources they use to write a paper in a proper, regulated format with concrete rules, AI developers must also be held to a standard of conduct that I feel can only be enforced by strict copyright law. &quot;AI&quot;, a broad term that is applied to everything from simple, rudimentary code to actual machine learning, can not be exempt from the responsibility of respecting the rights of the creator&#39;s they inevitably exploit. <br/><br/>As such, AI-generated material should not be able to be copyrighted. Who would even have the copyright to such a thing, some product produced from an amalgamation of the works of copyright holders that neither consented nor participated in its creation? <br/><br/>&quot;AI&quot; should not be a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot; for developers to plagiarize copyrighted material they have no rights in the name of their own profit. They may own the code they write, but they have no right to the works they steal and shred with it.
