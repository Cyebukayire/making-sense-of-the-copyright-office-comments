The human brain works by taking in sensory input, then it runs cognitive processes on said input, and then it produces a novel output, in the form of a thought or an action. This is essentially the same way that a Large Language Model (Ai) works: they have an amassed knowledge bank of sensory inputs (their training data set), they are able to run multiple processes on the input data, and then they produce a novel output in the form of a written article, generated image, or other such format. - The issue relating to copyright seems to be that of compensation and/ or attribution for any artist who contributed prior art to the model of an Ai generator. For example, if prior art assets are used by an AI-image generator, those assets are likely to have been produced via literally thousands of different bits of other images, and the human originators of said prior art may want to be recognized in some way. As a method of bulk compensation, a computer system can catalog every bit of information that it pulled from a prior-art source, and it can note that unique art ID in its&#39; metadata. This means that an Ai-generated output may effectively have metadata with over 1,000 different contributors listed. Those contributors would each get a specific amount of compensation in the form of a Micro Royalty (.00001 cent per image generated with each piece of prior art). Each month, a contributor of prior-art would get paid for their contributions in the form of a residuals check for the money they earned over that month. They would simply need to register for the payments with the various services. It&#39;s similar to how TV actors get residual checks for tv shows they appeared in.
