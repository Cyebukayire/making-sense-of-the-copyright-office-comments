AI should not be copyrightble because many works created by AI are generated from existing work that was created by real people and is copyrighted, often without permission. If a movie studio creates an AI to sound exactly like a deceased actor does the actor&#39;s estate get residuals for the use of their late family member&#39;s likeness? Does an AI trained on a particular artist&#39;s style steal audience from the original artist? Who is credited for these works? It disincentivises people from making new work because it will simply be used to teach AI. The very human act of creation should not be plugged into a program and have all credit given to a machine.
