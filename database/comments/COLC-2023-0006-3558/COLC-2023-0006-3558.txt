Hello, I am a digital artist and would like to voice my thoughts on the matter, and am answering selected questions that I feel I can fully answer.<br/>I&#39;ve included what I believe to be my most pertinent thoughts in this comment box, and have have added other answers in a .pdf, thank you for your time.<br/>I firmly believe that text/images/audio generated by generative AI systems should continue to be non-copyrightable.<br/><br/>1. As described above, generative AI systems have the ability to produce material that would be copyrightable if it were created by a human author. What are your views on the potential benefits and risks of this technology? How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, technology developers, researchers, and the public?<br/><br/>I believe that gen. AI systems can be a great tool, if they are regulated properly. However, I do not believe that is currently the case. Current AI database models were/are trained via a scraping model that can and will include a creator&#39;s copyrighted, human-made work without their consent(myself included.) To use a metaphor, in my opinion, it seems to be like making a cake, but the recipe book &amp; ingredients are stolen from a nearby baker, and our hypothetical thief has a robot that can bake cakes and does not do any of the work themself.<br/>I am most familiar with AI image generation technology, but I am very worried about the rise of AI vocals &amp; video generation. Singers &amp; actors that make a living off of their voice &amp; likeness may be put out of work due to people with AI being able to generate their voices for songs, movies, slander, etc. Not to mention it can be used for misinformation &amp; political agendas - I believe it should be regulated, but I am genuinely unsure as to what stature should be used to do so.<br/>I believe that AI generated images, audio, and writing, should not be copyrightable as they were generated via trained machine learning and not via human creative output.<br/><br/>5. Is new legislation warranted to address copyright or related issues with generative AI? If so, what should it entail? Specific proposals and legislative text are not necessary, but the Office welcomes any proposals or text for review.<br/><br/>I believe new legislation is a necessary must. As I have mentioned before, so-called &quot;deepfakes&quot; using AI is a topic that I find extremely worrying - AI generating likenesses &amp; voices of people without their consent/knowledge, often used to slander/mislead - but I am unsure of a copyright legal standpoint by which to curb such practices. AI systems needing to require informed consent from the people involved won&#39;t stop bad actors, but I believe it would be a step in the right direction.<br/>I am unsure how to tackle vocal likeness generation and generation of public figure&rsquo;s/actor&rsquo;s likenesses, but I believe legislation should be passes so that one&rsquo;s likeness and voice cannot be used in generative AI without first getting consent from the individual. <br/>Also, for image generation, much of the datasets were scraped from various sites, which as of writing this, is illegal. So legislation to strengthen that/enforce it would be a welcome step. <br/><br/>9. Should copyright owners have to affirmatively consent (opt in) to the use of their works for training materials, or should they be provided with the means to object (opt out)?<br/><br/>I am firmly and strongly in support of opt-in system. It is the basis of most of my dislike with generative AI that they made the system opt-out with no real way to opt-out. One could opt-out of one database, but that does not mean that their work has not already been scraped/that another database will respect that opt-out.<br/>If image generative AI had been opt-in from the start, many of my current grievances with it would be nonexistent. I would have been willing to submit some of my artworks to the databases, instead of having them used without my consent or knowledge. <br/>I am unsure if I can stress this enough. I believe that AI can be a useful tool, and it&rsquo;s fun to play around with - but as it stands, I have reservations about using it. <br/><br/>32. Are there or should there be protections against an AI system generating outputs that imitate the artistic style of a human creator (such as an AI system producing visual works &ldquo;in the style of&rdquo; a specific artist)? Who should be eligible for such protection? What form should it take?<br/><br/>I don&#39;t believe that there should be such protections, given that &quot;style&quot; is something incredibly hard to define, and I fear that it may be abused if a precedent is set. Some artists may happen to have a style influenced by a certain piece/genre of artistic work, does the law apply to them as well? I believe that AI generated works should not be able to be copyrighted, and I hope that that will encourage people to go to human artists who have copyright when dealing with commercial products.
