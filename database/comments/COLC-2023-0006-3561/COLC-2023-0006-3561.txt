As a freelance digital artist with over 15 years of professional experience and a BA in Game Design and Graphics, AI generated content is a considerable concern for me as both a professional and as a private individual. On the professional level, AI generated content does not feel as a particularly great threat to my livelihood as a replacement for my services, but it is and will continue to be a significant source of confusion for much of my clientele as to what my professional services mean to them. The &quot;art&quot; generated by AI may superficially appear indistinct from what I and my professional peers have spent years to learn how to create, but since AI is dependent on source and reference material created by humans like my peers and myself, it is little but a vague imitation. For educated individuals and/or professionals, the distinction between human creations and AI generated content is easy to make, but to our laymen clients there is no guarantee that they are capable of seeing the details that make art distinctly human. AI therefore is as much a threat to consumers as it is a threat to creators. <br/><br/>When a consumer employs the services of another person, what guarantee can they expect that the services are indeed provided by another human? Would it be acceptable to go to a five-star restaurant and pay for the fresh, genuine, human-crafted item and instead get a factory-produced dish? The same must apply to all forms of human services. Is it acceptable to rely on an honor system where a person &quot;promises&quot; the genuine thing for its respective price? The challenge that AI generation creates here is that the generated item may be 99% indistiguishable from the genuine article and laymen cannot be expected to know the difference. If they pay for the genuine article, then there is no excuse to not provide them with that article, even if the article is 99% similar to the real thing.<br/><br/>If AI development is allowed to continue unregulated, then it will affect more than just 2-Dimensional art. It will affect the music and film industries. It will inevitably affect journalism and threaten the perception of reality that the average citizen has a right to be informed of. A right to be informed by humans who are aware of how other humans read and react to their reporting. What guarantee is there that AI will provide any person with an accurate depiction of reality, and not just a 99% accurate guess where that missing 1% could lead to disastrous results?<br/><br/>As AI generation evolves, it cannot be expected of the average citizen to weed out the AI generated content from the genuine articles, and potentially lose money in the process. If a person decides to program an AI to generate news, art, films and/or music with the false promise that it is created and curated by actual humans, then the people purchasing this service are being scammed. It is imperative that AI is regulated for the benefit of the consumers as much as it is for the benefit of human creators.<br/><br/>The only solution to these potentially life-threatening risks to humans of all walks of life is to maintain that only human creations may be copyrighted and that AI generated content may not be monetized. It is not enough to demand AI content to be marked as such to protect consumers from having their trust abused. Ignoble people cannot be trusted to not skirt the rules and continue their harmful practices. It will cause consumer skepticism on a level that could very well destabilize whole industries. As long as AI generated content may be sold for a profit, it will be the greatest threat to the creative industries in history.<br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to voice my concerns.
