content created by AI is no-one&#39;s intellectual property, as the person didn&#39;t create anything. They gave the AI a prompt and it scraped thousands of REAL PEOPLE&#39;S art to create some soulless combination of images or text or sounds. the most the person &quot;owns&quot; is the prompt they typed for the AI to use. Not to mention the countless people using AI to create sexual content of people without their consent, even going as far as to create AI Child Sexual Exploitation Material. No AI-made content should have copyright to it until the current bots are properly regulated and don&#39;t exist to steal.
