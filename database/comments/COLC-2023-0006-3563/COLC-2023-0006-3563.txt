As an analyst and technical writer working in the healthcare industry, I am concerned about the welfare of patients who may be directed to information and advice generated by a machine learning algorithm. I am concerned that patients will be provided with false, misleading, or potentially harmful information that could negatively impact their health, when such content is widely spread and made readily available.
