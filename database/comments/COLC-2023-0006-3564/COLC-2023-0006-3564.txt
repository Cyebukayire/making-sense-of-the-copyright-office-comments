I am a US citizen living in Canada. I have been a professional translator for 9 years. Machine translation with large language models has been available as a tool during my entire time in the industry. The widespread use of this tool has caused a race to the bottom in the industry with downward pressure on compensation. What&#39;s more, I don&#39;t think translators have ever been properly compensated for their intellectual property which has been used to train these machine learning models. The spread of these tools to other industries has stolen from even more writers and artists and threatens their future earnings. Copyright should be for humans.
