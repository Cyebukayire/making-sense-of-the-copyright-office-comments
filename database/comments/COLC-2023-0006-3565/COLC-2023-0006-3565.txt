Currently all AI models are trained on already copyrighted material created by other individuals, and then when prompted create a generated text based on what they have found to be the most likely strong of letters and words. There is no thought behind its creation. It is not a truly artificial intelligence, just a more advanced auto complete. What&#39;s more, the work being used to train AI is usually used without permission or compensation to the original authors. If copyright is to be awarded to AI created works, then credit, compensation, and consent must be applied to it like when a real person references or uses another person&#39;s work.
