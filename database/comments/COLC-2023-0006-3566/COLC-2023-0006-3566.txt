Hello,<br/><br/>While AI can be a useful tool it has been shown to cause more harm to creatives than helping. Like many others I write stories and put them online for free to anyone interested in reading them. To have my work scrapped for someone else to profit not only cheapens the process but ignores the hours, sometimes months I spend on my craft. I have many colleagues who feel the same when their artwork is scraped for algorithms to load into places like Midjourney and such. With respect to innovation, I believe there has to be at least a middle ground where we can move forward with technology without surrendering the arts to machines. Creatives already struggle with supporting themselves selling their crafts, to have AI hedge them out farther does everyone a disservice.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
