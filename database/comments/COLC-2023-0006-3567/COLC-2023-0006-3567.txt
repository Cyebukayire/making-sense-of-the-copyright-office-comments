I&#39;m an author and A.I. has done inreputable harm to the publishing industry.  I am a self-publishing author and the flood of poorly written A.I. books have made it impossible for readers to find real human books on Amazon and other third-party sellers.  It is also responsible for the lowering of the page rates for Kindle Unlimited,  Amazon&#39;s author program to the lost rates in the induction of the program&#39;s creation.  It is a publishing nightmare because as authors many of our works have been taken and scrapped without compensation or consent. It becoming increasingly dangerous for authors to feel like they can trust their own community.  And at the end of the day, it&#39;s authors who do not make a decent living as it is, having to pay for A.I. generators infiltrating our industry without care for intellectual property rights.
