I am a National Bestselling Author of fiction, a writer of canon fiction for an Emmy-winning Netflix show, and a fanfiction writer by hobby. AI - which is not intelligent at all and whose very name gives a false sense of expectation, performance, and veracity - is a threat to every level of publicly available written information. Text both factual and fiction-based - all written by actual humans with earnest intent to create and share - has been scraped and blended and poured back out to be slurped up, with a variety of disastrous results all around.<br/><br/>Health matters produced by AI chatbots or articles will affect quality of life and endanger lives without a proper medically trained human involved. To whom should a sufferer complain when they follow horrible advice in good faith?<br/><br/>Everything from big-name authors&#39; published novels to little-known fanfiction stories are being scraped so AI collators can toss out new books of highly questionable quality at a ridiculously fast pace. If you thought the 99-cent wave of self-published books ten years ago was &quot;trash fiction&quot; please think again. Those were written by actual humans who genuinely wanted to write stories. AI collators who drop a new book every three days are out here redefining the meaning of the grind - and ruining expectations for readers, and disrupting the trust between authors and their audiences, especially when they can so easily choose to deliberately copy another author&#39;s style. To whom do we complain when unaware readers buy those books and an author has their steady stream of income dry up?<br/><br/>There are currently no regulations protecting anyone from any sort of AI scraping. But we already have the term &quot;plagiarism.&quot; I would like to see its definition expanded to include AI scraping. I feel it&#39;s a good fit. Collators are literally taking others&#39; words without permission and attempting to pass them off as their own creation. They&#39;re even asking for money for their products.<br/><br/>There are several crimes involved in how AI is invading various aspects of the written world, like so much kudzu. But the worst crime of all, I feel, is how easy AI makes it for everyone using it to simply stop thinking entirely.<br/><br/>Just like the AI.
