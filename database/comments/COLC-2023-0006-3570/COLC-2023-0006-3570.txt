AI is largely used to create things, trained on by the work of others, entirely without consent. Voice actors are having their very voices taken away from them without their consent. How would that work in terms of copyright? Can someone really own the rights to another person&#39;s voice? Can they lie and say they were given consent?<br/>Many artists have had their art used to train AI without permission. Sometimes, the people generating AI art with these artists&#39; work use it to scam people out of their money by claiming they can create a piece by hand. See, the price of art isn&#39;t solely based on its quality, it factors in the time it takes to create each piece, the years spent honing the skill. Yet people will charge hundreds of dollars for something they did not create, generated by AI in a matter of seconds. It is in no way comparable to the hours artists spend on each and every work.<br/>No one should be allowed to copyright something they did not create. If you ask an artist to draw an image and provide them a prompt, do you then own that image simply because you told them what to draw? No! That&#39;s not how creativity works! AI is a mockery of creative professions. It is used by people who do not respect the skills of human creators. It is built off of stolen content.
