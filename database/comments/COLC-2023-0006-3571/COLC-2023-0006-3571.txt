As an artist, author and creator, I believe AI generated art and media does not meet the criteria of original creation and should not be eligible for copyright protections. The product of AI is not an original work, but rather a patchwork of material scraped by a computer and reconstructed into a facsimile of art per a programed algorithm. Furthermore, the material gleaned by these programs are the copyrightable and copyrighted creations of human writers, artists and creators, often without consent, making AI as it currently stands a form of plagiarism.<br/><br/>I urge the U. S. Copyright Office to deny any copyright for AI produced material and establish guidelines that reject AI copyrights as well as protect the copyright of the original creators whose work has been taken without permission or compensation to program AI generation, including but not limited to scraping the internet for blogs and articles, scanning books, news articles and other original writing, and social media postings made without and opt-in for AI usage from the original authors.These all constitute non-consent usage and plagiarism via AI.<br/><br/>I thank you for your work protecting the original work of creators and hope that you will continue to protect us through this and future shifts in technology.
