AI inherently violates copyright and takes advantage of the intellectual work of others. AI is dependent on what it is fed and the person with access to the AI isn&#39;t getting permission from the people whose creative work it exploits. There also isn&#39;t a good way to verify that the person using AI only used their own work to train said AI, which is the only time it might be considered non exploitive. Even in that case at best it would be a transformative work which while not illegal is not eligible to be copyrighted itself. It should not be allowed for sale purposes as it is taking advantage of previously done labor of others to create profit for those who have done nothing, its a form of digital slavery.
