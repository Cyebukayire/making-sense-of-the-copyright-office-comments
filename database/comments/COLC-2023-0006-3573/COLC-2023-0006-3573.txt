I think it should be almost impossible to copyright AI generated content.<br/>Images that are artificially generated are based on the best photographs in the world and are created using a few simple lines of text.<br/>If AI is only used to remove, for example, an object from an image, the image as such should be copywrightable.<br/><br/>There is no artistic creative process behind the creation of AI generated images.<br/>These may sometimes be quite funny or useful to quickly illustrate something, but it should also be heavily regulated.<br/><br/>AI images should also be marked as such by news or social media platforms. The dangers that come along with this are unmanageable.<br/>For example: Influencing elections, fomenting hatred, creating fear and terror, more fake news<br/><br/>The criteria for whether an image should be protected by copywright or not are:<br/>1. is there a greater creative process behind it than just writing a few lines of text?<br/>If no, then no copyright for the creation.<br/>2. is the AI only used to remove objects from a picture or to extend the background? <br/>Then it should be copywrightable.
