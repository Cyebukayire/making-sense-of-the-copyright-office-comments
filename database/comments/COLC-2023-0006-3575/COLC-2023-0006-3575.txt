AI is supposed to be a tool that helps further humanity and the culture we create but instead its being used to erase it<br/><br/>Companies and individuals with power are chosing to further disenfranchise workers and artists by using this software to steal ideas from people whove worked years to refine them. Art is about inspiration and recreation. Some of the best movies wouldnt have been made without the director seeing something else as a kid and taking inspiration, thats the beauty of art. Thats the beauty of being human too, because if art can be made at the click of a button whats left for the human experience? Creation and innovation is relegated to something that can be done without working and without experiencing life? Without human creation and innovation, whats left for humans but work?<br/><br/>AI art should not be eligible for copyright because it goes against the very nature of what it means to discover, innovate, and create.
