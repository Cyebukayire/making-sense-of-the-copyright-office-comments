Submitter name: Vanja MitroviÄ‡<br/><br/>1) AI Generative technologies are being used to sidestep copyright; often absorbing licensed, copyrighted work in order to build their for-profit databases. Various images, personal photos, even client work that has already been paid for and exchanged ownership has become an input material. Not only is there *no* permission obtained to create derivative work, but the original is used as part of a wealth obtaining process. <br/>2) The AI generated images are not being used for research, personal reference or as part of a human process. The raw input is being generated from an aggregation of illegally scrapped data in order to obtain: ad revenue, engagement, or to promote sales. AI services are often locked behind paywalls (observe monthly subscription of Midjourney and others)<br/>3) No license or royalties: The process of AI generative training does not consult nor obtain license for input material being used. The unique nature of new technology sees everything available online as free input for profit making. And the business itself is built around the idea of &quot;free labour&quot;. High fidelity results in the AI are the result of the quality of the input material used for training. <br/>4) The raw AI output conflicts with the economic interests of the copyright holders it obtains data from. Machine reproduction can produce output in thousands, easily drowning out other participants and putting a severe strain on any platform&#39;s upload capacity. No human can output 10+ completed pieces per day. This leads to platform destabilization. AI created imagery and human made art compete for the same space. With a grossly different upload speed, the possibility of discovery for a human artist has dropped very low. Artists and prompt writers should not share the same space on basis of fair competition alone. Crowding out is a form of unfair competition- it is impossible to retain visibility for your value when the relevant tags and communities are flooded with hundreds of derivatives.<br/>5) Machine reproduction should not be conflated with human-made work, simply because of its nature. It is a mechanical use of training data, utilizing each pixel in the base material, as opposed to a human being taking inspiration.There is an enormous difference between humans viewing another&#39;s work and combining it with years of training in order to produce something, versus using an entire product as a base in an automated process with minimal human participation. It is the GAN doing all of the work- and the prompt user most often didn&#39;t even train the AI network they use themselves. They requests the end product. <br/>6) AI generative technologies are prone to memorization and overfitting. The model&#39;s output can be very close to the data it is trained on, making it nearly the same as the input material. AI generative models depend on collecting the copyright holder&#39;s work in order to create &quot;a latent space&quot;- an approximate distribution of pixels acquired from the original input image. This makes AI inherently dependant on the images it uses for the training process.<br/>7) No transparency and no curation of source material being used as AI database material. Many of the publically available AI image generation models do not transparently disclose the sources for training their neural networks, or use copyrighted material that they have not obtained a license for. It is impossible to know what stock the AI generative model uses. <br/>8) Unlawful data collection. Some websites allow third party programs to  collect hosted images for AI data generation without letting their users know their personal information is being used. Impacted parties have been unable to make informed decisions because these data vendoring policies were changed without accessible and adequate notification. <br/>9) The nature of AI generative training process: In order to train the generative AI to mimic a style, a &quot;dataset&quot; of multiple illustrations is required. The base images are then denoised to create a latent space- a context in which the AI will re-combine the pixels. Latent space consists of images that are downsampled into lower dimensional representations and then reconstructed during the process of upsampling. It is the reason why the AI generated imagery has context- in other words, why it knows where to put fingers or moles. This can lead to generated imagery sharing identical elements as their source material. Such as hair strands, curves, eyes. <br/>10) The AI is not a tool. Unlike using brushes/stocks/textures- which can be obtained through purchasing, or for free depending on the creator&#39;s wishes, AI generation relies on entire completed artworks to approximate their data, so it can faithfully mimic the targeted style. The models depends entirely on existing, premade labour that it incorporates into it&#39;s work process. <br/><br/>More:<br/>https://twitter.com/TrevyLimited/status/1685617421325885440 , https://www.pixiv.net/info.php?id=9540<br/><br/>
