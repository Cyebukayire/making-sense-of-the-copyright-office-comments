I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good or safe at all. AI is trained using real people&rsquo;s work, without their consent and often even knowledge. Additionally, for AI that copies voice actors, it&rsquo;s outright dangerous  as their voices could be used to say things they didn&rsquo;t. I think it&rsquo;s an insult to pay a computer to create art when we have humans that can make it, and better. Additionally, for things like chatGPT, there have been multiple cases where it was inaccurate/or inferior to human answers, and gave users inaccurate information. For unsuspecting users, that&rsquo;s also a problem since they may not have a way of verifying the AI&rsquo;s accuracy. Ultimately, I think it should not be used in anything related to art or academia as it steals from real people&rsquo;s work and isn&rsquo;t accurate enough to be used widely and safely, and think restrictions should be placed on art related AI software to ensure that artists whose livelihood depends on their work being commissioned don&rsquo;t lose customers to people that stole their hard work to recycle into lower quality content
