My approach to the AI copyright issue has come from the same angle as a commissioned copyright. <br/><br/>Since, in essence, a commissioner may provide an artist guidelines or detailed requests for their commission, the foundation of it is quite similar to the way the AI generates its result. A commissioner may be very specific in their requests and in their choosing of mock-ups or multiple versions. No matter how specific the original commission, an artist (unless they are employed or under contract specifying otherwise), retains copyright over the produced work under current law. <br/><br/>The AI is not a human and cannot keep copyright over the things it creates, as has been established in previous legal decisions. Even if the current controversy of AI using already copyrighted work as training material did not effect the ability to copyright said creations, the AI, as the current technology stands, is not complex enough to agree to a contract of its own volition and thus couldn&#39;t be under Work for Hire rules. This means that the user, in this view, would never be able to fully copyright the results of the AI &quot;commission.&quot;<br/><br/>That being said, with the legal precedence, I see no reason for an individual using an AI to retain copyright over the produced images. Regardless of the potential issues arising from AI trained on copyrighted material, the user would not actually be creating said document, but rather issuing requests as to what that result would look like. <br/><br/>I also have some further questions that I do not have a solid legal answer for. If an individual does claim copyright over an image, for instance generated by terms such as &quot;young woman, factory worker, bandanna&quot;, how far would that claim cover? To what extent of similarity would that individual be able to utilize their copyright over others using the same terms, or with a similar image that the AI might generate? The limits of machine learning do often reduce the range of images produced in order to properly match over time. Data pools are often inherently biased, meaning that an issue with copyright between two images that the same AI would generate is inevitable. To grant AI users copyright over the works that the AI produces would have to be incredibly specific in order to be reasonably enforced. <br/><br/>With the dramatic splash headlines that come from lawyers or large media companies using (often to their detriment) AI, it is best that this issue is addressed quickly. I am not on the side of the AI in this situation, nor the side of the users who wish to copyright the results from the AI. The potential for misuse is high, and the endangerment of the already undervalued arts community is more than concerning. Though I have made my stance clear, I hope you come to an appropriate decision with the same gravity that this issue is due.
