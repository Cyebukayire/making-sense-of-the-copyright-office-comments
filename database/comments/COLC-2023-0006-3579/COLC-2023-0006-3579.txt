As an artist and writer, I feel that AI offers many beneficial uses in the creative field. However, it should never be used as a replacement for human artists. The use of AI in commercial applications should be heavily restricted: an AI should not be allowed to be the credited creator of a work, and any use of AI in production should come with a requirement that all creators whose work was incorporated into its learning database are also credited and duly compensated. I believe we currently stand at a crossroads of diverging paths, and the morally correct choice is the path that prioritizes our ability as humans to create. That being said, the answer to this issue is NOT to allow the copyrighting of unique art styles. This would only be used as a smokescreen by large corporations to monopolize the field of creative work and keep small artists from finding success. To allow this would be as anti-human and anti-art as allowing full unregulated use of AI and is a path that must be avoided at all costs. We must curtail the harmful applications of AI but not at the expense of human enterprise. We must curtail the use of text-generating AI to replace professional writers, the use of image-generating AI to replace artists, the use of voice-generating AI to impersonate actors and politicians, but we must not curtail the ability for humans to create art. Restrict the commercial applications of AI, not the limits of art itself. As stated before, AI has many possible beneficial applications in all fields of work, but if we allow it to replace the value of human labor then we have failed as a society.
