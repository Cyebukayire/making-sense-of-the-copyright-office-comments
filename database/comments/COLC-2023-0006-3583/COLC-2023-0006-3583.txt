We desperately need regulations on AI; have for a while now in fact. I&#39;ve been watching the growth of these programs and the speed at which they&#39;ve been affecting people&#39;s lives is terrifying. Between programs trained on artists work without their consent, AI being used to replace people in certain jobs, and the use of AI to create fake images (which can lead to misinformation at best, or potentially ruin someone&#39;s life in the worst possible case), something has to be done, please.
