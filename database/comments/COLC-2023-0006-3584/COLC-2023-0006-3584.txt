Artificial Intelligence, when it comes to generating images, is a destructive tool. It was created recklessly, with no regard given to artists, photographers, and other creatives. Machine learning scrapes the internet of millions of images, with no regard given to who holds copyright to said images, and plagiarizes the work of the originals with no credit or compensation given to their creators. Protections for musicians against AI have been put into place by major record labels, but no such protections exist yet for visual artists, as we have no such legal representation of that scale. The community that has grown around AI image prompters and users is actively hostile towards artists, and they do not care that this technology threatens our livelihoods that we all painstakingly work hard to achieve. Please rule in favor of human artists, and the true creative industry at large.
