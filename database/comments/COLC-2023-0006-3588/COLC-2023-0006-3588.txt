Due to the way AI content is generated, it cannot and should not be subjected to copyright. It shouldn&#39;t even be called AI as it is more accurately machine generation. Theft of others&#39; work without properly agreed upon compensation should not be allowed to run rampant, which it is currently doing if any number of the inaccurate AI generated content you see nowadays is any indication. Disallowing it to be subjected to copyright would make it easier for actual content creators to have cheap and fraudulent imitations of their works taken down and would limit the self-cannibalization of AI feeding on other AI generated content, which causes a mess of things really.
