I am commenting to tell you my opinion on A.I. A.I should not be used for art or writing material as the A.I may be programmed to use existing artist&#39;s, voice actor&#39;s and writer&#39;s work without the consent of the artist, voice actor and writer themselves. Companies will use A.I as a way to avoid paying people fairly which will cause a lot of people to be out of a job. A.I has been used to &quot;fix&quot; or add to an artist, voice actor or writer&#39;s work which is very disrespectful towards them if they did not consent to this especially if they are deceased. Using A.I is not a skill, all someone is doing is telling an A.I to do something which is does, the A.I is doing all of the work all the person is doing is telling the A.I what to do. This is not the same being an artist or a writer as artist and writers spend time practicing and doing what they enjoy by themselves, they are not telling an A.I to do it for them. A.I should be used in ways that can benefit everyone instead of just benefiting the person using it without disrespecting anyone alive or deceased.
