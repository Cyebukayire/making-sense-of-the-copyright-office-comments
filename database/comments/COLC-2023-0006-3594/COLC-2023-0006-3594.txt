The Copyright Office has a duty to mitigate or outright stop the uncompensated and uncited use of artists&#39; work to create or &quot;teach&quot; a program that will inevitably undermine the artists and their work. It is distinct from other forms of crowd sourcing, which typically requires some form of opt-in, and a perceived benefit to the user.
