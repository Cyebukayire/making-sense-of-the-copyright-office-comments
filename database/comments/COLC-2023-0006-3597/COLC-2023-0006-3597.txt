AI/Artificial Intelligence has been noted to steal artists work, as it works by compiling images/text it takes from the internet, stealing it, and doing something with it. It removes watermarks in terms of artwork, and it plagiarizes writing. Half the time, the things it produces doesn&#39;t even make any sense.
