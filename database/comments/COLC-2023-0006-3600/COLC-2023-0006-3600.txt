It seems to me that Copyright Laws should not protect anything produced by AI. AI is not creating anything. It is taking the work and style of other artists and copying it.there is a difference between being influenced by a great artist and basically stealing his style. I  also believe that every AI program should legally be required to list every artist whose work was used to compose it&#39;s output.
