As an artist I&#39;m deeply worried by the trajectory of AI so far. It seems that every day I hear about a new use of AI to scrape people&#39;s intellectual property without warning or permission and use it for some other purpose. If AI is going to continue to be developed and kept legal there need to be some serious copyright and other laws put into place to protect the work of actual real human artists. Can&#39;t we develop AI to make our grocery lists and bus timetables and staff the McDonalds so that we humans can make art?
