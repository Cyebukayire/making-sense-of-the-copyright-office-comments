My name is Sophie Tananbaum, I am a SAG actor, and I am concerned that the lack of regulation against AI is a threat to my profession and livelihood. Major Hollywood studios wish to use actors images and likeness in perpetuity, which is a major violation of my rights, not to mention a serious lack of financial compensation for this. I am also aware that if studios wished to use AI to create artificial performances as a way of avoiding paying actors and performers, the AI is still trained by using existing performances. As such, the work created by AI is only able to be created by leeching off of already existing work. I feel actors, writers, directors and creatives who made existing work that trains AI should be fairly compensated for this. At the very least, work created by AI should not be allowed to be copyrighted, as again, art created by AI is not original. If there is no federal regulation of AI put in place now, I fear for my career and for the film industry as a whole. Film and art is inherently about humanity, and original, human made work is integral to this. This is skilled labor that we are talking about replacing. I am in no way discrediting the numerous ways AI and similar technology can advance society. However, replacing art is certainly not one of them, nor is profiting off of others work without compensation.
