To whom it may concern,<br/><br/>I am writing because I think the USCO&#39;s current stance on generative AI content is inconsistent with other forms of mechanized artistic creation.<br/><br/>Photography is an art form that uses a machine to generate imagery.  Yet, the individual using the camera is granted copyright over the resulting work.  This seems to be because the simple act of choosing a shot is considered enough creative input to qualify for copyright protection.  If just the act of aiming a camera is enough creative intent, then why is a prompt not considered enough creative intent to qualify generative AI content the same protections?<br/><br/>The argument I saw made was that a prompt is like commissioning another individual for a work.  However, that argument seems rather absurd.  The generative AI software is not an individual.  You are not asking it to produce an image for you, but instead operating the software and establishing operating parameters.  Those operating parameters directly impact the result produces and are creative in themselves.  As such, the work produced should be granted copyright protection.  If generative AI content is not granted copyright protection (when operated by a human, of course), then photography should not be granted copyright protection either.  After all, a camera actually produces the image, the individual operating it just directs it towards what they want produced.<br/><br/>If instead the argument is that generative AI technology relies on using machine learning software to study the works of other artists, that is also a rather poor argument.  After all, artists themselves study the works of other artists to learn their craft, generally without permission or compensation.<br/><br/>Arguing that the model produced through this process infringes or is a derivative work seems rather unfounded, as the model produced is not substantially similar to the works studied during the machine learning process.  In many cases, the model does not even contain directly comparable information.  Instead, the model represents the artificial neural network&#39;s understanding of the elements it learned from, allowing that learned knowledge to be leveraged by other software.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I see no reason why generative AI content should be treated differently.  The purpose of copyright is to allow individuals to profit off their produced work.  When one produces generative AI content, it is their produced work.  Others should not be allowed to use those works without permission simply because the individual used technology to assist.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Christopher
