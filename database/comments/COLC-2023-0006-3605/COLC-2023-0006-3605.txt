AI (the existing versions anyway) have learnt via human input (scrapping social media etc.). It hasn&#39;t learnt from just one person and since a lot of social media is driven by bots, then it&#39;s learnt as a human would. i.e. if a painter was taught at college/university, the tutors can&#39;t claim copyright from the students work once they branch out on their own. How is that so different from AI producing works of art? The AI has produced something from how it was taught to see the world.
