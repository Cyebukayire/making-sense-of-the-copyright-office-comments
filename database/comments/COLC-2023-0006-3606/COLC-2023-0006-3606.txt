The training and content generation of AI mimics the process that humans use to learn their craft. They do not retain copies of the works used to train them. Claiming that generating new content after training with copyrighted data is a violation of copyright is like claiming that humans should not create content after consuming copyrighted media themselves.  Unless the content they generate violates a copyright of another artist there is no copyright concern related to their training or use. I believe these AI models should be encouraged for the good of mankind and concerns about copyright should not be considered valid. Eventually, I expect that we will have AI that rise to the level where they will deserve to be granted their own copyright on the material they generate but for now, I believe that the person using the AI should be granted that copyright.
