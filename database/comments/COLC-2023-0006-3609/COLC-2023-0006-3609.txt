The products of an AI shouldn&#39;t be copyrightable in my opinion because they are an automated process that is prompted externally and have no creative process behind them. They are predictively generated content that samples from other already existing works through an iterative process that has to be trained by external feedback. The AI itself makes no creative or aesthetic decisions and functions as an elaborate filter. There is no actual &quot;intelligence&quot; involved.
