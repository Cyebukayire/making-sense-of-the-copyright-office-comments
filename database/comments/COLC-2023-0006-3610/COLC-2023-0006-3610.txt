Copyright protections are vital to wellbeing and livelihoods of artists. At a time of economic stress, the arts are the first victims deemed &quot;less important&quot; than things that are viewed as necessities. Though from a utilitarian viewpoint this may seem logical, it is important to remember that artists are workers providing a service just like anyone else. Copyright protections are the most basic necessity to protect real working humans. When AI is allowed to generate on stolen artwork, it not only violates copyright law, but it also harms human workers. It harms artists who are then deemed to be too expensive, when the AI is a cheaper alternative. We cannot rely on good faith business owners to continue commissioning human artists, because in many cases their bottom line is a higher priority than continuing to employ people.<br/><br/>Nor should AI be given copyright protections for the images it creates, especially in cases where that AI was trained on stolen work.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
