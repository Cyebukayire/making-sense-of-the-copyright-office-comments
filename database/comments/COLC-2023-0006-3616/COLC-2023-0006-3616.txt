Listen &hellip; if you made a collage in real life . You would be in charge of what elements and from where they were taken. Also a human person would be involved in the creation of this piece . If a computer chooses all the content itself (albeit supposedly using the descriptions you give it) and perfectly replicates a piece of art that was already made . Did that person make it? In my eyes, no. Especially when the robot MUST use art that is already created by others . Could you go to a bake sale and sell box brownies and even claim you made them ? Yes, but internet reality you are only &lsquo;creating&rsquo; a product someone else made.  All I really want to say is AI will bite itself in the ass if it&rsquo;s used mainstream. It is literally nothing without the work of thousands of unwilling participants that &lsquo;train&rsquo; the so to make pictures
