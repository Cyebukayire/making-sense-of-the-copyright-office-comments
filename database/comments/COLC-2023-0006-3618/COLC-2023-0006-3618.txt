When used correctly and ethically, A.I. could be an extremely beneficial tool for a lot of development. However, a massive issue in the usage of A.I. is the protection of copyright for the material that is in the database of the A.I. itself. Most A.I. generators currently have a database built off content that the original creators did not give any consent to be used as part of the database, which is a massive issue. The creators of such types of A.I. and some of its users, such as corporate entities, are stealing and profiting off stolen content, and something has to be done about it.<br/>I strongly believe that artwork, literary works and other types of human creative content - which are at the greatest risk following the rise of unregulated A.I generative engines - should be protected. Making artworks are not easy, and most artists - especially artists whose content are used in A.I databases without their consent, and thus violating the essence of copyright itself - have undergone non-stop training for years so as to produce their content. Art and human creativity has had an invaluable role in improving the quality of human life, and should be treated as such. We cannot let art forms that has existed for millennia of human history, and/or has become an integral part of daily life, become endangered because of existing shortcomings regarding regulations of building databases for A.I. generative programs. Therefore, I believe that stricter and tighter regulations have to be created to protect creative content of all types from being exploited by A.I. producers.
