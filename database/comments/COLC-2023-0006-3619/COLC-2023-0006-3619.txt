Quite briefly, Artificial Intelligence must be heavily regulated and certainly so when it comes to it using the intellectual property of others.  Frankly, the AI usage of anyone else&#39;s IP needs to be documented meticulously so that the original owners of the IP can partake in ownership of the new amalgamation of data, if they choose to allow their IP to be used in the first place.  The original owners need to give permission for this.  If they don&#39;t give permission, then the usage of their IP should be prohibited by law.  All AI IP usage should always be transparent so that the sources may be checked by anyone at any time to ensure legality.  AI can also help to check other AI in this concern.  If AI cannot be feasibly regulated in these ways, then it should be purely illegal for AI to use the intellectual property of anyone at any time for anything, except possibly with the exception of material that has fallen into public domain.  This last point of public domain is up for debate in my mind.  Thank you for your attention.<br/><br/>Best, <br/>William Boodell<br/>08.31.23
