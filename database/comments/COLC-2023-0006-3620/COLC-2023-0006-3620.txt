As we know &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is a misnomer applied to a form of bias reinforcement learning and that AI media generation relies on preexisting creations to develop a final result by &quot;training&quot; the AI to copy media fed into it, remove the components in those original medias to assemble them in a format recorded as most acceptable based on the overall patterns of the aforementioned original media and then &quot;blurring&quot; the assembled fragments into a cohesive form, it is impossible to argue that the works are not derivative. Furthermore, as we know &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is incapable of understanding if the artworks fed into it as a base to develop the final result and their ownership all legal responsibility falls on the person(s) that inserted the artwork to &quot;Train&quot; the AI media generator. So from a position of copyright there is only one possible conclusion, that 1:no AI generated media can be allowable for copyright as a derivitive work which developed without ability to fall under &quot;satire&quot; or &quot;fair use&quot; due to not comprehending these concepts and 2: all rights relating to AI generated media must default back to the rights owners of the original work therein, with the AI generation program being responsible for recording all media used to &quot;Train&quot; it for a given image for legal reasons.
