AI should not be allowed to generate content based on copywritten works, especially in imitating an author&#39;s style while not citing the author in question. Ethically, who owns works generated by AI or other chat bots? The company who made the software or algorithm, or the human author whose work was scraped to &quot;teach&quot; the algorithm what stories are? AI created works should be considered plagiarism.
