As a former library employee, current voracious reader, and long-time fan of the Terminator universe, I vehemently oppose &#39;artificial intelligence&#39;. It may be artificial, but it is not in any way intelligent. It does not learn, it simply repeats back what human beings have created, pushed through an algorithm with little to no coherency. There are those who argue that as this tool is responding to input from a human, that signifies enough human input to justify a copyright. <br/><br/>As a former library employee who spent quite a large amount of time assisting patrons in their search for information, a good keyword search in a database does not mean I have the rights over whatever material I find. AI prompts are just another type of database search. And what of the database this algorithm is searching? It&#39;s created most prominently via theft of already copyrighted materials crafted by actual human beings. Materials taken without compensation, permission, or knowledge of the copyright holder.<br/><br/>This activity is devious and should not be allowed to go forward, much less rewarded. The companies creating these depositories have the resources to include an opt-in process and should be required to do so. <br/><br/>The purpose of copyright is &#39;to promote the progress of science and useful arts.&#39; AI does not promote the arts, and there&#39;s an argument that it can set science back, as it as already become a vector for both the dissemination and creation of disinformation. <br/><br/>In short, I oppose the grating of copyright to users of AI tools, and encourage the Copyright Office to look into restricting, or possibly banning, the wholesale, uncompensated use of copyrighted material to &#39;train&#39; said tools.
