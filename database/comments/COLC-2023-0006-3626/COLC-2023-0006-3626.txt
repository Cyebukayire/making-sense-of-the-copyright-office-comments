I believe generative AI should be regulated as the programs are not creating, they are pulling from databases of art that they do not have legal rights to and then outputting works that greatly resemble mashed together pieces from the database. If companies are allowed to continue using these programs artists will lose rights to their work and income, and plenty of people in the entertainment industry will lose their jobs. For the general public, AI does not have creative freedom and so stories will become bland\unreadable. Shows will become hard to look at. Overall the only people gaining anything from generative AI are the CEOs who will take home more and more money as they require less workers to put out whatever &quot;entertainment&quot; they want at the expense of artist rights.
