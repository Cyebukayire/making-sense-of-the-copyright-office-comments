I am a Costumer for the television and film industry. AI causes an existential threat for the future of my career. Currently costumers are needed to dress, attain and keep track of of costumes for every single person on camera. With AI, the people on camera will be computer generated, which eliminates the need for the jobs of thousands of people in my position as well as many other related careers within the industry. I have been costuming for 17 years and this is the first time I felt like my career and way of life could be completely compromised.
