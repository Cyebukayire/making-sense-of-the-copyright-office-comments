Thank you for opening this comment line. <br/><br/>AI generated content cannot belong to anyone by nature. The only entity that could claim to have created any given AI generated image or text is a computer, which can only do so by mimicking examples from human creators. As we do not currently recognize any computer as sentient, then there is no one for the copyright to really belong to. The human component in AI artwork is negligible, as feeding a single prompt to a program with no telling what it will generate is too hands off to constitute ownership. This is especially true because these programs are trained on examples of human made art and writing. Most institutions do not condone plagiarism when a human is doing it, and I do not believe we should tolerate it from any other entity, especially when it comes to attempts to copyright.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time
