I am grateful for the Office&#39;s desire for public feedback. I am an artist and writer, and I am often worried about my work being used without my consent. This applies to the use of it in training generative AI as well. I believe copyrighted works by creators should not be used to train AI unless the creators give explicit permission and receive compensation. It is disheartening to see other artists being affected by this and giving up posting their work for fear of it being used or stolen. I also believe images and writing created by AI should not be eligible for copyright.
