AI is trained using datasets of copyrighted works, and if it is allowed to continue doing this, it will cause a trophic cascade of changes that will undermine copyright&#39;s purpose to &#39;further science and the useful arts&#39; by making it impossible for people creating that copyrighted work to be fairly compensated. It will also undermine culture and art, which arguably is what makes us human. I am an author, and not only am I concerned about AI undermining my ability to make a living, but I am also concerned about the idea that AI could be fed all of my work and spit out a fascimile that is passed off as mine without my permission, damaging my reputation and stealing my artistic identity. I have spent decades learning, training, practising, and finding mentors in my profession, and have devoted myself to adding to the great body of creations that makes up art in my culture, to add to humanity&#39;s collective consciousness. A machine algorithm does not have any ability to &#39;create&#39;, only to regurgitate what it has been told. And additionally, studios like Disney have already begun taking steps to replace human beings with AI created images of those human beings, without compensating them for their voice and appearance, which should belong to them and has until now unalienably belonged to them. People have always received fair compensation for their work, we call this residuals and copyright and royalties--all I am asking is that the law spread to force AI to adhere to those extant laws and practises. The creators and programmers and users of AI projects must compensate EVERY artist and creator for work they feed into their AI, and must not be allowed to decieve anyone about the authorship of the product the AI spits out. This is not a new demand, this is just holding them to the same standard as everyone else using copyrighted work.
