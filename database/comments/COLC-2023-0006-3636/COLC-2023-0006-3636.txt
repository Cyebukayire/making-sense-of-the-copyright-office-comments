AI should have never been used for creative work in the first place. It makes it so the humans do backbreaking work and the robots get to create art. But since we&rsquo;re here, I will say that NO AI should be using anyone&rsquo;s work without permission from the creator. And that means contacting the creator and making sure they fully understand what is being done. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s theft. And if they say no, it means no. No going behind their back. I still believe using AI for creativity is a horrible idea. But if they must, they must do it with consent or not at all.
