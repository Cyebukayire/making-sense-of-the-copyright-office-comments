Hello, I am writing to assert that we need regulations on AI.  I live within the United States and the state I live in has no regulations relating to this issue. As we are continuing in the age of technology, the rapid pace at which Artificial Intelligence usage is growing needs stronger government intervention. At this point in time, there are little to no regulations that stop AI from plagiarizing from the works of all creators in various fields that have worked hard and studied their crafts for many years. AI has been used for malicious purposes like stealing art works, written stories, and personal data information that was not consented to. If no action is taken soon, there will be even more damage done to the whole of our society in many fields that can&#39;t be fixed. The federal government is responsible to protect all of its citizens from the misuse of AI. While states only have so much power to regulate AI, much like the states of California, New York, Hawaii, and Oregon, there should be a standard that has more explicit restrictions throughout the whole United States of America.
