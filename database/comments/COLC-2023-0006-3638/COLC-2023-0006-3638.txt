It is ridiculous for someone to take another&#39;s work without permission and benefit from it by feeding it to their &quot;AI.&quot; It is theft- the use of stolen work should be punished, and no company should be allowed to profit off stolen work. Even if you argue that the work is original from the AI, the AI was trained from stolen work, everything it &quot;creates&quot; is and should be considered theft.
