Ai should be upheld to current copyright laws (excluding copyrighted content from its dataset), should be able to prove that it&#39;s dataset utilizes public domain content, and should have their datasets be public domain as a result. The ability to use an artist&#39;s or a writer&#39;s work without any reference, and without any permission, is despicable. Currently, artists seek to create overlays that will protect their works from being parts of an ai dataset by using a noise filter to &#39;poison&#39; the dataset. This only applies to ai datasets illegally using their art as information and part of the edited picture. We&#39;re it used as reference in the sense that a true artist uses it, namely as inspiration, the noise would not appear. Ai is a push and go editing software for existing images, and so long as one of the possible images in its list could be copyrighted or used without the artist&#39;s permission, it should be intelligible for copyright of its own.<br/><br/>Make datasets public domain. Make the companies behind these AI accountable.
