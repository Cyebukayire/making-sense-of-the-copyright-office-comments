AI should not be able to be copyrighted in any capacity. Copyright should belong to a real human being, not a robot. AI as it stands, merely compiles/steals art and information already published usually without the publishers consent. Every artist and author I know agrees that anything generated by AI is curated in an unethical way. Many artists have had their works stolen by AI. Many voice actors have had their voices stolen by AI. <br/>AI is a problem to the one thing that separates us from apes. The ability to create. AI encourages people not to study and appreciate art, but receive instant gratification by stealing other&rsquo;s works and using it as their own. AI art/voice/writing in any form is plagiarism and shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to be copyrighted.
