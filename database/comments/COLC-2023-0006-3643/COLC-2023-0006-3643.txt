While each author or artist draws on influences from other arts, in order to create their own original works, they also draw on their own life experiences and cultural connections that they make outside of the context of any of those individual art forms. Generative AI, as a system designed to create content, as opposed to art, doesn&rsquo;t have life experience, or non-contextualized influences to draw from, and incorporate into its own output. The integrity of an artist&rsquo;s rights to control the works that they&rsquo;ve made in part from their own human experience is essential to preserve. Otherwise, we risk a bad feedback loop of large language models or other machine learning algorithms training on other machine learning systems, and crowding out human Artists, and their creations, reducing the innovation that artists have always brought to their individual fields.
