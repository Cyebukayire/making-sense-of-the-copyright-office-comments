I believe AI-generated works should not be excluded from copyright eligibility as a blanket regulation, but that it should have to meet certain criteria to be eligible for copyright. Some examples may include:<br/>* The work is clearly identified as being created with generative AI tools, in whole or in part<br/>* The work includes the prompt(s) and/or tools/services used, or includes some clear way to locate this information<br/>* The work has been transformed by human creativity in some material way (more than just light editing or color-correcting) (subjective)<br/>* The work is being submitted unedited, but as part of a larger work that is primarily human-generated, rather than independently (such as an unedited AI-generated image(s) that is part of a collage containing primarily human-made images)<br/><br/>Additionally, copyright of AI-generated works should not protect those works from themselves being used as training data for generative AI, or otherwise being transformed by other generative AI tools or persons using them, provided the new work(s) meets all other standards for avoiding copyright infringement.
