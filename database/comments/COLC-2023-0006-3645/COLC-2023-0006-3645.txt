I&#39;m not a US citizen, but a Canadian performer, who largely writes his own material. Artificial Intelligence should not be allowed to infringe on copyright protection or be allowed to steal the likeness or work of others. This will massively degrade our rights as artists and employability. The ease with which AI could be applied at little cost would also be devastating because it would be hard to contest each case. Art is a human endeavor, and its simulation by CEOs is also an effort to exploit the already weak status of most artists paid by them. AI also has dangerous implications for other areas of life, particularly in law enforcement and military missions and should be disallowed there, too.
