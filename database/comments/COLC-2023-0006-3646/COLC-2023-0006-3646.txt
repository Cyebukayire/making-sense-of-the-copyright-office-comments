Artificial Intelligence is a grossly exploitative technology at this time, with many AI entities openly scraping information from already copyrighted or otherwise personally protected works, whether that&#39;s in the realm of audio, video, and even written text. Because AI technologies serve as an amalgamation of such a wide body of work, and because the information scraped is often difficult or impossible to interpret in terms of point of origin, any body of work may potentially be included as part of the output of an AI technology. The idea that this technology, which by its nature requires other existing work to contribute to its production, would be allowed to then copyright that production is immoral, and flies in the face of the purpose of such protections. Do not give AI produced works any such protections.
