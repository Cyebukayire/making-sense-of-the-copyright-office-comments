I believe that content generated by artificial intelligence should not be allowed to receive copyrights. In addition, it should not be allowed to scan data that has a copyright. While I&#39;m not a huge fan of how copyrights are used (see: Disney), I do believe it can still protect smaller creators. Allowing artificial intelligence to access and learn from copyrighted materials is essentially saying plagiarism doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s not an actual person doing it. However, this still hurts people&#39;s livelihoods and makes the world a less interesting place.
