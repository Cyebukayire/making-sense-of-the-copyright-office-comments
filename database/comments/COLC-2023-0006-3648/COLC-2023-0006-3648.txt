I think that you should not be able to copyright materials made exclusively by generative AI. If AI produced Art, text, etc. is used in a larger work that has sufficient human involvement (beyond setting initial parameters or prompts for an AI model) that work could be copyrightable, in the same way that a collage might be (ideally with attribution to original works, including those used in the training data of the AI)
