AI is hugely capable of plagiarism and copyright violation, and artists and writers should be paid damages for the possible intellectual property theft that AI can impose. Any artist or writer whose work was scraped for use in an AI&#39;s training database is put at risk of this and therefore as many artists and writers as possible need to be compensated. AI at large is not in a state where it can predictably avoid infringing copyright.
