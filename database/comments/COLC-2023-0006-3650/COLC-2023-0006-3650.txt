I work as an artist in my spare time, and most of my work is released under a Creative Commons Attribution license. Compared to other artists who may submit comments, I have relatively little to lose in this area of debate.<br/><br/>With that being said, I believe AI generated works by and large should not receive copyright protection.<br/><br/>Copyright exists to protect human authorship and provide some sort of balance between the difficulty of creating works, and the ease of replicating them. Having effectively infinite generation based on the works of resource limited human authors means that AI generation fundamentally undermines what copyright is meant to protect.<br/><br/>That&#39;s not to say it doesn&#39;t have any place in an artist&#39;s toolkit; I think using it in limited amounts to remove redundant work that doesn&#39;t contribute much to the final output is very useful, and gets artists working more on the parts they care about. However, I think there has to be a balance, and that can be provided in the form of making artists legally liable for the output of AI generation.<br/><br/>AI generated works that are almost entirely AI generated have a risk of using or including recognizable copyrighted works from their dataset. However, artists that use it sparingly to fill in unimportant gaps are unlikely to run into this risk of copyright infringement. By making artists liable for any copyright infringement that an AI produces, it inherently incentivizes using it in small, measured ways that still maintain human artistry.<br/><br/>This also neatly solves other potential AI issues, such as using other humans&#39; likenesses in other works through AI. Any artist using an AI that wholesale copies another human&#39;s likeness is more likely to be noticeable or infringing in works with little human artistry added to the generation, but is less likely to be infringing if used in small, measured amounts that don&#39;t try to explicitly capitalize on other humans&#39; likenesses.<br/><br/>None of this solves the fundamental question of &quot;how much is too much?&quot;, but that question has always been difficult even before AI arrived. How much a music sample counts as copyright infringement is entirely a point of opinion based on how much another work&#39;s soul and recognizability is captured in that sample. One beat might be enough to be considered infringing, and yet another use might be so subtle in its impact that an author could include the entirety of another work and it wouldn&#39;t even be noticed. AI is similar in this regard, and should be judged with the same nuance.<br/><br/>Ultimately, AI really just takes existing copyright questions, and makes them harder to answer. However, we&#39;ve already had to deal with extensive nuance in fair use concerns, and having AI generated works muddle things further isn&#39;t really changing the fundamental questions of how we identify what a work is, who it belongs to, and what its impact on the market would be.
