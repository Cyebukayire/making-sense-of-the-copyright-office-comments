I have two separate acquaintances who are visual artists. Both have suffered having their art incorporated into the learning process of an computer learning algorithm, and then used to imitate their style. This is a clear exploitation of their creative work, against their consent, and also devalues their worth as well. It is harmful to creative works, and threatening smaller creatives who do not have the resources or know how to combat this exploitation. I only wish the best and a fair livelihood for my friends who wish to devote themselves to expand human culture and expression. It&#39;s a noble pursuit that needs legal protection just as much as other industries.
