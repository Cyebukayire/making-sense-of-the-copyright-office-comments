AI works should not be copyrighted. They are derivatives of others&#39; works, usually made without the consent of the original artists who never opted in to have their artwork put into the training data to begin with, and it actively steals from jobs where ever possible due to corporations being more than willing to cut costs where ever they can. AI works also do not contain a truly human element - you just type in prompts (often times artists&#39; names) and keep hitting &quot;create&quot; until you get something close enough to what you want. It&#39;s a grift that steals jobs and works from artists, voice actors, musicians, and more.
