I do not like not trust AI. I do not trust people who use AI, particularly for writing and art. It&rsquo;s taking work done by other people, slopping it together, and some guy who typed a few words calls it THEIRS. Same with writing. I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable putting any of my own content online because of it. Companies, especially studios, trying to incorporate AI as a way to cheapen their workforce (benefitting off the backs of the ACTUAL artist and writers who give their product life) is disgusting. Do not support whatsoever.
