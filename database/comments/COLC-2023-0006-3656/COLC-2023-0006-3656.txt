My opinion is that you shouldn&#39;t be able to copyright anything originally written by an AI, even if revised/edited by a human, unless the amount of revisions/edits by a human passes a certain large threshold... Regardless if that&#39;s viable or not, there needs to be steep disadvantages to creating with ai.
