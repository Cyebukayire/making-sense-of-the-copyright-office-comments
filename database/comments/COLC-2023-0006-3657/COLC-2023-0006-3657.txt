Do not allow AI to even get a toe hold on what is and shoukd only be the work oglf humans. Do not fall for the &quot;humans will be involved in the prompts&quot; and other crack-opening arguments. Once AI work is allowed to be seen in the same way as thT of human creators it will only be a shirt time before all human creativity is co-opted by corporations for cheap art.
