Artificial Intelligence, as it is right now, is nothing more than a way for corrupt, greedy corporations to avoid paying workers and artists while also stealing the work of those same workers and artists. They always want to save a buck, even when they can afford hundreds of billions of dollars in buyouts and deals, and they&#39;ll do anything to cut those dollars from the people who actually do the hard work of making that money. The artists, the writers, and the actors are all standing against this because their livelihoods and their families are in danger because of the greed of a small few people like Iger and Zaslav. Don&#39;t let them get away with this
