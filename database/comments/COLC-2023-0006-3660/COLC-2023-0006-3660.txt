It is my belief that generative AI should not be trained on media without the express consent of and compensation to the owners of said media. Artists, authors, and anyone who has honed their craft to the point that it would be used to train artificial intelligence have a right to decide whether or not the fruits of their years of labor are picked for that purpose. Having the product of those efforts taken without their permission and used to replace human artists with artificial algorithms cheaply may not be a legal crime, but it is ethical crime.
