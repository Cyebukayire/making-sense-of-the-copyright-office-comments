Generative AI technology is often illegally trained on copyrighted materials without the consent of the copyright holder. While it certainly could offer benefits to augment the work of human creators, works wholly generated via AI are merely algorithmic remixes of actual works. They will flood the marketplace, devalue human-created art forms, and jeopardize the livelihoods of artists. In turn, future generations of would-be artists and creators will be disincentivized to pursue the arts due to the signal to noise ratio caused by regurgitated content resulting from the under-regulated generative AI technologies.
