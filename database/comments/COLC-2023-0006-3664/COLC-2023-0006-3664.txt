The products of artificial intelligence should NOT be copyright protected. The system is trained on works of thousands of artists without their consents in order to reproduce the likeness of their works for little pay. This practice is predatory, and there are very few corporations that can claim to have trained their AIs on works of artists that have clearly given consent. Therefore, the use of AI is unethical and should not be allowed copyright protection.
