AI is fed information, adds nothing new, and whatever comes out has nothing added to it. It is not creative, it makes nothing new. There is nothing to copyright, since there is no creator behind the product. There is no intent, beyond the prompts that is given to the AI - no one chooses the specific colors or words that make up the product.
