As a software engineer who has created several small neural networks in the past, I feel that I may be qualified to speak on this issue. While I am not all that familiar with copyright law, it is my understanding that AI advocates are claiming that the processes used by text or image generating models is sufficiently transformative to avoid infringing on the copyright of the works used to train it. It is my firm belief that this is not the case. The weight matrices used in generative AI models arise directly from the source material used, processed through several layers of abstract mathematics. It is my my opinion that the human input to these matrices is so minimal as to be irrelevant. Pieces of media generated by AI trained on copyrighted media should not be able to be copyrighted themselves, and in my opinion should even be considered violations of the original copyrighted works.
