As both something of an artist and writer myself and one who is close friends with many who make a living off of their own art and writing, the recent upspring of AI technology has made things for very difficult. With a simple program, many pieces can be almost entirely plagiarized using someone else&#39;s work as a base. And once that program has the references it needs it can churn out more and more copies without the owner&#39;s consent. I believe AI use in the fields of art, writing and voice should be much more restrictive in order to preserve both copyright law as we know it, and to maintain respect for individuals who dedicate their life, time and effort to a craft a select few would rather  go against their wishes and emulate their craft for a worse copy.
