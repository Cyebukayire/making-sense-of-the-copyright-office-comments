I&#39;m a writer who posts online. I did not spend thousands of dollars on my bachelor&#39;s degree in creative writing to have an AI system use my writing without permission or compensation to learn how to be creative. These AI tools were unethically taught and do not own the ideas, phrases, voice, narratives, etc. that they stole.
