I believe artists and writers should give consent and receive compensation to be included in a training set, and images and writing resulting from AI should not be eligible for copyright without significant further human manipulation/improvement of the generated image. I think feeding existing works into an AI anything, and using what comes out as ones own works should be considered plagrism. These people are actively stealing from others and passing it off as their own work.
