AI shouldn&#39;t be utilized in a creative facet the way it currently is. People feed their AI with other people&#39;s work. Art AND voice talent is affected. I don&#39;t like the idea of someone being able to clone my voice to make it say whatever they want. That power shouldn&#39;t be in ANYONE&#39;S hands, let alone common citizens. To be able to take someone&#39;s art style or likeness, and produce imagery in whatever manner they seem is very invasive and manipulative. It takes away the very meaning of art, and is putting it into a &quot;manufactured&quot; form, stripping the artistic process of any meaning. Art is a means of human expression created BY humans, to echo the process of life. It&#39;s about the process, and AI strips that process away.
