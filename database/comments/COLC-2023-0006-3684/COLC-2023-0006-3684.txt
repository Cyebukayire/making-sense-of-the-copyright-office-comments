As someone who has used generative AI programs for over a year now, I urge the Copyright Office to do two things:<br/><br/>1) Continue the policy that works not created by a human are not copyrightable, expressly including works that are only generated by AI or are generated by AI and only superficially modified or changed by a human.  Works that are substantially modified by a human should be able to be copyrighted. <br/><br/>2) Make clear that the use by AI engines of text or images to train themselves to create their products does not constitute copyright infringement, just as it has long been the case that search engines can &quot;imbibe&quot; content on the web for the purpose of generating search results without violating copyright.  <br/><br/>I believe that chaos will result, and much future innovation will be lost, unless both of these become the standard in the United States.
