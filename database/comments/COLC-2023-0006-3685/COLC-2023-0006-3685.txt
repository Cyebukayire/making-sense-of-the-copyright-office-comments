AI generated images should not be able to be copyrighted. Without an element of human-led transformation, anyone using the same prompt would be able to generate the same or very similar images. If AI generated content was capable of being copyrighted without any further editing or changing, there&#39;s nothing stopping a bad actor from simply generating as much content as possible using these tools and using that to harass and antagonize other artists and users. I also feel that many companies want to use AI tools to avoid paying working artists of all kinds, and not allowing anyone to copyright ai generated images feels like a reasonable compromise.
