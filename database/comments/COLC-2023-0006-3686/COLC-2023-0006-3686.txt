AI generated works especially the arts -music, writing, images and moving images are created from existing works of art. They are amalgamations of others work that was used without permission. Sometimes with music they are literally stealing/copying/duplicating an artists voice to the point that it is almost indistinguishable from the artist. This must be a violation of copyright of the works of these artists and whatever is created from this should not in turn be copyright able. It is a software that is stealing and mimicking. We must protect art made by human beings. Art and it&rsquo;s expression is one of the things that is humanities greatest gift. Ai creations should not be copyrightable. And we must better protect the art that is being used to make these AI products.
