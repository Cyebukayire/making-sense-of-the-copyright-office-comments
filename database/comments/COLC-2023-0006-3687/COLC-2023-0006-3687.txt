AI has been taken to the most repulsive extreme. Instead of difficult parts of life being made easier, it is replacing real human people, leaving hard working American citizens out of a job because &ldquo;the computer can do it too&rdquo;. It has encouraged people to steal real art and turn around to try and sell it as their own. AI ignores copyright law and allows and even promotes this crime for it to function. To allow a tool to bypass laws, regulations and basic human rights to their own work and skills is distasteful at best and criminal at worst.
