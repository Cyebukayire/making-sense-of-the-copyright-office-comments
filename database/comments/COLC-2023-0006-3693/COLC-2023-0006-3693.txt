Artificial intelligence in the workplace is a very slippery slope. With the very idea of ever-expanding AI there is the threat of being replaced. There is no greater field at risk than artists. AI art is a very controversial topic within the artist space due to the speed of art generated, the use of existing art for training data, and the fact that some AI takes pieces of existing art from the internet for use in its generated pieces. There have even been examples of multiple signatures potentially being taken off an image by these AI generators and combined into an illegible scribble on the new generated image. These signatures are potential proof of the points above. Artists are not credited or compensated by these generators, and some individuals are choosing to use these generators instead of commissioning art. AI art, furthermore, devalues the actual work artists put in. As stated before, AI art generators are much faster and cheaper than human artists, albeit with varying results. AI art tends to get the general idea with minor errors in places like hands, which in some individuals&rsquo; eyes is good enough to simply use AI for their creative needs. This is obviously bad for business as artists cannot keep up with the speed of AI, nor how cheap it is. So when the AI generators are taking artist&rsquo;s art and their work, they deserve the right to disallow these generators from taking pieces for use in generated images and to be compensated for it. Regardless of what ultimately comes from this potential law, there is change that needs to be made.
