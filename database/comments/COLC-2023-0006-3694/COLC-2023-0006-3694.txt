I am writing to address the use of artificial intelligence and being able to copyright AI-generated material. AI material can only take existing works and regurgitate them, which means it&#39;s stealing often from previously copyrighted material. So by that logic, I strongly think AI-generated content should not be able to be copyrighted.
