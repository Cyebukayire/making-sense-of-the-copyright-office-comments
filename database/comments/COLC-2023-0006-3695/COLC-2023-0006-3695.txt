It&#39;s in the interest of maintaining the American spirit, of allowing the greatest contributions of humankind to shine, that we should prevent works derivative of actual human creative endeavors - such as drawing, vocal acting, and singing - from being swallowed up by artificial intelligence reproductions of such.<br/><br/>No capitalist should be allowed to sell products for art or entertainment - which are uniquely human activities - made from digital fakes, and claim that it was human-produced. A human entering prompts into a machine does not constitute enough creative addition to justify allowing sale of a product which was over 99% built on the labor of unwilling human artists, whose works were stolen to create the machine.<br/><br/>Any AI-produced work should be clearly designated as such and disallowed from earning the same level of copyright of a human-produced work.<br/>However it would make sense for some alternate version of copyrights to exist to properly identify AI-generated materials.
