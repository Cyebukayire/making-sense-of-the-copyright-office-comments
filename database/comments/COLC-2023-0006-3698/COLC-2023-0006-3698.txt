AI cannot content should not be able to be copyrighted. AIs are fed vast amounts of human based content in order to produce anything of value and those products are full of pieces from the original except they lack credit. Even if one determined the agreement for every single piece of content fed into the machine, copyright violation complaints would skyrocket. Lower class artists could be more easily strong armed into contracts where not only do they lack control over final products, but they are not even credited and companies could continue development of similar or a continuation of the same piece of media without the original authors/artists.
