Specifically in regards to copyright, AI I feel is completely, 100% incompatible. Please forgive the food analogy, but telling a computer a series of prompts to make something is like going to Subway and telling one of the workers there what you&#39;d like on your sandwich. You didn&#39;t actually make that sandwich, you just told someone how to do it. And, likewise, someone using AI to create something did not actually create that thing themselves, the AI did. An artificial intelligence program is not a human and, therefore, is unable to hold copyright on something. Even if an artist were to train an AI solely on their own work, I would argue images generated that way would also not fall under copyright.<br/><br/>In addition, some of these AI programs just lift art off the internet, without the consent of the artists. An AI frankensteining something together out of art it finds on the internet is nowhere near the same thing as a living, breathing human being inspired by something they see.<br/><br/>In regards to AI generation systems themselves, there absolutely, 100% needs to be transparency on exactly what these systems were trained on. Anyone arguing to the contrary, in my opinion, is trying to steal the work of others, and is akin to copyright infringement. I cannot fathom a reason for not being transparent on how an AI is trained, outside of &quot;If people know we&#39;re using their art to train our AI without their permission, they&#39;ll be mad.&quot;<br/><br/>There can certainly be arguments made for using AI in certain scenarios, such as generating an image and using it as a visual inspiration, or some such. However, an AI image itself cannot be held to copyright. Even if a human were to generate an image and then alter it a bit, I do not believe it would fall under copyright, just as me taking someone else&#39;s work and drawing over it wouldn&#39;t cause me to have copyright over it.
