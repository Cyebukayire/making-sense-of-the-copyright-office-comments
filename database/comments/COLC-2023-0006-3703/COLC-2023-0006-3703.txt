I beleieve AI in art, writing, voice making, etc needs to he regulated to some degree and should be infringable on sources from which the programs draw. Whetehr this means allowing for voices to be copy righted, specific policies in place on ai, etc. Something should be done to make a stark difference between ai, and legitimate creative work. Continuing to ignore it will have long standing consequences for job security in related fields.
