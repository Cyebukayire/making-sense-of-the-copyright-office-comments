Facebook announced they would be scrapping posts for AI use and treated anyone who objected like we&#39;re stupid fucking children who cannot POSSIBLY understand AI if we attempted to otp out. As it stands, no website is able to guarantee our hard work won&#39;t be stolen and used for AI learning software. Entire datasets are filled with copyrighted material, screenplay writers are on strike because studios are attempting to force them into a new editing role for AI, and studios have forced background workers to have their entire image scan to remain on a data set forever. The choice given: be scanned or not work at all that day. They demand limitless access to OUR work, to OUR labor to be garbled up and spat back out in a collage we don&#39;t recogonize. AI has evolved to the point where it threatens the work of translators, actors, novelists, cover artists, online content creators, and more.<br/><br/>How long will it be til our tech overlords decide that their precious stupid machine is better at law than a senator? Or you? How many more lives does AI have to ruin until we demand these people shut them down, delete their data sets, and destroy these machines? AI is attempting to ruin our lives, and we have the oppurtunity to save our future. History is watching. Don&#39;t let them down.
