AI is killing so many industries because it ignores copy right and still able to train AI without any issues. There are so many AI softwares and services which already infringed copyrights and pretend it&#39;s nothing. Some people say it&#39;s a new way to train which people already did a long time ago but that&#39;s totally wrong as AI can do anything and it&#39;s just a matter of time before AI replace many industries. If AI can not be regulated or controlled, only AI will survive. This is why we need strict laws toward AI. Even companies are start using AI in order to not paying models and photographers. This is something that we need to resolve as soon as possible before it&#39;s too late.
