Since AI/generative content is generated by a computer program/neural network, rather than by a human author, and copyright is intended to protect &quot;original works of authorship&quot;, I believe that AI/generative works should not be copyrightable. Otherwise, the copyright for the work would logically belong to the AI/generator itself, as the &quot;author&quot; of the work, not to any human or corporate entity. Since AI generators are trained on large sets of existing work, the authorship of any AI-generated work could also be said to be shared between every author of work in the AI training set, leaving only a small fractional percentage of authorship to the creators and users/prompter of AI programs. Unless it can be shown that the user/prompter of an AI program owns the copyright to the entire set of data used to train the generative AI, (e.g., an artist training an AI program exclusively on their own works; a company lawfully authorized to create derivative works of items held in copyright trains an AI to generate said derivative works), the AI-generated work should not be copyrightable. <br/>I am also concerned about AI generated human replicas/&quot;deepfakes&quot;/voice mimicking. I think every human person should possess copyright or similar protections over their own voice and likeness, subject to the same or similar term of copyright as other works (currently life of the author+70 years). This way, it would be permissible to create new audio/visual works containing high-fidelity facsimiles of the voice/likeness of historical figures, while also protecting living people&#39;s rights to the use of their own image. Unless a living person specifically authorizes AI-generated use of their likeness/voice for a specific purpose, that usage should be protected until the expiry of the copyright term, as if an individual is the author of the copyrightable work of themself.
