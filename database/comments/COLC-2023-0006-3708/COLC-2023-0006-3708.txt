As an author of many books, I am deeply disturbed by the idea that my work could be used to train A.I. without my consent. To say nothing of the unfairness or an A.I. company profiting off said training. It is violation of my right to my own ideas. As a consumer, I am worried about A.I. material that isn&#39;t labeled as such. I am horrified by the idea that I might read, watch, or listen to material and not know that it was created by artificial intelligence. I urge the copyright office to enact restrictions on the use of copyrighted material by A.I. companies to either train its algorithms or to create new content without the copyright holder&#39;s consent.
