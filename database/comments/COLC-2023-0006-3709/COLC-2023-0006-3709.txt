AI art is theft. It takes the work of real, human artists and regurgitates it without crediting them. It cannot create anything original, and the true artists will not be properly compensated. The same goes for ripping off voice actors or scanning extras to use in perpetuity. We should be working to protect actual humans, not corporations who don&#39;t want to pay residuals or commissions to artists. Stop letting corporations get away with theft. AI art should not be permitted to use the works of others without compensation. They should have to get permission to use the original works in their algorithm and should pay the original artist every time it is used to generate new content.
