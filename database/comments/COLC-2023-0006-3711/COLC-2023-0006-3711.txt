Corporations such as OpenAI straight-up scrape already copyrighted data to train their programs. Allowing this to continue means weakening the protections of people&#39;s intellectual property for the sake of one day giving said people&#39;s jobs to computer programs. There are plenty of ways AI can be developed and used without stealing other people&#39;s work, and I believe that if corporations like OpenAI and Stability AI are unwilling to pay those people for their creations, or even ask for permission first, then they should explore those other options.
