Some people may argue that AI is making new work and is copyrightable, however it has been stated that if a work is a &quot;purely mechanical task with no element of original selection coordination, or arrangement&quot; it can not be copyrighted. I believe that AI would fall into this category as what it generates is not made by a person with intent or purposeful selection.
