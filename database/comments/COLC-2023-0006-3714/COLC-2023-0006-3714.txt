If resampling in music requires due credit and compensation when used in other media, so too should AI generated works.  Utilizing copyrighted works as a sampling pool cannot be free use under current basic copyright law, as it does not fall under parody, nor does it meaningfully generate unique works, only collages of it&#39;s datasets.  Please begin regulation now, as this increase in AI generated works both stifles and steals from artists and exists as a threat to public health when it comes to producing articles, information, and books which contain false and confusing information.
