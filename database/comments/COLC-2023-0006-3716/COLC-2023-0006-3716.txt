Hello I&rsquo;m asking for AI to be regulated as the way it currently works, it is stealing the work of artists and writers I am friends with. There&rsquo;s a big push for lots of companies to use AI because it&rsquo;s cheaper and new, but it never got permission or paid back the people it used to build it&rsquo;s algorithms. I also think that any company using AI needs to be explicitly clear where they are getting their work from so we know if that ai data scraped people against their will. Currently AI is so loosely regulated, that it&rsquo;s causing real economic harm and problems for people I know. We need the economic law to keep up with the new technology to ensure its ethically used.
