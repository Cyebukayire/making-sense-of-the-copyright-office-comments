Much like all technological advances, the industry developing the tools will use every asset available to convince the governments of the world of their benefits. I don&#39;t believe they&#39;ll even both to try convincing the people of the world. Because the people don&#39;t have the power to regulate them. Only you do. And that&#39;s why they&#39;ll focus on convincing you. Because if you ask an artist, a writer, an academic or other people who make their livelihood from creating original works, they&#39;ll tell you, there is no benefit to this technology. It functions solely to scrape, regurgitate and dilute the work and perspective of humans. It plunders the global internet fields that we&#39;ve been planting our work in for decades, and turns it into a slurry, available to pump out at a cheap price, because no human effort is required from the tech -- the work has been done by others, who will remain uncompensated and unrecognized should this technology remain unregulated.
