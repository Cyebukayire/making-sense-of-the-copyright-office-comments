It has been stated that &quot;Only the owner of copyright in a work has the right to prepare, or to authorize someone else to create, a new version of that work. Accordingly, you cannot claim copyright to another&#39;s work, no matter how much you change it, unless you have the owner&#39;s consent.&quot;, so AI should not be trained with materials unless the owner of said materials consent.
