AI programs should not be allowed to be trained on copyrighted material. Far more often than not, copyrighted materials such as art and writing are taken from creators without compensation or even consent. They are usually not even notified of their work being used until they find an image using it or someone else points it out to them. Any work stitched together, whether it be literary, musical, or visual, from the works of dozens of different unknown people cannot be ascribed to a creator. Thus, giving it its own copyright makes no sense. This is especially true if there is no original input from whoever typed the prompt, which is often the case. This is especially clear with articles written by AI. These articles often blatantly spread false, made up information. This is clear evidence that they aren&#39;t even reviewed before publishing, much less have any sort of new, original input. Again, as there&#39;s no clear or original work, there&#39;s no reason to give AI generated work copyright. These practices are plagiarism. If a student copied and pasted multiple articles into one document, changed little to nothing, and called it an essay, they would be in a lot of trouble. Same with other creative mediums such as art as well. This is, at best, what AI does, yet it is somehow still debated whether or not AI works can be copyrighted. Plagiarism cannot and should not be copyrighted, which is why copyrighting AI generated works directly goes against the fundamentals of copyright law.
