I believe that works created through the use of Generative AI do not merit copyright protection. Copyright exists to enable writers and artists to obtain credit and compensation for their work, so that they can dedicate time to improving their skills and producing meaningful art. This does not apply to AI, which can quickly create text or images with minimal input from a person. Moreover, current generative AI systems have been trained on data taken -- usually without consent -- from millions of human creators. To allow AI generated art and text to be copyrighted, while not requiring AI to respect the copyright of the people who created the works used to train it, would be to legalize digital theft.
