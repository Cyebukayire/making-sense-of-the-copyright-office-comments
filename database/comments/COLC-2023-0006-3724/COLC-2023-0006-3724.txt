Generative AI or any other comparable AI is theft. Period. AI is only as good as the material it has access to. Specifically in regards to copyright, AI uses copywritten material to &quot;create&quot; something new. But it&#39;s NOT new. It is the product of thousands if not millions of copy written work. Unlike humans that are influenced by art, AI is not human. It&#39;s not influenced. It steals. I can&#39;t use someone&#39;s copy written work in my work without securing the rights to use it from the copy write owner. You pay for its use. AI doesn&#39;t pay it steals. Think NAPSTER, but on a much grander scale. If I steal 10,000 parts from 10,000 different cars and build 1 brand new car, it&#39;s not new. It&#39;s a stolen car. If AI goes unregulated, no artist is safe. AI will soon be able to produce an entire Taylor Swift album, without compensating Taylor Swift. Want a new Stephen King novel without paying Stephen King? Done. Congress HAS to take action. AI can be an extremely useful tool, but we cannot allow AI to circumvent copyright rules. Thank you.
