Hello, I am an employee at the IA prevention team and I study IA has well has teach about it&#39;s danger.<br/><br/>I am working in an public university in close relation with professor, giving lesson and conference so they don&#39;t get trick by student cheating.<br/><br/>This is possible to analyse and teach about IA art imitation and IA voice imitation. It isn&#39;t for text including chatGPT.<br/><br/>This august we detected 150 persons cheating with IA generated images (false profiles, art study etc) but we estimated that over 800 in total cheated with the help of chat GPT and others text software (250 were detected). All thoses student are or is going to be fired for the university, loosing their time and money. This is a call out for the youth, who don&#39;t know using those tools can have serious consequence.<br/><br/>Also, we already pledge for it, I will ask:<br/>Make all IA content copyright free and force website to have platform to archive them so we can prevent plagiat along our rank but probably your future ranks too.<br/><br/>The IA employee worker specialize in image analysis and Multimedia ingenior.<br/>L.L
