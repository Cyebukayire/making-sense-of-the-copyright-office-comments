As part of my masters degree in rhetoric and composition, I studied the writing process and how people write and edit their work. I taught college composition and we thoroughly discussed the importance of citing your work and academic integrity. Artificial intelligence non-consensually trained on the intellectual property of others is something that flies in the face of copyright and IP protections. This strips authors of their property and damages their ability to hone their practice and make a livlihood. Human creation is what makes art, be it writing, painting, acting or any other creative endeavor, so powerful. Current IP law includes fair use provisions that allow novel, different, remixed, and academic interpretation of others&#39; work that does not infringe upon the rights of the creator(s). AI writing the ends of stories (or even full stories) &quot;in the style of&quot; an author takes away from what authors can do in their career and can put their ideas in the public without their consent. The same goes for other artists or creators. Is AI useful sometimes? Of course, but training on datasets that aren&#39;t public domain or consented to by each creator is devaluing the labor of the people who create and cheapening the human experience of the world.
