I think the biggest problem is that people are trying to treat AI as an individual learning things and doing whatever you ask of it. So for me, the biggest issue being art (in quite honestly any capacity), and people using AI for art. The problem with using AI for art is that the AI essentially copies the work, and spits it out through a &quot;filter&quot; so that its &quot;original and different&quot;. People who are ok with AI art like to compare it to &quot;well, artists learn by copying the masters, this is no different&quot;. But it is. The first, and biggest thing, is that any artist learning and developing their skill - they&#39;re not passing off their developmental work as sole, original stuff. They come out and say &quot;hey, I&#39;ve been doing a study of this style, or this medium, or whatever - influenced by this artist&quot;. An artist has to be very careful with work that is inspired or derived, because anything that can be seen as &#39;copying&#39; can get them into trouble legally and socially. You dont just rip off someone elses work. Ethically and professionally, thats frowned upon. Because its stealing from the original artist. AI is treating it like the things AI produces is solely original when it&#39;s not. Secondly, the other half of it is people think that &quot;oh its just copying a picture, artists do that now.&quot; And artists now may copy a reference for practice, but again they don&#39;t pass it off as theirs, and they certainly don&#39;t try to monetize it, because actually, photographs can be copyrighted. Straight up copying a photograph is also technically illegal. Especially because most a lot of professional photographers copyright their work to prevent someone copying their pictures, but say in like colored pencil, and passing it off as their work. AI is like a kid in art class in middle school - consume and regurgitate what you see. It&#39;s &#39;young&#39;, its not developed to the point of being able to actually think for itself and make original work and think critically. AI is still just math right now, spitting out the most likely variable to solve your formula/equation. Do I think it&#39;s neat and helpful? Sure! Artists use reference material all the time - but that&#39;s all AI can feasibly do right now. Is reference. Anything AI creates right now is just going to be taking already made works, shoved into a blender, and then pieces are taken out to fit the parameters. (And certainly you can argue about the pieces, because musical artists sample other works all the time, but that&#39;s still a careful process, and one where there&#39;s a certain expectation of permission from the original artist. Because they&#39;re the original artist.)<br/><br/>It all boils down to permission. If an original artist says &quot;heck yeah, copy my work I don&#39;t care&quot; well then that&#39;s whatever. But AI just consumes whatevers already put out. It doesn&#39;t ask if it can &#39;sample&#39; the work. And if an artist very clearly said &quot;no, do not use or copy my work&quot; that&#39;s a very clear line that AI is going to ignore. Because it&#39;s not at the point of thinking yet. It&#39;s just really fancy and fast math. Math does not care about ethics. AI is a small child whose brain has not yet developed, and is just repeating everything the adults tell them. <br/>In conclusion, AI is theft. The AI doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s a theif, but the person setting the parameters and using whatever it spits out and selling it as their own stuff is the one perpetrating the theft. You would hold individuals accountable for intellectual theft, you would hold companies accountable for intellectual theft. AI is just a tool. And some individuals and companies use said tool to steal voices, likenesses, ideas, written works, art, and on and on.
