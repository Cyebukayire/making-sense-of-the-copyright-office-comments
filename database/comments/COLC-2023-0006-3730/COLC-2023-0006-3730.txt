AI as a support tool for artists who choose to use them in their creation pipeline is fine. Crowd removal from photos, video stabilization tools, and ray tracing are all tools that really shine when enhanced by AI. <br/><br/>The problem is when AI tools are scraping social media, to essentially steal art and styles created by an individual, in order to spit out copies of an art style that someone else spent time and effort replicating. This process absolutely infringes on the intellectual property of an individual in a way they can&#39;t even protect themselves from.

Stealing the creative content and private images of individuals who have no option other than these monolithic entities.
