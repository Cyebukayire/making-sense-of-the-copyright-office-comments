As someone that is currently working on writing my first novel, I am honestly worried that if someone were to get a hold of my unfinished story, that they could put it into an A.I. such as ChatGPT and ask it to finish it for them. Them doing so would allow them to then publish my intellectual property under their own name before I ever got the chance to even full form it myself, and thus make profit off of it. Other users of what A.I. they had used may then also be able to take parts of my intellectual property, if said A.I. had saved what was imputed and used it as a base for later responses, and use it for themselves. <br/>I have a similar worry over any intellectual property that artists would have over their own work. If someone with a very unique style were to get their art taken, feed into an A.I. that was being taught to replicate it, if that A.I. were to succeed in replicating that style, suddenly that artist&#39;s work would be made to have less value than it did before, and could even lead to whomever was using the A.I. that is now replicating their style, trying to take credit for the work that the artist had already made, and thus make profit off of their intellectual property.
