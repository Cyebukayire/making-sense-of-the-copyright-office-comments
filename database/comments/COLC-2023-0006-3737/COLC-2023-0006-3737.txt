I feel that AI generated works should have some measure of ability to be copyrighted,  particularly in instances where they are used in support of an original idea.<br/><br/>Examples include, but are not limited to: using AI generated images to supplement a portion of one&#39;s work (i.e. using AI to generate backgrounds for a piece one has drawn the characters in),  instances of multiple images being used to tell a story the publisher has created with the story being the original work, AI generated animations or instances of AI that generate the motion schematics to a design that has been inputted.<br/><br/>While I understand concerns about human artists being displaced by AI, there is no denying that it is a useful for those who lack the ability to draw it themselves and the means to hire a person, as well as AI animation potentially offering many benefits and opportunities for the independent animation industry as smaller teams could work faster and more cheaply by automating part of the process, allowing for more projects to be created.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the concerns that have been voiced in the past about AI infringing upon the copyright of those whose works were used to train the software in question are negligible as fair use laws permit portions of copyrighted works to be used as part of a new work as long as the portions used do not represent a significant portion of the original work, nor the best known part of it.
