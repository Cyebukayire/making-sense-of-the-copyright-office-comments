Why should AI creations be copy-righted any differently than human pieces? Creating with AI is the same as creating with any tool. If I use a pencil to make a piece of art or if I use Photoshop or if I use AI, ultimately, in all these cases, I am synthesizing data points in my mind or in the mind of the computer or a combination of the two to create my unique vision. How would one even tell if an AI or human created something? Whoever submits the AI creation should be the owner of the copyright. That being said... every creation is derivative. So the only thing that should be copyrighted is that specific iteration-creation, not future works derived from it. In the end, copyrights won&#39;t mean much because anyone will be able to have a slight-variation made of any creative work, for their unique purposes.
