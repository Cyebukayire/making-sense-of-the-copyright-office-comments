On behalf of myself as an individual, and many others in the art and media industry-- illustrators, animators, voice actors/actors, and writers-- thank you for asking the public for their perspective on this critical issue. <br/><br/>As a new college graduate just recently dipping their toes in artistic and media related career waters for the first time, the abrupt and unimpeded introduction of art and writing generating AI is extremely distressing, both from a position of job security, and a position of maintaining intellectual property. A year and a half ago, I had faith in being able to find work in my chosen career, even as we emerged from a pandemic that cost thousands of jobs; now, I can already see the impact of organizations trying to drive even the most experienced artists and authors out in favor of this unrestricted and, as it is currently being used, unethical technology. I say it is unethical due to the nature of how it works, and how it is being used. <br/><br/>Copyright protection is, in definition, a way to protect a creator from having their intellectual property stolen or misused in a set period of time, until it is released to the public domain. Currently, AI that generates art or writing, and the individuals that contribute to its code, have already stolen from copyrighted works in order to create the database used in its generated works. Artists of original works see no credit or financial compensation for the use of their creations, be it art, writing, or even their voice or face, in the case of an actor or other media-facing representative. The current operation of AI is not only a violation of copyright of artistic works, it is a violation of identity, and particularly in the case of AI that imitate voices and faces, it can be nefariously utilized to create works of impersonation nearly indistinguishable from the real person.<br/><br/>Therefore, I encourage the Copyright Office to adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI using copyrighted works without the permission of the creators or authors. Furthermore, though perhaps not in the jurisdiction of the Copyright Office, I encourage adopting the position that AI used to mimic a living or recently deceased person&#39;s voice or face should also see added restrictions in order to further protect those who work in film and media, as well as to prevent the spread of libel, defamation, misinformation, and conspiracy.<br/><br/>Thank you for accepting the feedback of the public on this critical matter.
