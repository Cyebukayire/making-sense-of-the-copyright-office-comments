Hello. My name is Kate, and I am a library science graduate student, one who recently took a course in copyright and intellectual property. I am also an artist and writer, though only as a hobby, and I have done a lot of personal research about various AI programs that have come into prominence over the past two years.<br/><br/>After spending several months studying the subject of copyright, I came to the conclusion that I am in generally favor of relaxing copyright restrictions whenever possible, and in favor of preventing the expansion of the duration of time that a work can legally remain under copyright. I am also a proponent of the open access movement, and I think that Fair Use should remain as broad and vague a concept as is possible to allow for the creation of more derivative works that can benefit society (because I think many, if not the majority, of derivative works do benefit society in some way). In short, I am in favor of more liberal laws concerning intellectual property.<br/><br/>However, the increasing prominence of AI programs in the creative fields concerns me greatly. Due to the speed with which AI can generate media (which is much, much faster than any human counterpart could manage), it has the potential to be extremely disruptive to a number of industries, and to potentially decimate the livelihoods of thousands, if not millions, of creators working in those industries as it improves.<br/><br/>I think it would be in the best interest of the general public for creative works that were generated using AI to not be considered eligible for copyright under the law, unless it can be shown and proven that all of the data and information used to train them was used with proper permissions from the original copyright holders (or sourced from the public domain).<br/><br/>I also personally think that any work generated using an AI that was trained off data that was used without the proper permissions should not be monetizable, though I understand that that is probably impossible to ask for. I am not sure exactly where these un-copyrightable works would stand legally. If they fall into the public domain, anybody could make money off of them if they wanted to by selling copies or reproductions of these works, and I don&rsquo;t think that is really the right answer to this problem either. I am not sure creating a third category that is neither &ldquo;the public domain&rdquo; nor &ldquo;under copyright&rdquo; makes much sense in this case either.<br/><br/>Regardless, I do think that legally preventing these works from being copyrightable would do a lot to deter the worst kinds of abuses of this technology. I urge you, as a creator and a lover of the arts in all forms, to carefully consider what you do in the future if and when you attempt to revise copyright law to account for this new technology.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
