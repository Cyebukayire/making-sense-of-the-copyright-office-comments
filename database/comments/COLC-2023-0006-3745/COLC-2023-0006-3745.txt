generative AI pulls from datasets that consist of personal property, trademarked material, and copyrighted material without consent, agreement, contract, or consultation of the party that the data belongs to. anything trained on these datasets are violating the rights of the copyright or trademark holders. this does not fall under fair use as it is the entirety of the image or media that is being used. not small pieces or crops of the original images or writing. people are using the hard work of others without their consent to make a profit and none of that is going back to the original authors or artists whose assets were stolen and put through a program to plagiarize their work. these &quot;generative AI&quot; programs are better labeled as &quot;plagiarism programs&quot;. the program recognizes patterns but does not understand what the patterns are. this has lead to many instances of images &quot;generated&quot; by AI that look nearly identical to original assets that were plagiarized. these images have been overlayed with the originals and have found over a 90% match.<br/><br/>this is just the aspect of how it affects smaller artists and bigger corporations. not even mentioning the AI &quot;generated&quot; image of the pentagon being blown up, resulting in people panicking and pulling investments out of it. I do not currently remember the details on that, but it was a massive issue. AI does not just affect artists and writers. it can be used to create mass panic through deepfakes. this can affect presidential elections, falsify information, spread mass panic, and worse. people could not tell that the image generated by AI of the pentagon was fake. AI can now replicate voices with flawless accuracy. this can lead to fake presentations and speeches being made by politicians, federal agents, supreme court members, world leaders across the globe, and worse. if the public cannot tell the difference between truth and lie, then this will break every system that has barely held humanity together from the beginning.<br/><br/>humans are foolish creatures. easily lead on by their ignorance. and with the rise of AI, it puts people on edge, unsure of what to believe. it does not just affect the livelihoods of artists, writers, photographers, and the like. it affects children.<br/><br/>AI has also been used to generate pornographic material. not just of adults, but of children as well. as mentioned before, AI is trained on datasets. images and writing. pornographic material of children have already been generated by AI and it is still being used by pedophiles and human traffickers. these are real people and real children being defiled by people using AI to create such images of them.<br/><br/>AI is dangerous and should be shut down or at the bare minimum, all assets that are used within AI should be reviewed by the developers of the AI in conjunction with the creators of the datasets. a contract should be signed stating that any profits made off of those datasets will be shared with the creators of the datasets. laws should be put in place to prevent large corporations from abusing this power and laying off artists and writers, replacing them with these plagiarism programs. AI should never automate creative processes. it should also never be used to falsify information about real people or locations.<br/><br/>the amount of fields that AI affects is difficult to sum up in 5000 characters. and I do not currently have all of the documents downloaded to attach to my comment. many others have likely already attached the files I am mentioning. please consider how this affects humanity as a whole. not just figureheads and big-money corporations. there are people who need jobs that AI is threatening to replace and has already replaced. the hollywood strike is because people are threatened. and the response they got was to cut off the tops of trees so that protestors would have to die in the blistering heat. their response was &quot;we&#39;re going to wait until they are starving and can&#39;t pay rent. they&#39;ll come back.&quot; what kind of monster do you have to be to wish that on another human being? people like that should be behind bars and their assets seized and distributed to those it affected.
