AI in itself is an ethical issue regarding the technological theft of human work in order to make profit off of mainly people who did not consent to their works being used in such a way. I believe AI anything cannot be copyrighted as it is and was never original. If it was able to be copyrighted it would be a serious problem as the line between who owns what and who can get away with way is blurred and thieves would get away with some pretty shady things.
