Using someone else&#39;s work without there permission is theft. So training AI to use someone else&#39;s artwork without permission is theft and to a point where once they do it it can never be undone and causes permanent harm to the creator. If I cannot copyright the works of another for myself then AI shouldn&#39;t be able to either. There is no transparency or easy recourse of your work is stolen or your likeness used in ways you didn&#39;t approve. No copyright protections for AI.
