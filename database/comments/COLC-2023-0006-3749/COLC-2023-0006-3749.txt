I&#39;m not an artist or an AI user or &quot;tech bro&quot; so maybe my opinion here isn&#39;t as valuable as those who have a larger stake in the issue but it seems to me that while AI&#39;s code may be copyrighted the work produced by them shouldn&#39;t be. The use of an AI to create art in any capacity (music, pictures, movie scripts etc.) amounts to little more than a result from a calculator. No one would attempt to copyright the answer to Pi divided by three because no one owns the digits Pi or three. Similarly those who use AI&#39;s to generate a movie script don&#39;t own the scripts inputted (usually) but even if they did, using a machine to produce a work isn&#39;t the same as producing it in your own. It reduces art to a formula and removes the intellectual aspect from intellectual property since there was no real human ingenuity or even work put into the process. I am of the firm opinion that works made by AI can&#39;t be considered intellectual property and therefore shouldn&#39;t be protected by law. (unless of course you can have and prove that an AI is sentient which isn&#39;t the case, at least not yet)
