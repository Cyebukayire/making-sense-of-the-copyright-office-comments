I would like to say that ai needs to be regulated, many people have their work stolen without consent to be fed to ai programs, if it&rsquo;s possible to make sure ai works can&rsquo;t be copyrighted then it would be possible to allow people whose work is stolen feel safer and not be stolen from, thank you for listening.
