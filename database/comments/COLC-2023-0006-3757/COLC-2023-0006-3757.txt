What AI is currently doing should be illegal. People&rsquo;s work, whether they be art, writing, or even their voice, has been effectively stolen from them. This is destroying people&rsquo;s livelihoods. Before AI became as sophisticated as it is now, no one had to worry about posting their work online because they knew that even if it wasn&rsquo;t always fairly attributed to them, it could be starved back to the original creator. Now, they have to worry that their work is being taken and fed into an AI, which will then use it to create something &ldquo;new.&rdquo; And when they speak up about it, they get shamed and then get accused for using AI themselves. They&rsquo;re called frauds. This is not the same as an artist gaining inspiration from Da Vinci, Van Gogh, Monet, or any number of other artists. It&rsquo;s like someone took all of Van Gogh&rsquo;s work, analyzed it, copied many different elements of it and said &ldquo;this is not Starry Night. And even if it WAS, how do you know Van Gogh didn&rsquo;t just do the same thing? I bet he never actually painted a single painting in his life. And this piece of work should be valued at the exact same as any of these supposed &lsquo;Van Gogh pieces&rsquo;&rdquo;. It would be like if Weird Al tried to say that any of his parodies were actually originals. While it is technically &ldquo;new&rdquo;, we all still recognize that he is borrowing from other artists. That is what AI work is. Parodies. Only, they&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re originals and the ones who are suffering for it are those who truly put in the work that is now being stolen from them. People&rsquo;s lives are at stake here. Sometimes literally. Sometimes people&rsquo;s art is what&rsquo;s keeping food on their plates. Sometimes actors are losing healthcare because big corporations want to use their AI likelihoods and aren&rsquo;t willing to compensate or protect their actors. Sometimes they&rsquo;d rather lose art by using AI writing just so they don&rsquo;t have to pay script writers a living wage. Have empathy. And if you can&rsquo;t have that, then have sympathy. Don&rsquo;t let greed take away true art. I&rsquo;m not saying AI needs to be stopped, just that it needs to be regulated. Artists need to feel secure in posting their work and not having it be taken and used against their will.
