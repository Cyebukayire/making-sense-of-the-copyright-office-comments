The three main problems I see with AI are: 1. They are created with databases of stolen information. 2. Their intended use eliminates jobs, particularly entry-level, in a myriad of fields from architecture to film to paralegals. 3. They can and have produced incorrect/falsified information; e.g. nonexistent legal cases, lists of &quot;safe&quot; foods that include toxins and allergens.  AI are getting more &#39;skilled&#39; as their stolen data increases and their algorithms become more refined, but that&#39;s just going to make AI-generated work more difficult to catch.  It&#39;s already provided false records of legal precedent in a court case in New York (iirc).  What happens when someone misses the next false precedent?  What about false data in medical science?  And in art and design, if a blueprint is used for a building or bridge that isn&#39;t structurally sound?  If an offensive or outright illegal piece of art or musical lyrics are attributed to a real, living artist, or even to the estate of a deceased one, what happens to their reputation and career?  And these are just the accidents.  What&#39;s keeping a company like Disney from &quot;discovering&quot; a work that extends their copyright holdings for decades more?  The current Writer&#39;s Guild strike, one of the articles in the studios&#39; contract demands was use of AI-generated CGI models of actors in perpetuity without compensation.  You can look it up.  AI is ALREADY being used for active malice, and given the information above about theft and falsification is freely available all over the internet, AI cannot at this time be used in good faith.
