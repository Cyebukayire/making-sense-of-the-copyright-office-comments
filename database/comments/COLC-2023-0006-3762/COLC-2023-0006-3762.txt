I am an indie creator. I&#39;m already seeing my fellow creators suffer from the spread of AI generated art. People are using AI to copy the style of other creators and they sometimes pretend to be that creator when posting or selling AI creations for profit. Even when creators aren&#39;t combating imposters and copyright violations, we have to prove to people that our original work is not AI generated. The unregulated use of AI is endangering the jobs of small creators. In some cases, it&#39;s even putting the public in harm&#39;s way. As an example: there are AI generated books on plant foraging that contain false information, which can lead to people consuming poison. It is my opinion that, while using AI to generate things isn&#39;t inherently a problem, regulations need to be in place to prevent the direct copying of individual artist&#39;s styles, and informational pieces generated by AI need to be clearly marked as AI generated, so consumers are aware that the information may be unreliable.
