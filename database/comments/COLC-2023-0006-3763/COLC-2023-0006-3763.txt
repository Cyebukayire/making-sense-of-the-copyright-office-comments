While AI as it exists currently is not a true intelligence, merely a system repeating patterns seen before in a data set, it still has potential to create simulated art that can fool most laypeople into thinking it was created by a human. AI has some useful applications, such as in natural language processing and translation, but it should not be used to deprive human artists of their livelihood. Private companies like Adobe have even created AI art features in their software, drawing from artists work which was not financially compensated, with the artists never set up to receive royalties on their art being used to train an AI model.
