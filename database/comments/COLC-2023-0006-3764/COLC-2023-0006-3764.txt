AI Content is not art. It is theft. AI relies on learning from content it is given, often times from artists that did not know their art would be a source/ did not want their art to be a source for AI content. AI doesn&#39;t create wholly new content; it takes the content it is given, and tries it&#39;s best to repicate it (IE, it takes the content of artists and replicates it). <br/>When a person tries to &quot;make&quot; art, by taking another artist&#39;s piece and selling it as their own, it is recognized that they did not make that art. They stole their art and tried to profit from it. And, if someone takes another person&#39;s art and traces it to make a &quot;new&quot; piece, it is recognized that it is not truly a new piece of art, but a replication of the former piece of art. What then is different about using AI to create &quot;new&quot; pieces of art, using training from other artists art, to replicate their style? AI does not and cannot create unique pieces of art like a Human can, and instead takes the work of real artists and tries to recreate it. It is simply a new way to try and steal the work of a real artist, and get the profits for themselves. The only differences is the &quot;Curator&quot; of the AI content does not even trace the other artists art, they just use AI to do it for them.<br/>Furthermore, many artists do not consent to their art being used to train these AI models. They either do not know that their art is being used to train AI models, or it is done without their consent. Artists, who spend many years trying to hone their craft, can suddenly find themselves seeing AI replications of their art, and lose potential revenue from commissioners or viewers of their content (Why pay the artist when the AI can just recreate the art for them?)<br/>AI content should not be allowed. It takes people&#39;s voices, artistic liberty, or other avenues for an artist to express themselves, and creates a soulless imitation of it. It is not art, it is theft. It should legally be treated as such.
