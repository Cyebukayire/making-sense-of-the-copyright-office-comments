Hello, <br/><br/>I&rsquo;m a Musician, composer &amp; instrumentalist, as well as a degree holder in Professional Music from Berklee College of Music, and a research analyst who is primarily interested in working to improve the balance between human creativity and technological advancement. I also own and am developing the YouTube Channel &ldquo;@AIGuitarist.&rdquo; I use AI in my music all the time, but in strictly limited capacity as I&rsquo;m primarily concerned with artistic integrity. This should prove my ability to speak on the subject.<br/><br/>A lot of us musicians are frightened by the implications of AI in our industry. The ones who aren&rsquo;t frightened already make a comfortable living, unaware of the cliff they&rsquo;re teetering on. The way we resolve this is by implementing a UBI structure for unionized artists who can prove they&rsquo;re working and not violating copyright. That said, the narrative seems focused on what AI shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to do, and that&rsquo;s the wrong question. We should ask what the appropriate uses of AI are, in order to quote-unquote, keep a lid on it. <br/><br/>When I apply my own professional ethics  to this debate, I come up with three places that AI would be appropriate: Sound Engineering, Marketing, and Payroll. AI may be used to write, record, arrange, reharmonize, and edit new music, but in accordance with recent law, it cannot be copyrighted.  The monetary value of all technology-assisted derivative works should (a)default to (b) be divided equally among the union which supports the artists, and not the software company or app developers. An independent artist should be able to release their own works on their own dime, just as some book publishers allow, and it changes nothing whether they&rsquo;ve used an app to master their song, then used an app to share it around social media, then used another app to finance a run of merchandise. Technically, the artist shouldn&rsquo;t be an artist and an engineer, and a PR director, and an accounts manager when their job is to make music. If each of those roles in the industry is enhanced by AI to ensure fair pay and innovation, GOOD. If it means that a lot of less-than-stellar artists and admin get other jobs to make way for a new class of clientele, GREAT. <br/><br/>We have to encourage a foundation of understanding in how to use AI properly among the general music making base, and encourage competition between artists from a baseline level of financial security. To quote a recent interview, to make a living, &ldquo;You have to be Drake.&rdquo; Well, that&rsquo;s neither possible nor desirable. The market is oversaturated but the yield is bountiful and the problem is hoarders. <br/><br/>In summary, it&rsquo;s not the AI, it&rsquo;s not the music, it&rsquo;s the infrastructure. And people shouldn&rsquo;t earn a living by stealing, but we can all benefit from working smarter rather than harder. People are scared because they feel alone, let&rsquo;s remind each other that we&rsquo;re not. It sounds hippy-dippy and oversimplified but establishing community is the best way to slay every wealth hoarding dragon I&rsquo;ve ever heard of. <br/><br/>TLDR: Offer me a job. I care.
