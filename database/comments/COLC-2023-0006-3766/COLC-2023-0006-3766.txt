AI isn&#39;t a person, therefore has no rights, and this extends to copyrights. Everything it &quot;creates&quot; is just a copy, scraped from the internet, and with a couple tweaks. Nothing original. If anything, it violates copyright laws, especially so because the original creators aren&#39;t being credited. The company that owns the AI tech is violating copyright law, stealing from others, never asking permission, never crediting. AI is dangerous, publishing books and using the names of real people to appear valid, or fake names and false credentials. Foraging books, for example, are supposed to provide info about sade things to eat that you can forage. The AI versions have info that, if you believe it to be true due to the &quot;credentials,&quot; will result in death. AI being used to &quot;write&quot; stories and scripts is scraping the internet for examples and copying or mashing copies together in a poor copy paste method isn&#39;t creating anything original. AI must be stopped. What it creates should not protected by copyright because it&#39;s just copying and stealing others.
