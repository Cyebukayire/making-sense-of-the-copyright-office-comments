What I think of AI as an individual is? That it&rsquo;s a threat to our existence as a species. Artificial intelligence has no soul when it comes to making products or entertainment, like saying I don&rsquo;t relate to this, because it doesn&rsquo;t have a story or I as an Individual can&rsquo;t resonate with a computer who only reads an algorithm. I see Artificial intelligence as uncreative and soulless, it steals what it is feed to the algorithm, and it spit out by soulless hacks. If it&rsquo;s not regulated it could have damaging effects to our society or our democracy. There is some good but we need to look at what the bad is, like I mentioned about how it strips of our humanity, AI doesn&rsquo;t know what life is, it&rsquo;s contained in a box, shackled from  the outside world, it only sees what&rsquo;s on the web or feed through its algorithm. There&rsquo;s nothing positive about how AI in the creative field and I think it should stay the hell away from any Creative Field period. Also in a closing note, Artificial Intelligence should be regulated so all you congress members new and especially you boomers who still sit in office; look into it and regulate it, Please and Thank you.
