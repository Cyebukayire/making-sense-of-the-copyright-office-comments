Artificial Intelligence is not original work and it is not created by a human. It is sampling others art or writing without the original creators permission. As an artist knowing that my art was used with out my permission is hurtful in more ways then just financial. The only ease I have gotten during this is the fact that they could not copyright it and that the U.S. Copyright Office was standing firm on that.
