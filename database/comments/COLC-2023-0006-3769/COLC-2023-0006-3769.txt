AI is plagiarism of people, artists, voices, and hard work done by human beings. To attempt to replace art, voices, people, actors with AI is disgusting and unethical. It is nothing but copying and stealing. It is taking food and work out of artists and actors months to feed machines. Please do NOT let companies profit off of stealing from others.
