AI companies should not be able to use copyrighted materials to build out their data sets without the permission of the copyright holders. Additionally, social platforms and content distributors should not be able to provide this permission on behalf of their users, without the users actively choosing to opt in. Anything less is theft, and theft that especially harms artists, writers, and other creatives whose work is being taken without their permission and then used to train tools that AI companies intend to replace them. While AI can be a powerful and useful tool, the way it is being developed is deeply unethical, and potentially illegal depending on how courts rule on copyright. Regulations should be put in place so internet users have the right to stop AI companies from scraping their words off of websites. If our words are so valuable to the creation of these technologies we should be compensated, and if these technologies can&rsquo;t exist without fair compensation and the permission of those whose word or works are being used, then they shouldn&rsquo;t exist until the AI developers have figured out a more ethical way of moving forward.
