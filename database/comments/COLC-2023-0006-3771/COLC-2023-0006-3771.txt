I believe that works created by artificial intelligence should not be able to copyrighted. They don&rsquo;t provide enough human involvement even if a human goes to touch up the work after it has been generated. In its current form it only steals from artists and writers who never gave consent to their work being used to generate the works. Overall I consider it a net negative for all creative works and copyright as a whole.
