At its core, this discussion is about if we can or cannot copyright AI-generated things. I could give you a million reasons why AI scraping is bad and I would guess others will. I&#39;ll spare you, you&#39;ve heard it, I&#39;m sure. We wouldn&#39;t be here if you hadn&#39;t. So we boil this down to only the argument of can AI works be copyrighted. No, they should not be, and here&#39;s why. These AI generated works are conglomerations of other people&#39;s work. Previously copyrighted items, free items that someone put hours of work into, photographs someone set all the proper settings and learned how to do composition in order to take, thoughts and ideas that a human personally took time and effort to create. Much the same way we&#39;d fail a student who lifted half their paper from a random online source, changed up a couple words, and turned it in, we should equally &quot;fail&quot; any copyright attempts from an AI source. The same thing is happening here. Someone has entered prompts into a program and that program is lifting information from other sources to spit out a result. There is evidence that one can go so far as to say &quot;make an image that looks like X person&#39;s art and has prompts A, B, C&quot; and it will do that by looking at all of that person&#39;s art, lifting pieces, and providing the output. It&#39;s pulled people&#39;s own hard work into question, yielded attacks on the real artist because someone else started posting similar works made by AI claiming them as their own. The same with writing. Entire concepts have been sucked into the AI due to the way it scraped data, which provides proof it was doing so. When someone now says make a book with these prompts, in some cases it&#39;s providing whole chunks of copyrighted text as the result. Hundreds of voices, thousands of hours of work, all lifted and provided as an output of the AI. When someone tries to claim a copyright on that, what they&#39;re really doing is trying to say the previous rights people had on their own work do not matter. We&#39;d accuse a child of plagiarism, fail them, tell their parents on them... but we&#39;re going to let adults get away with it and copyright it? Perhaps AI should come with quotations and citations when it makes a thing. This sentence in quotes came from this source, citation at end. This portion of the image came from here, citation embedded in metadata and written across the bottom of the image. <br/>The reality is, these sentences, image pieces, etc do not belong to the person typing in a prompt. They don&#39;t even belong to the AI or the company running the AI. They belong to the original creators. We cannot and should not copyright someone else&#39;s work, nor should we try.
