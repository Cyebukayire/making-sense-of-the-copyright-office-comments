I do not condone &ldquo;AI&rdquo; or rather these open script sources people create, but I do think it&rsquo;s unfair to allow someone to put in prompts and spew out works that have no real sense of personal direction and then allow that person to claim its their creation. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s an amalgamation of hundreds of thousands of other works and lack the individual perspective that gives something Intellectual property to call dibs on. So, I don&rsquo;t condone the use of AI, but I also believe anything you try to get copyrighted that was made by AI is not copyright-able by the sheer fact that their is no actual intellectual purpose driving its creation.
