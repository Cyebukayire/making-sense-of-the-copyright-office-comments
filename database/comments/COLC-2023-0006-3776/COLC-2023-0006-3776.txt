Some day, there might be a computer program which can be as creative as a human mind. That day has not arrived&mdash;not close. Modern generative AIs are basically a sophisticated method of making collages, of copying patterns from their data set to reproduce something similar.<br/>Beyond a technical level, they are primarily being used to avoid paying human artists. This is most obvious when you look at image-generating programs which are commanded to mimic a specific artist&#39;s style, but it&#39;s true of all generative AIs to one degree or another.<br/>Allowing generative AI to be freely used in place of human artists will give monolithic media megacorporations even more power over artists. They will have fewer humans who they have to share their profits with and more bargaining power to leverage against them. Even if AI-generated scripts, images, etc were equal in quality to what a human professional could produce, and they are *not*, giving so much power to corporate executives is a dangerous precedent to make. And also bad for the specific American workers affected.
