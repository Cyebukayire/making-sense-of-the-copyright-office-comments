Artificial intelligence is not feasibly able to be run without breaking copyright; it trains on such a vast array of information that it would be impossible to clear it all. This is not a valid excuse to avoid doing so; if anything, it shows that artificial intelligence/language models are not yet capable of being used in this capacity, if ever. An AI is incapable of recognising its own biases, is incapable of generating original ideas (and often incapable of discerning from where its ideas have originated). In this sense, the reliance on AI for the generation of creative content - aside from being a complete oxymoron - is likely to lead to a period of cultural stagnation, diminishing the very creativity and originality that copyright is supposed to uphold.
