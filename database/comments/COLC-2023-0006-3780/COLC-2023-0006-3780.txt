As a programmer with many artist friends, I&#39;ve been torn on this issue over the past year, but I&#39;ve come to some conclusions. I do not believe artists should have their work used to train machine learning systems without permission. This applies even if the system itself is not commercial, as it can be used to generate commercial work without adequate means for proof or credit. However, I still think AI systems can be used to create meaningful work, in whole or in part<br/><br/>I believe that any system that is either released publicly or used to create a commercial product should only be trained on works that the owner would have the right to use in a commercial product. Furthermore, It may be pertinent to require records of the used works that can be used to prove copyright in a court of law. As for users of these systems, they should probably be required to credit the system for any works they create with it, in whole or part. While this is not required for most artistic or productive tools, the copyrighted works used may create an exception
