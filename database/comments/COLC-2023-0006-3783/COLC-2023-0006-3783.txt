As an artist myself, I firmly believe that only things created by human hands can be copyrighted. These machine learning &quot;AI&quot; programs have no creativity, and only steal the works of others to feed through an algorithm and regurgitate garbage. The use of &quot;AI&quot; in creative fields will lead to corporations refusing to give actual artists and writers work in favor of a cheaper option, so these things must not be allowed to be copyrighted in order to preserve the arts. &quot;AI&quot; is an existential threat to creatives everywhere, and must not be allowed to thrive. It&#39;s an evil that must be smothered in its crib.
