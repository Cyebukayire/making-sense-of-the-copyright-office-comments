Generative AI represents one of the biggest threats to copyright law in US history. Creators absolutely deserve to have their work protected from being used as training fodder for large language models without their consent (this includes content publicly posted on social media. That content must be owned by the author, NOT the site they post to! Websites such as Reddit and Facebook should not be able to sell their users content, period, and giving up content rights should not be a term of use for social media sites). <br/>The developers of these large language models must pay to license any content used to train these models, and should continue to pay as long as the content is part of the model&rsquo;s dataset. <br/>Additionally, publishers must be required to note whether something is written by a human being or by a computer. We must not allow AI to replace human creation! When used appropriately, AI can be a tool to improve human effort, but only when used wisely, something that both companies and individuals have already demonstrated they are incapable of doing on their own. Publishers, businesses, and individuals should be required to clearly disclose when AI is used as part of creating a work. Furthermore, works created using AI, even in part, must immediately become part of the public domain. That is the only way to ensure that human creativity retains its value in the marketplace.
