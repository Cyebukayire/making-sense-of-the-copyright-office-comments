I am deeply concerned about the implications of AI use especially in art, film etc. currently, AI takes works from real people and amalgamated them without the artists consent or often even knowledge. It is completely unethical and makes creative careers even more difficult for real human beings. AI needs to be regulated strictly, and soon. Art theft like this cannot continue
