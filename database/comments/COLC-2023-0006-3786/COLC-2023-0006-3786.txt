From both the logical and interpersonal perspectives, any sort of AI work should not be able to be copyrighted at all. <br/><br/>From the logical perspective, it has been shown through various articles and conversion threads, AI steals from other people&#39;s artistic, intellectual works, regardless of the medium. It has even gone so far to take someone&#39;s likeness. For example there have been conversations with voice actors about having their voices stolen for AI promts. If this sort of theft is applied to multiple creators, especially if they are a major creator, it will cause a nightmarish level of infringement that would be for the lack of a better term, (pardon my language) absolute hell to navigate which becomes even worse if the number of creators the AI steals from increases. Not to mention there is currently a prominent strike going on with writers and actors over studio execs overbearingly attempting to, for the lack of a better term, replace these individuals with AI because it better line their own pockets.  <br/><br/>From a interpersonal perspective, the creation of art of all its forms has always been a human endeavor, that is fueled by both the experience of being alive and the human spirit which I define as the persevering connection we all have to each other regardless of out different backgrounds. Encapsulting the both of these comes with a certian level of reflection, fragility and vulnerability that cannot be trully described. An AI may be able to learn what it is to be human but without the aforementioned experience and spirit, it will never truly be human. As such it will never do justice to encapsulating those experiences. Sure it will look pretty but it will always be soulless. And in a world that feels like it&#39;s losing its soul and its ability to embrace its humanity, the last thing we need is to provide the means that could kill it for good.
