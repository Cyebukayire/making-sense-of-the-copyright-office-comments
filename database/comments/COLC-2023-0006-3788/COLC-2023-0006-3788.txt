The act of creation has always been a human urge. To express oneself and their love for their craft. These things are copyrighted for reasons of human creation and for the want to keep something under ownership protection. Make it so that other people can&#39;t have it because it&#39;s YOURS and it&#39;s not something someone else can use without your express permission. So when a new technology comes around to take those things, it should be illigal.<br/><br/>For artworks specifically, if you have some kind of protection over your art, people should not be aloud to save all your work and put it into an AI that copies you. Art is a starving market already, and with the creation of AI that can copy specific art styles, why would people commission someone when an AI can make it for free? It&#39;s horrible. It&#39;s terrible.<br/>At the very least, there should be some kind of requirement for permission to be had before putting people&#39;s art into something that actively uses it, just like how people are required to pay to get images put on shirts, blankets, frames, mugs, etc..., permission from the creator should be given before their things are taken and used for someone elses gain.<br/><br/>People are going to lose their jobs if this develops farther without regulation. They&#39;ve already made AI voices that copy those they listen to, with scarily accurate voices in most instances. AI like that, and I&#39;ve seen it, have been made to sing songs, talk about things the OWNER of that voice would NEVER say.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve seen AI take images of people and make them nude. There is NO valid reason for these things. It&#39;s inappropriate and wrong. It&#39;s extremely unethical and such an extreme breach of privacy.<br/><br/>People should have copyright ownership of their bodies. Their voices. Their own unique talents. Taking those things with the goal of it, &quot;Just being easier.&quot; And &quot;It&#39;s free so we don&#39;t need to pay real people&quot; is horrifying.<br/><br/>Thank you for the time you&#39;ve taken to reach out to the people as a whole. This is something that will change many lives, for the better or the worse, and puttting some kind of regulation on it is the best thing for humanity as a whole.<br/>This is the first time I&#39;ve ever reached out in the way, but I&#39;m desperate for anyone up there to hear our plea and understand why it&#39;s so terrifying for so many people.
