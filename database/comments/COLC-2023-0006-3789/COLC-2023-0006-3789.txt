When AI is used to get around someone not wanting to pay an actual creator to do their job, that is morally wrong; when that AI is trained on that person&#39;s (and/or other nonconsenting persons&#39;) work, in order to generate content that the person in question &quot;could have&quot; created, that is a violation.
