AI has nearly destroyed my art career and has destroyed the chances of a promising future as a children&#39;s book author and illustrator. Our children are going to grow up consuming soulless media made from an overreaching algorithm created by biased humans--statistically mostly white men. This is wrong. We all know this is wrong. We are not ready for this technology; there are so many people worldwide who are not even slightly media literate, how are they supposed to know what&#39;s real and what&#39;s fake? AI is being used to steal art, deep fake, plagiarize, etc etc etc ad nauseum. How do you live your life after someone with access to AI software creates fake pornography with your face on it? How do you stop mass dis- and misinformation when an AI can edit thousands of Wikipedia pages in a few seconds? How about when fake posting and deep faking causes societal upheaval? These aren&#39;t possibilities, these things are happening now! This is wrong. If tech giants didn&#39;t know it was wrong then there wouldn&#39;t be code of ethics bylaws in companies like Google stating that no employee is permitted to even attempt to create a sentient AI. That sounds absurd, but it&#39;s not. We&#39;re not talking about creating a soul here, that is entirely a fundamental misunderstanding, we&#39;re talking about &quot;sentient&quot; meaning it can fake us, imitate us, trick us. &quot;It&quot; being the algorithm that a biased person had developed. All the bias testing in the world is not enough to prevent it.<br/><br/>&quot;You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you&rsquo;re selling it, you wanna sell it. Well&hellip;your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn&rsquo;t stop to think if they should.&quot;<br/><br/>Just because we can doesn&#39;t mean we should.
