All works made by machine without direct input by a human, including all works made by machine learning (also known as &quot;ML&quot;, &quot;AI&quot;, or &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;, though the latter two are misnomers as there is no actual intelligence in any machine currently or in the foreseeable future) are inherently built by infringing copyright and remixing those copyrighted works. Additionally, there is precedent that non-humans cannot hold copyright -- see Naruto v. David Slater et al.<br/><br/>Computers and &quot;AI&quot; programs are not human and should not be able to hold copyright, any more than an animal should. I urge you to decide, correctly, that &quot;AI&quot; and machine-made works should not be eligible for copyright protections.
