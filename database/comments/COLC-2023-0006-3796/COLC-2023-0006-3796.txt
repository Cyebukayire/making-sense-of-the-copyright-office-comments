I believe that AI-created works should not be able to be copyrighted. A copyright is meant to allow individuals or companies to claim and benefit from their own intellectual property and works. AI is not an entity and does not create new things on its own; it just follows patterns it&rsquo;s been trained on from other works. Moreover, it can be argued that AI infringes on the copyright of existing works if it has ever been trained using them. AI does not think for itself and it does not create from its own ideas, only the ideas of others, so its creations cannot be copyrighted. Additionally, it would be individuals and corporations seeking the copyright for AI creations, so the &ldquo;creator&rdquo; of the work (AI) would still not be the one receiving copyright rights. Finally, because AI doesn&rsquo;t think for itself or have any free will, it cannot be held accountable for whatever it creates, allowing the people who profit from its creations to dodge responsibility if those creations turn out to harm the public in some way. For example, if an AI wrote a paper that was published in a news source and the paper turned out to be misleading or false, the news company could say that it was the AI&rsquo;s fault to avoid any legal claims of slander. Therefore, I believe that not only are there no legal grounds for allowing AI works to be copyrighted, but also that allowing these works the same legal status as works created by people and companies (which CAN be held accountable for their actions and ideas) would open up legal loopholes for skirting responsibility through the use of AI.
