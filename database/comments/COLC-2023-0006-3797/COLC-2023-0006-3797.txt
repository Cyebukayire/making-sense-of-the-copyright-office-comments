I am a professional writer and it seems pretty clear to me that anything generated from AI should not be allowed to be copyright protected. And if any copyrighted material is used to train AI or generate any material, the copyright holders should be compensated fairly. Tech companies must be held accountable and artists and writers should be protected by clear and specific laws. Thank you.
