AI is a distinct danger to our way of life and has impacted creators of every stripe. My daughter and husband are both visual artists and they have had their work scraped by any number of AI learning programs. My daughter recently graduated from art school and has been unable to find work as AI is being brought in to more and more areas of illustration and game design. I believe that only humans can create because machines don&rsquo;t think and human creation MUST be protected.
