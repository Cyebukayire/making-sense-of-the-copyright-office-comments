My concern with AI is that it is not generating new content, but instead sourcing and scraping from what has been made before and just outputting material based on the sum of many other works.  If a musician samples a song, they must pay for the rights. If a movie re-uses a screenplay, they must pay for the rights.  AI does not generate anything completely new - and also avoids paying rights to the people it sourced from.  AI work should not be allowed to be copywritten.
