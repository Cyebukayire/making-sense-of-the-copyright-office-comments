I&#39;m an elementary school teacher, and even at such early grades we&#39;ve had to wrestle with the implications of all of these AI bots in the realm of education. There&#39;s no original thought in these artificial intelligences, only regurgitated data from people whose work was fed to it. In reading work submitted with prompts fed to the AI and copy/pasted to assignments, it&#39;s clear that what is created by the AI bots is not anything original, only recycled. The copyright process is meant to protect the ownership of an individual&#39;s or group&#39;s ideas. What we as citizens and people put out into the world has no business being stolen and fed to a bot to generate stolen ideas. AI&#39;s &quot;contributions&quot; should not be allowed to be put under copyright. Furthermore, anyone&#39;s work should not be fed to an AI without the creator&#39;s explicit permission. I tell my students not to plagiarize and to note their sources all the time. The same process a student goes through in creating a piece of writing for themselves should also apply here.
