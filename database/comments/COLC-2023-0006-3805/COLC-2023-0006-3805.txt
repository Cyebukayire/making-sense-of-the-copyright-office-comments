Copyright should only apply to works made by human beings. AI is not and never will be human, so their &quot;work&quot; should not be protected under copyright law. I think it&#39;s outrageous that AI can steal styles and art from actual human beings when it &quot;creates&quot; something new. You should be focusing more on protecting the rights of living human beings instead of artificial intelligence.
