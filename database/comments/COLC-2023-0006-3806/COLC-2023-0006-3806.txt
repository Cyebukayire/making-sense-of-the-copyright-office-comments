If your using someone else&#39;s image or art or anything from a real person to teach an AI. You should have to pay royalties everytime that Ai is used to generate something. Cause using someone else&#39;s image or art or creative IP that didn&#39;t belong to the AI already and it&#39;s not fair to sample people and not pay them for the work they did to teach the AI. However to do this is ridiculous and would cost everyone to much money. AI should not be used to generate content or sellable things. AI should not be monetary but a tool for everyone to use but not be able to make money off it.
