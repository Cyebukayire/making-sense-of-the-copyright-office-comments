AI as a tool currently can only take, it cannot make new, it can repeat it can steal, and is often trained on material that the trainer has no rights to. But it also does not create writing, art, instructions, a cohesive story or a cohesive study. It can take parts, it can make attempts, it cannot make something new, it can recreate, take word for word, but then that&#39;s just plagiarism; which to be fair, is what AI is built upon. There is a reason that is is fought, that technology is developed to poison AI seeds, because they are taking without permission from people that actually do the work. Not to say that programming isn&#39;t work, but scraping certainly isn&#39;t. Creativity takes work, scraping doesn&#39;t, training something by scraping doesn&#39;t. While AI has it&#39;s uses in its current unregulated state it only damages all of the creatives. Television will be worse, writing will be worse, art will be worse, scientific publications will be worse because it&#39;s become about what you can produce and not if it&#39;s worth producing, not if it&#39;s worth reviewing. It will be homogenized and everything will feel the same because if you drive the creatives out of creating the only thing AI will be able to take from is other AI.
