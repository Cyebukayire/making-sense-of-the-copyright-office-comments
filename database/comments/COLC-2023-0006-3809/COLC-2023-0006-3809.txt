Current regulations are wildly behind the reality of Artificial Intelligence/data scraping and the collection of information online in general. Our personal information is already very poorly protected and for sale across the internet, but with AI our intellectual property is now subject to the same approach. Both of these are an issue. Human beings can steal data/intellectual property of course, but with AI the process has become automated and able to function on a much larger scale, and much faster. We need to be making laws- and finding ways to enforce them, to protect data of all kinds. Otherwise the only option to be safe from AI is to not use the internet at all, an option that is simply not available to function in modern society.
