I am a publisher and want to work only with human authors and human artists. Using AI to scrape previous copyrighted work and &quot;create&quot; &quot;new&quot; work is really ruining the lives of many writers and artists who deserve to create and have their work protected. We are now being inundated by these fake works. I have strong oppositions to AI and the lack of oversight of it.
