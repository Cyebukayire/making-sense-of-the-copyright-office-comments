Many online written works made for free by writers are being scrapped from their websites to be used in AI training. Every single writer I have seen comment on this has said that it completely undermines the purpose of an author, and many have been forced to either private or completely delete their writing so as not to be used in such practices. In the same vein, artists are also being forced into deleting their work so it does not get used in AI training. We as authors completely turn down AI generation, and so do we as artists. It takes the creativity out of the world, making things easier for no one, and harder for those among us with creative talent. It fills the internet and greater world with images and text that are made not by human, but by machine, making the world feel increasingly apocalyptical and impossible to survive in for those who have worked their whole lives in one or more areas of creativity. We are loosing our ability to create, and we don&#39;t like it.
