As a Human-Computer Interaction researcher and as a citizen, the recent widespread use of Artificial Intelligence has me very concerned. As it currently occupies a bit of a gray area, AI has been used to generate content using intellectual property scraped from various websites or databases, often without the knowledge or consent of creators. This poses a threat to businesses, especially small businesses and freelance artists and writers. AI can be a powerful tool, but the data set from which is learns must be sourced ethically. Regulations must be put in place to ensure that going forward AI, especially generative AI, is used ethically and responsibly.
