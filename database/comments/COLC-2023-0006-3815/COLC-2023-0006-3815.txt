Nothing made with A.I should be copyrightable. Even if the company &quot;modifies&quot; the A.I&#39;s output, it&#39;s still produced using stolen data, made by a nonhuman, with the express purpose of pushing humans out of the workforce. If I proofread a research paper, newspaper article or book, I don&#39;t suddenly gain the right to copyright it, even if it wouldn&#39;t otherwise be copyrightable. That&#39;s all the companies trying to copyright A.I generated human edited scripts and images are doing: Editing something they didn&#39;t create and then claiming they own it because they changed some words.
