AI in itself is utilizing already existing works and outputting products that are essentially art theft/plagiarism. It&rsquo;s use should only be referential and not implemented by companies to create a product. There&rsquo;s needs to be federal regulations and protections to prevent corporations to exploit artists/writers/programmers and etc. where using AI can be unethical and remove many jobs for humans.
