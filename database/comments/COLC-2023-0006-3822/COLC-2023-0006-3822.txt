I think AI can be a helpful tool. However, if left largely unregulated, it is a danger to the livelihoods and intellectual property of writers and artists. I think that materials should have been created almost entirely from human effort in order to be eligible for copyright protections. I also think there should be limits to the works AI can learn from in order to protect human made works. It isn&rsquo;t fair for someone to feed an AI a particular artist&rsquo;s portfolio to generate something almost identical to their work, potentially robbing them of commission payment while using their work. <br/>AI should be thoughtfully regulated with input from both technology experts and writers and artists to protect their intellectual property and their livelihood.
