I find the state of generative AI use in the United States to be rampant and highly unlawful/immoral. With other countries such as Italy initially banning GhatGPT on the basis of privacy concerns, I strongly believe that the US needs to follow suit. At the very least, AI usage must be heavily regulated so that any media used to train AIs are taken with consent from the original creator(s) and/or proper compensation. <br/><br/>Amid the ongoing writer &amp; actor strike, and amid titanic companies that seek to wring every penny possible out of workers and consumers alike while neglecting the very people who create their films, shows, etc., all generative AI threatens to do is make this problem worse. It severely devalues human skill and creativity, scoffs in the face of copyright, and more or less can get away with it unimpeded. Our country needs to protect its citizens who only wish to be fairly compensated for our labor and skills. Not just writers, but actors/voice actors (whose likeness and voices are also being stolen by AI programs), artists, etc. <br/><br/>I fully admit that there are cases where AI has been used by creative teams (such as in animation or video game development) to help lessen their workload and more importantly, benefit the actual people on staff. It benefits them because these AI programs are fully within their control. But AI that simply steals or &quot;scrapes&quot; data for the benefit of third parties with no permission or compensation should be deemed unlawful immediately. <br/><br/>If I may digress, it is no small secret among the younger generations of this country that America is viewed as an oligarchy, not a meritocracy. We see every day how companies with more money and power than any of us will ever have (Netflix, Microsoft, Disney, etc.) are largely free to rule as they please. If they want to give unjust wages, they can. If they want to steal from others or their own employees (in terms of money or media), they can. If they want to use AI for whatever purpose they choose, they absolutely can and will. This reality is demoralizing, alarming, and most importantly, going on right now with no sign of stopping. <br/><br/>I myself am a writer. I&#39;m a graduate student pursuing my Masters degree in creative writing, and have spend countless hours of my life honing my craft. And now on the cusp of finally being able to enter the so-called real world to make my contributions to art and culture, I&#39;m now being threatened by AI companies and their supports who claim I&#39;ll become obsolete in just a few short years.<br/><br/>But I and my peers are human, we are citizens of the US, and I believe we deserve protection more than mere technology. We want to see justice enacted and AI regulated not only to keep our prospects, but to keep original, human-made art alive. We deserve dignity and respect, and protection from theft. That is all we want.
