Artificial Intelligences (AI) are not people in that they have not been defined as such by any court or act of Congress. In fact, courts have specifically declined to grant personhood to animals - I doubt they would be more amenable to giving these rights to computer programs.<br/><br/>As AI algorithms are not people I don&#39;t see how they could possibly be afforded the privilege of owning anything, let alone a copyright.
