Uncontrolled use of AI poses a huge risk to creators, as well as creative works. Not only is copyright threatened and violated when works are used to train AI models, but also the livelihoods of creators are being threatened. How can an author who spends months or years painstakingly drafting a novel compete against someone who spends an afternoon feeding prompts into AI and drafting a whole novel (which has been drafted using input from hundreds of novels previously fed into it) over the course of a few hours, which they can then proceed to sell as a self-published work. Regulation and moderation of AI is incredibly important, to protect both copyrights and livelihoods.
