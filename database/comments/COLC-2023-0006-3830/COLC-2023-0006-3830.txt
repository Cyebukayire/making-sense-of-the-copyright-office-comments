Generative, &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; created content is based on theft of existing artwork or writing without the consent of its creators.<br/><br/>What&#39;s more, if it is not based on theft from authors/artists/etc. It thrives on the exploitation of underpaid or unpaid people to pick up the slack.<br/><br/>There are ways that generative AI could surely help the world but not in this way or form. <br/><br/>Thank you!
