As an artist, I did not like the idea that my art could be used to train AI, or that AI could be used to steal my art! <br/>I&#39;m not aware if my art has ever been used to train AI, but the idea of it scares me, as I opt out of my art being used for AI training whenever I can. (Doesnt mean people are going to listen though as an individual can just use my image)
