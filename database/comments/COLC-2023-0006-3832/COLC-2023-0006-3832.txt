Materials generated by AI, either in part or in whole, should not be copyrightable. There is no ethical way to source training data (and no way to remove the data gleaned from stolen data from the models) and a copyright is about protecting human beings from their work being stolen (which is the core of how AI works). Moreover, the ability to copyright AI generated works (to any degree) will lead to the abuse of human workers to edit those creations. This has already happened - companies using AI to generate low quality work and then paying people significantly less than a living wage to &quot;fix&quot; them. AI is a human rights nightmare. Finally, there are currently no environmentally green AI systems and the ability to copyright their creations will lead to more usage, leading to a greater impact on the environment.
