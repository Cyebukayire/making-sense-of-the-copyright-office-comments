I believe generative AI should not be able to use works protected under copyright because it allows others to plagiarize those works. Authors and artists have a right to have their works protected from the theft of other individuals. Works created solely by AI should not be protected by copyright because it was not created by individuals or a group based around an original idea, and instead, uses algorithmic decisions to use the work of others.
