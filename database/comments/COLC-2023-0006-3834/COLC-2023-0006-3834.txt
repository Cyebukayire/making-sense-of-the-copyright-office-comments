As an author, and a supporter of other creatives like digital artists and educators, I am incredibly concerned by the amount of data scraping and stolen content that goes into the &#39;training&#39; of artificial intelligence engines. These programs are being used to replace hardworking artists and authors, using their creative content without permission as a basis, and robbing them of great amounts of paid work that a large company like Disney or Universal--those who are normally the MOST protective of copyright law--can now source to AI engines instead of paying real, hardworking humans to do... using engines trained on the very work of those artists.<br/><br/>AI engines are also being used to &#39;write&#39; books on nonfiction subjects, including truly dangerous ones. There have been reports of AI-written foraging guides, which include dangerous misinformation on topics like &#39;which mushrooms are safe to eat,&#39; due to the AI being &quot;smart&quot; enough to put together words that sound authoritative, but too stupid to understand that it&#39;s telling people to eat poisonous fungi. The fact that the engine could access actual foraging guides in order to have a basis of phrasing, terminology, and scientific illustration to generate new content from is a massive part of how this faulty, dangerous, lawsuit-worthy &quot;book&quot; could exist in the first place.<br/><br/>This experienced forager was the one to alert a lot of people to the dangers of such books, but there are others in that community doing the same: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CwYtzB7tBOA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
