I believe that AI-generated art should not be subject to copyright laws and tribe current ruling on the matter should be maintained. Furthermore, I believe that all human artist&rsquo;s personal work should be protected from being used to generate AI images because that should constitute a violation of copyright. An artist who has the time and skill to create a work should not have to compete with low-effort, computer-generated imitations of their work. To change or adjust the current ruling regarding AI art and copyright would rob human artists of their own work.
