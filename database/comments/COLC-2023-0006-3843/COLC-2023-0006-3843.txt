Hello, as artificial intelligence is not something that is actually producing it&rsquo;s own art, writing, anything really, it should be banned under copyright laws. It scrapes the internet for any and all content it can find and then meshes it all together using the base data it found that was created by someone else. Even if a person has not obtained a copyright on their creation, &ldquo;AI&rdquo; should not be using it. A lot of the artwork that has been scraped into the databases of said &ldquo;AI&rdquo; was done without artists knowledge or consent therefore, stealing from these creators. The base of AI should not be other peoples work. Because that then makes it an algorithm not intelligent. (Which calling it artificial intelligence is a stretch because it does not think for itself or create any original ideas or thoughts but that is a completely different issue). The copyright office should put a stop to AIs nonsensical data scraping. It not only harms artists but it harms businesses too.
