I&#39;m a writer for TV, film and comics. I never thought my career would be on the front line of automation from so-called Artificial Intelligence. The programs these studios want to adopt are nothing more than plagiarism machines, scraping data from copyrighted works, thoughtlessly churning content. The studios will still need writers to come in and fix whatever random scripts AI cranks out, but they will have the excuse they need to not fairly credit or compensate writers. Entertainment is one of our country&#39;s biggest exports, a huge chunk of our largest state&#39;s economy, and, more than that, one of our best tools for spreading our ideals and values across the globe. Why outsource that to machines? Machines that will only further entrench stereotypes and racism we&#39;ve fought so hard to move past in our storytelling the last few years. The trend towards replacing human workers with AI is just another shortsighted cost-cutting effort to increase profit for a single year while threatening to demolish the industry as we know it. Modern capitalism no longer encourages companies to make a better product to capture a larger share of the industry, instead playing an elaborate shell game for investors while starving workers and denying consumers. The promise of automation was to replace the jobs no one wanted and make life easier. No one is asking for this beyond the rich who stand to be made richer and those outside of creative fields who think AI can replace time, study and dedication.
