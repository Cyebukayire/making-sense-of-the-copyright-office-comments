Generative AI is a terrible thing for private companies to own. If we lived in a fantasy socialist utopia where no big corporations existed and there were no jobs to replace I wouldn&#39;t mind if it existed. In the current system we have the only use for generative AI is to replace human artists. If the Federal government isn&#39;t going to do anything for the unions fighting this, then it might as well stop the existential threat itself.<br/><br/>A second, and perhaps more important consideration, is that &quot;artificial inteligence&quot; is not creative, but it&#39;s perfectly alright at making remixes. It can only work when provided with collosal amounts of data, and effectively just looks at what the most likely next word (or pixel or line of code) from it&#39;s dataset would be after using processes learned from said dataset to quantize the context. This means that generative AI only works when fed creative works, which are copyrighted. Many AI companies simply ignore the law, and aren&#39;t being punished for it. The other way to get data is perhaps more insidious. The ubiquitous TOS can merely be amended to say that anything uploaded to Google or Snapchat or TikTok cam be used to train AI, and now said sites have either a new source of revenue selling that, or the start to their own bot, or both. This prevents artists who know what they are doing from getting audiences, as uploading to a large user base could just get their artsyle emulated by a bot, and make the obsolete. Many artists are sueing those who have gotten AI to emulate their style to write more like they do, and this is a massive issue if emulating an artsyle or voice or appearance is not made illigal.
