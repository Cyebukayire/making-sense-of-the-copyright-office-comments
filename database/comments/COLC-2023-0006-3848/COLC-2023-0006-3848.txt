Let me first thank you for taking the time and diligence to open and review public comments on the matter of AI; I am sure that tackling policy on such a controversial and rapidly emerging topic is no small feat.<br/><br/>I am an artist and author working on several projects for eventual wide release, but I am also a friend and fan of many who have already gotten their work out there. The work of making a piece for public consumption is time consuming and exhausting, which is why the work of the copyright office is so important. There is a strong expectation under the law that once a work is out there, it will remain the original Creator&#39;s to do with as they see fit for as long as they see fit, I and my friends rely on that.<br/><br/>This is why I&#39;m strongly against using copyrighted works to train AIs and learning models.<br/><br/>As upheld in courts, AI generated content is not eligible for copyright protection, so even with the original creator&#39;s permission there is no good reason to use AI in place of the creator&#39;s hard work. But besides that point, the fact remains that a copyrighted work remains in ownership of it&#39;s original creator and must not be republished in whole or in part without their permission, and training AIs on those works does just that: the work is held in the AI&#39;s database unless manually purged. Sometimes quite large sections can be recreate wholesale, entirely at random if the algorithm hits the right &quot;query&quot;. <br/><br/>Therefore the only acceptable way to use AIs in this way is on a server wholly owned by the copyright holder, trained exclusively on works they have the legal authority to reproduce. Training AIs that are or may eventually be open to the public on copyrighted works is a violation of the holders&#39; copyright and must be punished under the applicable laws.<br/><br/>Thank you again for your time and I await the forthcoming publication with baited breath.
