As someone who wishes to someday write my own books, you must stamp down this blatant attempt at destroying artists. The companies wish to replace artists and writers with something they can&#39;t pay but are blind to the fact that this will inevitably come crumbling down. People may say that AI will soon write better than people but it never actually will write better for it can&#39;t plan out a story or create a character arc, it only chooses what to write next based on algorithm. So please, STOP THE COMPANIES FROM KILLING US,
