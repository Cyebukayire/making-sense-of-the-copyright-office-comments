I do not believe that Ai created works should be copyrighted. It&#39;s not true artifical intelligence, it is just scraping what already exists with algorithms, stealing styles and eventually corrupting itself with repetition. Even if viewed as a tool/machine, it has already proven to be harmful to the American worker. It&#39;s not taking away dangerous jobs or even boring jobs, but fulfilling jobs. And it&#39;s taking away jobs without replacing them with other jobs or even a universal basic income.
