AI is an attack on artists. If I went through and downloaded movies and copyrighted material and then used them to create a new film, it would be theft. These are actions done without permission or oversight. And it&#39;s a Trojan Horse. Once you allow AI into one industry with copyrights, you let them into all of them. This is theft. No one even questions it.
