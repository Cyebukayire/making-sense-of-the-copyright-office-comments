Allowing AI generated content to be copyrighted would be unfair to the human artists that AI programs steal from, and it would have a disastrous effect on the labor market as more and more companies get rid of hardworking people in favor of machines that repackage and resell their work. AI content lacks human authorship and should not fall under copyright.
