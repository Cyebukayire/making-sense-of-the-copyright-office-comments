On a fundamental level AI art and works are not original and shouldn&#39;t be copyrightable. This is not actually &quot;AI&quot; it&#39;s just machine learning and composition. It takes millions of existing works and makes a composite image or work. It as a method of &quot;creation&quot; actively circumvents trademarks on creative works as most of the images and written works used as a basis are uncredited, unpaid, and privately owned. This would allow for massive loopholes in existing copyright works where if it&#39;s &quot;created&quot; by a machine it can receive a copyright regardless of the original works copyright protectionals.
