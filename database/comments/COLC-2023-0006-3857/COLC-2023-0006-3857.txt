AI should only be trained on material within the public domain. The use of a person&#39;s image without their knowledge or without reasonable compensation should not be allowed if that use is jeopardizing a living person&#39;s livelihood. AI input should be regulated to be as unbiased as possible, over representation of a single demographic or stereotyped representation of a minority should not be allowed.
