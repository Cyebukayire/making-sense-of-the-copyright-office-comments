The use of AI throughout the internet as it currently stands is an ethical violation, if not a labor one. It is theft, pure and simple. It is taking and profiting off of the work of actual humans without their consent and without giving them credit and/or compensation. Regulation is absolutely needed. Affirmative consent from copyright owners for any AI-training is needed. Artistic AI-generated material should not be protected by law or allowed to be copyrighted.
