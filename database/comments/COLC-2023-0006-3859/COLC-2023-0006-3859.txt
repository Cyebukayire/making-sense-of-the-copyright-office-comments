AI generated materials have proven a threat to creative fields first simply because art is subjective. Asking people to care about where their art and entertainment comes from is useless, because asking people to care is futile. But while creative fields may be first, they certainly won&rsquo;t be the last. Once AI-generated illustrations, novels &amp; music crowd out every artist and turn modern cultures across the world into computer-generated slop, then everyone else&rsquo;s jobs are on the line. There is no level of thought or decision making that cannot be replaced - at far worse quality - by a machine. None. Either artists and creatives own the rights to their work and how that work is used, or none of us own anything we&#39;ve ever thought or made, and our lives are public domain.
