The use of machine learning programs or &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; has major cause for concern to me, in that vast amounts of artistic creations are being used without consent or any adherence to copyright. It is obvious that government regulations have been slow to adapt and restrict these machine learning programs. If is my observations that these programs will only be used for the benefit of large organizations/companies at the detriment of tens of thousands of writers, artists, and other artistic creators. Humanity should protect such manners of expression, not give the rights away to the highest bidder, or the biggest corporation. There needs to be both regulation of these AI programs, as well as an enforced measure of transparency to know where these machine learning programs are skimming their data-sets from. This not only helps protect copyrighted material, but also helps towards ensuring that these data sets are not tainted by outside entities wishing to inject erroneous information into the data sets, which could be used by hostile foreign powers to further damage the United States of America.
