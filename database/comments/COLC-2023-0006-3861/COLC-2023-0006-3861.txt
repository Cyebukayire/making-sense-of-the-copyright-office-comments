Generative AI should not be allowed to use copyrighted images, text, audio, etc. without the permission of the copyrighted material&#39;s owner. This AI should follow all the same rules about using copyrighted materials as people do. Along with this, AI produced material should not be able to be copyrighted, as it is not created by a person, but rather by a computer program, and therefore does not have a creator to claim ownership of the generated material. To add to that, generative AI using existing material to create &quot;new&quot; pieces, and therefore nothing generated by an AI is original work but instead a collage of other&#39;s work, made to seem like something new.
