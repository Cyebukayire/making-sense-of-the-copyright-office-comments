My name is Krista Fox, I am a Motion Picture Costumer, about to be sworn into IATSE MPC Local 705. As someone who has worked in creative a field their entire life, I am very worried about the detrimental impact that AI could have on every creative field there is. I have seen firsthand jobs being taken away by AI. For example I work in the made to order sector of costuming. We make clothing come to life for film and television. As of lately we have received commissions from different production companies that have not hired costume illustrators and instead have used AI to convey a costume design. The problem with this is a costume illustrator knows how clothing is made and sewn and AI computers do not. So we have received computer renderings of a dress made by AI and there&rsquo;s no seams, no design details, no way to tell what is fabric and what is not. Because of this gross negligence we lose the job quote because we don&rsquo;t know what they want made and by the time we finish going back and forth with the production company too much time has passed and we cannot make the item in time for their deadline. Which then results in us losing work/a client. And using AI for creative costume renderings also takes the costume illustrators job. A costume illustrator is a highly skilled individual who has had many years of schooling. If their jobs are taken from them then they are out of work. As the United States government it is your duty to protect the citizens of the US and to protect their jobs. This is only one small example of the harmful effects of AI should it go unregulated.
