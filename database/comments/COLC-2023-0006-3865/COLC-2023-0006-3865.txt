I have been afraid to upload my art. People have decided that I am a cog in a machine I never chose to be in, and they have decided that I&#39;m replaceable. I don&#39;t know if my stolen writing will be churned into a machine, stripping any authenticity from my fiction just for their personal greed. They will steal my face, my soul, my heart and my body, till I&#39;m not even in lines of code but the distortion of pixels in thousands of meaningless images or bits of worthless jargon. If they decide I&#39;m replaceable, then I will not let myself be taken. There is less art in the world if there are more thieves.
