AI models are largely trained on copyrighted materials from internet sources, with no notice or compensation to the artists on which they are trained. Additionally, it is difficult if not impossible to opt out of your material being used to train AI models. The use of AI models to create commercial properties based on the training of non-consenting artists presents an existential risk to artists&rsquo; livelihoods, art itself, and artistic culture as a whole.
