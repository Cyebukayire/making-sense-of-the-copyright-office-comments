Because current AI systems are not true Artificial Intelligences and instead algorithms trained on the artwork and creations of other people, it isn&#39;t creating anything new. It&#39;s creating amalgamations of what it&#39;s been trained on and if trained with a specific artist&#39;s work will create works in that artist&#39;s style that are near to if not almost entirely identical to works already created. The original artist of course should be able to copyright their works but AI systems using their work and replicating it are barely different from other copyright claims when someone steal&#39;s an artists work and claims ownership or uses it for profit. On the off chance that an AI could create something entirely unique however, using any artist&#39;s work that is used to train it should be through the artist&#39;s consent because it is still THEIR artwork and the AI system is using their work for potential profit.
