I believe that our creations not only have to be remunerated when used to teach an AI system, but I also believe AI results (images, sound, videos, screenplays, books...) shouldn&#39;t be allowed to be copyrighted.<br/><br/>My reasons for requiring compensations are the costs it took all of us (monetary and in time dedicated) to learn to do our creations.<br/><br/>To create, you have to learn, to learn you usually have to pay. You could pay a library to use their books, you could hire a teacher or pay for an education at a school or college, or you could hire a professional to teach how to create, no matter if it is to take your photos, to write a story, to draw an illustration, to film a movie...<br/><br/>You also have to take into consideration the high amount of hours of practice that you need to spend in order for you to achieve a good result. You don&#39;t get good results by just learning the theory, you have to practice. As we always say, practice makes perfection. That practice requires lots of time and dedication.<br/><br/>For those reasons and the many others that the rest of the people commenting will mention, I believe remuneration is necessary because if the AI only needs a few seconds to acquire all the knowledge that it took us many years and it doesn&#39;t even pay for that learning, how is it fair to us? <br/><br/>Also, the economics of this are obvious. It&#39;s always been clear that you pay for what you get, so if you want to use people&#39;s creations to teach the machine, you should be forced to pay for them. <br/><br/>On the other hand, copyrighting AI results (such as images, videos, texts, stories, etc.) shouldn&#39;t be allowed. <br/>Copyright is defined by the Oxford dictionary as &quot;the exclusive and assignable legal right, given to the originator for a fixed number of years, to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material&quot;. <br/>This dictionary considers that the word originator means &quot;a person who creates or initiates something.&quot;. <br/>And if you use the definition of create, you get &quot;bringing something new or original into being&quot;. <br/>That means that copyrighting something coming from an AI is impossible, since the AI is the one doing it (even if a person asks, the AI provides the result) and an AI isn&#39;t an originator because it isn&#39;t a person.<br/><br/>To this I can also add the factor of &quot;new or original&quot; of the definition. When a person creates something, they use references, true, but they also provide their unique life experiences (events of their life, situations they&#39;ve seen, moments they&#39;ve lived, sentences they&#39;ve heard...). Those experiences are the things that bring the originality and newness to the equation. <br/>An AI has no life to take from, no experiences to use. An AI just uses the things others make, applies a random combination to them, and gives you a result. That would mean that what an AI gives you isn&#39;t original.<br/><br/>For the reasons above, AI results shouldn&#39;t be allowed to be copyrighted.
