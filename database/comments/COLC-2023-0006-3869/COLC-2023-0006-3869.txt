AI could be used as a tool to help improve humanity, however; with the way corporations are utilizing it&#39;s abilities, it will only cause problems for our future, such as job security. AI should be used for problem solving and calculations, and not to replace, and eventually rid entirely, an entire group of employees such as semi drivers, cashiers, artists, and writers.

AI may still be utilized, but only as a tool.
