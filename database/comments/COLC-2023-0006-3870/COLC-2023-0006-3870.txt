My name is Bryan Syme. And I am a freelance illustrator who works primarily in the field of TT RPGs such as Dungeons and Dragons. I am one of the people whose work was scraped off the internet without my consent or compensation and used to create a program in direct competition with me and my fellow artists. These programs would not exist without that theft.  If a person were to take someone&#39;s intellectual property and use it to create a book, TV show, or video game, why is it all right for them to take it to create a program? Not only is this theft of me and my fellow artists intellectual property it threatens our very ability to make a living. If artists are no longer able to make a living from being an artist there will be no more artists. It is a skill that we need to devote almost all of our time to to develop and become better. And if we can no longer do that there will be no more Michael Whelan&#39;s, Todd Lockwood&#39;s, Rembrandt&#39;s or David Bowie&#39;s. And human creativity will be reduced to nothing more than repetitive content based on the art that came before.
