Well obviously certain kinds of advances in technology can be hugely beneficial to people and productivity and wealth generation, the dangers that AI poses to not just the entertainment industry and creators overall, but also to the stability of an informed electorate and a broad grasp on reality for that said electorate, AI and GAI pose incredibly risks to society overall.<br/><br/>As an artist, I believe that strong limits should be placed on all uses of AI and generative AI so as to not completely disrupt the entertainment industry and artist communities and also to make sure that society remains believable. This could be shaped in a total outright down, or some sort of barcoding or meta-data tagging which is a removable from all generated works so that material can be verified as real or not real. These disruptions could lead to literally thousands if not millions of people out of work and homelessness, food insecurity, and other ills to be forced onto people who would otherwise be productive members of society.<br/><br/>AI is the biggest threat to the general public, even beyond the dangers of climate change which threaten the entire existence of civilization and the abilities of humans to thrive on planet earth.<br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration,<br/>William Wedig<br/>Writer/director/editor<br/>American filmmaker<br/>www.williamwedig.com<br/>917-686-6439
