I&#39;m writing to voice my concern over the widespread breach of copyrighted material that has taken place over time, in order to feed the emerging AI plagiarism&nbsp;software systems.&nbsp; For what purpose have we all copyrighted our scripts and novels, musical compositions and motion pictures (with all the performances included therein), if not to protect them from outside theft and regurgitation.&nbsp; Which, make no mistake, is EXACTLY what AI material-mining/plagiarism&nbsp;is.&nbsp; Every single AI platform should now be required to present proof of permission to use or copyright transfer documentation for every cobbled-together piece of new art, story, outline, script, novel.&nbsp; Given the advanced nature of the plagiarism&nbsp;software, certainly the theft process can be reversed to reveal the ROOT of each copyright infringement, ie the material from which the AI-generated product has illegally siphoned.It&#39;s CHAIN OF TITLE time. We didn&#39;t file all our copyrights for fun times and good health.&nbsp; We did it to protect our intellectual property from theft, be it at human or computer-generated hands.Thank you for your swift and decisive attention to this matter.<br/>Sincerely, seana kofoed (actor/writer/producer).
