As an artist who has many copyrighted works, and many more under the Creative Commons license, etc. I wholeheartedly believe there should be regulations against AI training on our works. There is no other way to frame this. What is done with AI is outright theft of work, often for profit. This should not be allowed to continue, especially when it already has real world implications of job loss for actual artists and creators.
