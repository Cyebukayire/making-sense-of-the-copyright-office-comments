Hello, I am a member of SAG-AFTRA, the film actors&rsquo; union. We are presently on strike for a number of reasons, but one reason presently relevant is AI and its relationship to intellectual property.<br/><br/>I act both as a principal (lines, screen credit, a &ldquo;role&rdquo;) and as a background artist/extra. AI issues impact both jobs.<br/><br/>As a principal actor, our voice and body movements are our stock in trade, the items that earn our wage and create value for our employers. AI can create a threat to this in two ways: first, in the more obvious manner of being able to recreate these qualities without our involvement (or consent, especially for non-&ldquo;name&rdquo; actors forced to work on minimum contracts). We see in deep fake technology how well these copies can work to the naked eye.<br/><br/>The second way is more invisible: using this &ldquo;performance data&rdquo; from the catalogs of films they own, studios can &ldquo;train&rdquo; AI to make &ldquo;new&rdquo; performances based on aggregated data. It&rsquo;s not new or original but rather a remixed aggregate performance that can more and more effectively emulate &ldquo;what a person walks/talks/emotes/etc like&rdquo;. The raw material is still our stock in trade movements and voices.<br/><br/>This technology threatens to hurt the background performer even more. These blue collar, hourly working jobs can be replaced wholesale by these same digital golems, whether as &ldquo;scanned&rdquo; copies (which companies have already been using for years on VFX-heavy shows), or as mass training data for &ldquo;original&rdquo; digital extras. A sea of people in the background that a computer learned to make &ldquo;look like&rdquo; real humans.<br/><br/>The two jobs intersect when you consider that, like me, many principle actors start their careers in the background. So in cases where a background career advances and becomes a principal or even a star, the possibility exists that because of their background work, a studio owns this person&rsquo;s &ldquo;body scan&rdquo; already. In perpetuity. With no limitations. So who is to say they don&rsquo;t use the legally acquired data of a day-playing extra to get &ldquo;free&rdquo; performances from someone who is now a big star?<br/><br/>AI should concern the studios as well. These catalogs of film and performance are their intellectual property already, and AI models have been absorbing and training off of them for years. The work owned by WB, Disney, Netflix, etc, are already being used as the source data for scores of language and image modeling programs. It is a rare case where our fight as actors should be their fight as well. We are all owners, and all being stolen from.
