AI training itself on any copyrighted material, or even material that the original creator hasn&#39;t consented to (such as AI scraping voices, videos, blogs, or art posts online), is unethical, and should not be allowed. It especially should not be allowed in contexts where the person using AI is then trying to profit off of the generated content in any way. Artists, writers, animators, and actors all make their living from their art. It would be one thing if AI were truly creating its own versions of these things. But it is, in reality, just the AI stealing other people&#39;s work wholesale, ripping off little pieces of it, and mashing them together. This is plagiarism, plain and simple. AI generated content should be highly regulated, especially when it comes to for-profit uses. Art theft and plagiarism are serious offenses, and AI generated content should be treated no differently.
