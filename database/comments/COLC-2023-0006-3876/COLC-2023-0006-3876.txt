AI-generated works should not be copyrightable. That includes AI-generated work that is then &quot;touched up&quot; by a human. Copyright is meant to protect creators from having their assets exploited without their consent. Current AI systems have been created by using the work of others without consent, and are therefore a copyright violation in and of themselves. Until regulations are made concerning what materials AI are allowed to use, and to what extent, the US government should not treat AI works the same as human works, nor should they be allowed copyrights.
