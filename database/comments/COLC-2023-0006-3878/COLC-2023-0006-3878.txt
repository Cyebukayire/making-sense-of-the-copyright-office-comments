I believe &quot;AI&quot; scraping absolutely infringes upon copyright and should be legislated against. Creators are having their work sampled without their consent. So long as these systems are trained on content they have no right to access, it is plagiarism and theft, and giving the people who actually did the work no credit or compensation.
