AI models need to be regulated more heavily in regards to copyrighted content, specifically items that infringe upon the likenesses, voices, and creations of real people. It is vital that limitations be placed on corporations and studios to utilize AI in creative contexts, such as the ongoing controversy of studios paying a flat rate to use an actor&#39;s likeness and voice in perpetuity for profit via AI. It is completely unjust for a commercial entity to have this kind of power, one that is clearly meant to skirt fair compensation for creatives who work for these entities. I urge you to consider implementing strategies that regulate the usage of AI in service of protect content creators&#39; livelihoods. Furthermore, I strongly recommend that further research and development be utilized in the implementation of these engines in all contexts of American society. Much of this technology is new, and while the possibilities of its application are exciting, we must work to ensure that the output is truthful and for the betterment of humanity, not another tool that sows discord between the citizens of America and the world at large.
