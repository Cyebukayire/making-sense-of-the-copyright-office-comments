AI functions by plagiarism. It&#39;s algorithm is trained with original works, both written and visual art, without the knowledge or consent of the creators. What it produces is, more often than not, plagiarized heavily from these works. There are scripts that can be programmed into a website to prevent AI from stealing from it, but most sites where artists and writers must post their portfolios in order to get work do not have those scripts. A person should not have to purchase their own site and learn to code in order to not get stolen from. Furthermore, the widespread use of these AIs to automate creativity and replace human beings is causing a labor crisis. I personally would like to see significantly heavier legal protections for writers and artists to prevent the theft of their hard work.
