I firmly believe that giving the material AIML models make the ability to copyright is deeply immoral. Why? Because these models do not take inspiration from subjects like humans do. They instead plagiarize the work of people and then Frankenstein it together in an attempt to make something new. The resulting product is an insult to writers, artists, and humanity alike. Many people, myself included, often do not consent to their work being used to train these machines either. What should give a corporation the right to use my artwork, art that I have trained for decades to create, without permission to train a machine that they will only use to replace myself and my peers? Nothing should. That is theft. Theft should not be given the right to copyright, especially when the result is purely uncreative, sterile, and lacking of emotion. The human touch in art, writing, music, and more, is what makes it special. Without emotion, without intention, what do you have? Nothing special.
