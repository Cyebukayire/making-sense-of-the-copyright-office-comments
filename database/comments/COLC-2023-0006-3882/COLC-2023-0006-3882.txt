AI, on its face, could have been an amazing tool, but how its been used in the industry has spit on every creative product I have seen with no respect at all. I have friends who write and draw and the reality or their work being scraped, blended and spit out by a device with no recompense is disgusting. Private information, sensitive things, photos. AI projects that specifically reference an artists or authors name to specifically steal their style to profit over someone elses work and brand. <br/><br/>And no transparency on whats been used or ways to actually remove what&#39;s been used in a database. If an industry can&#39;t work without stealing work from artists, authors, voices, photographers and more, claiming the costs too great or onerous to do, then it does not mean they should be able to steal all that work. AI voices can get people to say things they never would, admit to things that never happened, and the companies just pretend they aren&#39;t culpable for the reality they&#39;ve made possible with what they&#39;ve stolen from movies, news, cartoons.<br/><br/>No respect for the law, no respect for creators, no respect at all for anything except exploiting and profiting off other peoples work. I strongly urge that no AI product could ever be eligible for copywrite.<br/><br/>AI created products are built on theft.
