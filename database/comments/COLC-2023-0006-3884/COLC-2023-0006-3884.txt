As a creator, I have to say that the use of AI is at best, thievery, and at worst a destroyer of jobs. In the fragile economy full of strikes and worry over robots taking jobs over humans, greenlighting the use of AI to learn what humans create would create a future landscape where no one would be able to make money, because only companies would have AI workers. This would lead to a steep economy crash.
