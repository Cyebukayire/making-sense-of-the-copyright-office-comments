As a poet, AI is terrifying. I took all of my work off of websites and forums in hopes nothing can steal it. I don&#39;t think AI should be able to copywrite a stolen style of art or writing. AI is not human, it cannot create art because it cannot conceive art, which is why it steals. If I copy a Van Gogh, it doesn&#39;t get sold as my work, nor should ai generated work based off of someone else&#39;s. Ever.
