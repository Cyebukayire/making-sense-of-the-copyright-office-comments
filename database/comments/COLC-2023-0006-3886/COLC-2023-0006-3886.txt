My simple recommendation is that AI generated art be treated the same as any other WITH the assumption that it has been modified by a human being to a reasonable extent. Laws already allow people to derive others&#39; work, and even when it does not, the creative freedoms that people take by making something &quot;similar&quot; without copying exactly, is what AI already does. AI takes information the same way we use inspiration; no 2 results are alike, nothing is a carbon-copy.<br/><br/>While I am not a professional artist, I have spent many many hours, far more than required by a professional; to make things that others have derived their own art from. I believe that this is not only fair, but reasonable human expression. Copyright laws are meant to keep work that I make, my own. It does not bar anyone else from deciding they want to make a painting, a photograph, a song, a movie, a video game; or anything else as similar as possible without crossing the bounds. AI is just doing what we humans do, faster. Should I be able to create 10,000 images using ONLY AI, and say I own it? No. Should I be able to use AI to create a picture, a poem, a story, a painting, a &quot;photograph,&quot; or a song as a template on where to begin and complete it to make my own works I can then claim ownership to? Absolutely. AI, after-all, is trained on what it can find existing on world through computers, which is where most modern people derive their creative inspiration from. <br/>Take a photograph for example, I can sculpt a statue and the middle of a town square. The statue is mine, the property is that of the city. Now a photographer can come along, take a fancy photo, filter it up, and copyright that image. A photo, of art they didn&#39;t create, on property they don&#39;t own, without me even being aware, and just like modern laws, if I feel infringed, I can contest that using our legal system. Why should AI be any different, it shouldn&#39;t. I cannot infringe on the rights of others&#39; property and call it my own, but AI does not do that. Artists, painters, inventors, comedians, engineers, musicians,all gather inspiration from the that which has come before them; and what is around them now. That is AI, simply, it is human nature that we&#39;ve automated. No different from your phone replacing a calendar, no different from your car on autopilot, no different from land lines becoming cell phones, becoming smart phones that are now cameras too. It&#39;s just the evolution of technology.<br/>How I feel the Copyright office should deal with this;<br/>I feel it is up to the Copyright office to simply require submissions to include whether or not the submission was made using AI, and prohibit something from being 100% AI generated. A human mind must be involved, and the Copyright is then still, works of a person, not a computer. Citing in the Copyright it &quot;came from AI&quot; would allow statistical data to exist, and the Copyright office to then know whom made it, and provide proof of the re-visioning they have done.<br/>Again, creative differences already exist in logos, business names, paintings, sculptures, and day-to-day inventions all the way up to the patent level. Should everyone who has ever created a new kind of water bottle be told they don&#39;t own the rights to that because someone else did something &quot;similar&quot; to it first? No.
