I&#39;ve been training AI for a bit now, so I am familiar with what goes into their production. The sheer volume of what is needed can be staggering, and there&#39;s a great temptation to take other&#39;s work to make it. But this is tantamount to theft of individual ideas and properties. The issue is less about what products are being produced and more about where it is acquired from. I believe that an AI&#39;s generated materials should hold the same level of copyright as any other product and that any source used to train it must be properly compensated for their work. Consider that many different engineers, mechanics, and manufacturers are all paid for the development of a new vehicle, but do not have ownership of the finished product. If these employees are not properly compensated or are deceived in its main purpose, is that not theft? If AI is to continue providing free art, stories, or consultations, their being trained is no different than paying employees for their work, and those that are used to help train the AI must be accredited for their contributions.
