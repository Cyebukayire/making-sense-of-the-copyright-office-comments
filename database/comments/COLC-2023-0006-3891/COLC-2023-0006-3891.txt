I&#39;m not much of an artist, but I don&#39;t believe AI works should be copyrighted as anyone can use AI to generate an image, and it ultimately would undermine the people who actually put in the time and effort to master their art style/craft. Anyone can slap a prompt for writing, drawing, or even for voice-overs into an AI program/generator, and as such, I don&#39;t believe AI generated work should be copyrightable. It would ultimately just be a huge mess, and undermines legitimate artists, whether voice actors or visual artists. There should be a clear line between artwork made by humans and artwork made by a program.
