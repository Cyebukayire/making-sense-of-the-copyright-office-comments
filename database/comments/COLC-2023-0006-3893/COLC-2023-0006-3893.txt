As a newly-published author and artist, I find AI generators, as they are currently built, taught, and run, to be a violation of the copyrights of all the works used to train them. In addition, the use of free, easily-accessible machine-generated &ldquo;art&rdquo; creates situations where real creators are being hurt financially and personally. One only has to look as far as the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes to see how AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; hurts people in those industries. In the field of short story publication, the respected and established literary magazine Clarkesworld was forced to close its submissions due to the deluge of machine-generated stories, immediately hurting all authors hoping to submit their works that they had slaved over for months.<br/><br/>While I think there are potentially useful applications of learned language model text and model-generated artwork, I think the current models built on unethically sourced content, in clear violation of the copyrights held by the original creators of the works, is the &quot;poison pill&quot; that destroys any utility these models might have had. Until models are ethically built, and the use of them a required disclosure (for example, articles must say &quot;llms have been used to generate part or all of this text&quot;), and the acknowledgement made that these model-generated creations are not art, cannot be copyrighted as art, and have no place being treated as a replacement for art (but rather as a supplement), there&#39;s no way llms and art generators can be allowed to grow. It&#39;s my opinion that the current existing models need to be destroyed, and replaced by models built using ethically sourced datasets.
