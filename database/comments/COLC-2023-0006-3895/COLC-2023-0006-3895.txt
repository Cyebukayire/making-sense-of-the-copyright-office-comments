It is important to note that writers and artists create for a living. Copyright was established to protect inventors and creators from having their work stolen and preventing them from making a living. &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is just a new way of trying to subvert copyright. It doesn&#39;t create anything new: it uses techniques and styles from others to create patchwork conglomerates. Creators need to be protected from such usage.
