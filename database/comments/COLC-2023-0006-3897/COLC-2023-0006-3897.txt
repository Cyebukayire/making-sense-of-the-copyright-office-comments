Copyright is important to protect the progress of science and useful arts. As an author, I strongly oppose AI using my intellectual property without my consent, or any form of compensation. It has also been proven in many studies that AI generative tools plagiarize the words of human creators like myself. Any books or other creative content generated by AI should not be eligible for copyright because it, by its nature, is infringing upon the intellectual property of others, and by doing so is inhibiting my constitutional right to the pursuit of happiness. An AI cannot create because it has no consciousness. It can only parrot back the content myself and others like me created.
