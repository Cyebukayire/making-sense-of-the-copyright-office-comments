AI created media and media functions should not be copyrightable. They are trained on hundreds of thousands of images, often completely without consent, created by humans. These machines cannot create on their own-they are regurgital. It is a disservice to copyright law that a copyrightable work stolen or even lended to a machine may become itself copyrighted. This I believe would be an affront to art and artists worldwide.
