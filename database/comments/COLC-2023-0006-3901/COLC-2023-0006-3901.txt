I am a writer and director working in the entertainment industry, and I am calling upon the US copyright office for strict regulation and oversight regarding AI.  This is a unregulated tool that will destroy the notion of human creation and patent rights without proper rules and protections  in place, particularly for artists.  As of now, AI has been used for nothing else but to diminish intellectual property and create a new loophole for corporations to plagiarize work autonomously, which will spell disaster not just for artists, but for all creators and copyright holders across all sectors in broader society.  I urge the US copyright office to recognize this urgent moment and to study, regulate and enforce new policies that will prevent the downfall of intellectual property rights as we know it.  Thank you.
