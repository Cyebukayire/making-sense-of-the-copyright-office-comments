The way &#39;AI&#39; works now is to take work that other people have made (almost always without consent) and feeds it into an algorithm. The &#39;AI&#39; has not made an original work. It remixes the content it has been given. It only knows how to edit stolen work. The problem is the &#39;AI&#39; is not learning anything. It is not advanced enough at its current stage. There is no Intelligence in the &#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39; yet. This is why all the art it makes looks so unhinged and distorted. No one is taking the time to train it properly. This is not a true AI. If you take away its database of stolen art the program is unable to make anything. A true AI would not need this database and would be able to create art without it.<br/><br/>A true AI would first be taught how art works the basics and fundamentals with famous examples for reference. A true AI would be able to take these essential skills and references and create something brand new all on its own. It would not need a database of stolen art from random people. It would not need an algorithm. We are not at this stage. We do not have really AI yet. There is a chance we will start to see something like this in the next 10 years or maybe sooner at this rate but we need to call out these art theft programs for what they are.<br/><br/>What these programs do is have someone who feeds the enter library of Deviant Art into it and tells the program to make more. The program does not understand what it&#39;s making, it does not understand how art works. It takes what it is given and Frankenstein&#39;s it into something else. All without consent or credit from the artists. imagine spending weeks working on a piece. Finally uploading it to show your friends and some random person just downloads it and puts it into their program that then tries to make a &#39;better&#39; version. Again because this program has not been trained on how art works the &#39;better&#39; version is distorted and it&#39;s obvious your work was stolen. These programs are just advanced art theft and we need to stop acting like it&#39;s not. We do not have AI yet. We are in the baby stages of what will eventually be AI but in order to achieve real AI we need to stop acting like these algorithms are anything more than what they are. This whole conversation is an insult to artists. This conversation ignores the very real theft that is happening and by approving these works you are telling real artists and art thieves alike that you do not value the artist. If these programs are approved it will only get worse. What happens when artists stop sharing their work for fear of it being stolen? What happens when these programs are the only public art we see? Imagine if Chat GPT was the only source for new TV shows and movie scripts because you made the real writers too scared to share their work. That is whats going to happen. <br/><br/>Am I being a touch dramatic sure, but I only to show just how terribly this can go wrong and the real implications it will have on not just our lives but the future or art as we know it. I&#39;m not against AI and it will be cool to see what it will make but we need to acknowledge that what we are talking about right now is NOT AI. What we are talking about now is a program that doesn&#39;t know the difference between green and blue. Yes, the programming has been improving but it&#39;s still just that a program. A true AI makes self-adjustments and does not require outside updates. Please say no. Please do not allow these programs in.
