Shari Brown<br/><br/>Human creators should have to affirmatively consent (opt in) to having their work used for training AI. AI companies and users should be required to notify the relevant authors/creators that their works are being used to train their models and generators, whether the author has been previously notified or not and regardless on if the work has been licensed or not. Otherwise, the elements of the work, if not the work itself, is stolen and this infringes upon the author&rsquo;s natural copywright and intellectual property. Unless the work has been explicitly licensed for AI use by the original creator or perhaps is part of Creative Commons, the work cannot and should not be automatically authorized for AI training. Any work generated by non-humans using human-made creations should be not-for-profit and exclusively for personal use, unless explicitly allowed and/or licensed by that original creator whose work has been used. For-profit AI generation is not only immoral but also creates unfair competition in which both parties are using the same work. I am an author and an artist and I feel that use of my work in AI generators is comparable to stealing my intellectual property.
