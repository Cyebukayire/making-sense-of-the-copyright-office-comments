AI has changed drastically in such a short period of time, almost frighteningly so. If the goal of the American government is to stimulate growth and promote small business, there needs to a crack down on AI and copyright law and now. Right now there are countless individuals striking from the WGA and SAG because AI threatens their livelihoods. Writers and artists are having their work scalped from the Internet everyday to feed into AI programs like ChatGPT, Rytr, Craiyon, and DeepAI with little to no consequence.<br/> <br/>AI is an invaluable tool in certain scenarios, but it has just as much potential to be harmful to the public. It becomes harder and harder to determine what is real and unreal. Whole news articles and photos generated by AI can be used to create a false narrative for whomever is concocting it. There needs to be protections in place for the people, the creators, who cannot defend against big named corporations. It is exhausting to see countless companies get away with egregious deeds daily. There needs to be better protections now.
