Hi there, Jason Swanson, computer engineer here. I think we should tread very carefully regarding the subject of AI and copyright. If we allow it then we give corporations yet another tool to abuse the people and skip out on paying who actually put in hard work to make content in all its various forms. That being said, I think there may be a case specifically for when the AI used to generate the content is trained only on data that that is fully owned, copyrights and all, by the person or entity that is running the AI. Anyway, those are my thoughts. Please don&#39;t let corporations put copyrights on generated garbage without protections to those who own the data.
