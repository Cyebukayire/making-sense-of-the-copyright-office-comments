AI is going to destroy the backbone of society by stripping all the best parts of being human away. Companies already don&rsquo;t want to pay artists and writers what they&rsquo;re owed for creative contributions, and AI, as it stands right now, is nothing more than machine plagiarism. It&rsquo;s not true artificial intelligence and it steals from original creative works in order to generate derivatives. This strips humans of their right to own their own creative work, and it enables companies to get away with essentially stealing creative IP. This will have unforeseen disastrous effects on how society operates. It&rsquo;ll destroy so many jobs in the name of the bottom line, and it&rsquo;ll ultimately cost untold billions of dollars for the state to support the people who are put out of their livelihoods by what essentially amounts to intellectual theft. AI is dangerous and should be extremely limited in how it can and should be used, if at all. A world with AI taking over creative industries isn&rsquo;t a world worth living in, in my opinion. As a writer, I&rsquo;d rather just die.
