There is no reason for ai generated media to be even considered for copyright. AI must be trained on already existing material (that is often copyrighted itself) and can only attempt to replicate what it was given. Because of this AI cannot generate anything on its own merit. <br/>Allowing AI generated media will have a detrimental effect on human arts and expression as larger companies will quickly replace the artists with machines that can only copy past work. This model will be unsustainable as well as eventually AI will run out of human media and start to train on its own generated media which causes its output to degrade.<br/>Generative AI media has no place receiving copyright protection and giving it protection will harm all but those selling it.
