The rise of so-called Artificial Intelligence, also known as Machine Learning, is detrimental to Copyright law. Companies and independent programmers are scraping data from websites without permission from neither website owners or content creators. YouTube, ArtStation, WordPress, and more... AI tends to prey on those artists and authors who have little means to defend themselves.<br/><br/>Additionally, there tends to be no human oversight or accountability when generated content is published, leading to harmful or even deadly consequences while the programmer continues to make money. Incidents include the New Zealand app that told users how to create chlorine gas as a refreshing drink, and plant foraging &quot;guides&quot; on Amazon that label poisonous mushrooms as perfectly safe. <br/><br/>While it helps that works created by Artificial Intelligence programs cannot be copyrighted, the law needs to hold the programmers accountable for the theft of protected works. AI databases should only be filled with works in the public domain, or works that the programmer has express permission to use. On top of that, any intended use for the public must have human oversight to prevent harm to individuals. And still, the law must uphold the decision that AI generated works are not copyrightable. A program spitting out a generated sentence is no different from a machine that produces toilet paper.
