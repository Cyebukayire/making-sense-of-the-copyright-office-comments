I am of the belief that Artificial Intelligence as described today is being used to skirt creators rights to their creations. This technology has already been abused while unregulated, with individuals or corporations scraping art off of the internet with no regard to the creators consent, not even crediting artists in their works. This scraped data is then used to &quot;create&quot; art, which can be specified to circumvent an artist themselves in favour of a software that attempts to replicate their works via advanced machine learning algorithms. <br/>I strongly believe that this blatant disregard for artists rights should be much more heavily regulated, both to prevent further theft and to avoid this phenomenon spreading to more fields such as acting, singing, etc. This technology enables suitably encouraged individuals to get content from creators without their consent or knowledge beforehand, and should not be able to so easily.
