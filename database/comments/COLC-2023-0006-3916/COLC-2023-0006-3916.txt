As stated in Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, &quot;The Congress shall have Power ...To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited TÄ±mes to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&quot; Copyright law was created to protect creators, and allowing works to be taken without the consent of their creators and plugged into AI models violates this law.<br/><br/>AI work should only be used to train an AI program when the creator of the work has clearly stated that they consent to it. Many artists&#39; work have been plugged into AI models to train them without their consent. One artist had his work plugged into an AI model without his consent that was trained to replicate his style and create images solely using his work. This should not be legal, especially if the person who generated the image tries to make money off of the image.  Voice actors face a similar issue. Many voice actors have stated that they do not consent to their voices being replicated by AI. One video game&#39;s voiceovers consisted of many voice actors&#39; voices replicated with AI. The actors were unaware of the game using their voices until it released, and then they learned of it, many expressed discomfort and disappointment about their voices being used without their consent. At the very least, they should have gotten compensated by the company that made the game. This too is stealing and should not be permitted by law.<br/><br/>Unless regulations are made to control AI and how people can use it, creators will not be able to have control over their intellectual properties.  Stealing the works of creators and using them in any AI model is unconstitutional and should not be permitted.
