As a graphic designer by trade and amateur writer, I find the unregulated use of AI very concerning. Right now, most text and image based AIs are trained on copyright works while the work sampled are not properly accredited, and artists not properly compensated. If there is a model for AI to be trained solely on public domain work and for artists to opt into AI training datasets with royalties, then it can be ethical. Creators deserves respect and recognition for the work they produce, whether professionally or shared online for free.
