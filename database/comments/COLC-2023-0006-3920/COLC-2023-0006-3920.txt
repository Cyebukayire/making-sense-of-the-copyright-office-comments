I personally don&#39;t believe that AI generated art constitutes actual art. The images generated by AI are en mass cobbled together from pre-existing images which were made by humans, which could not have been made without humans ergo I can&#39;t help but feel that AI generated art is not really art but rather theft. For these reasons I do not feel as though AI generated content should be capable of being copyrighted.
