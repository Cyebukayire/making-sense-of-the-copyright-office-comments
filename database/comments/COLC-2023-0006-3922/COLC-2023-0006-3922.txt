From my understanding, A.I images take from images that have been previously created by various artists and &lsquo;assembles them in to an image marketed as &lsquo;new&rsquo;. Whilst the technology is new, this process of assembling pieces has been around for decades. Retouching, especially on the lower budget end of the market, regularly makes use of stock images. Cutting up and assembling in to a &lsquo;new&rsquo; images for commercial and artistic gain. The &lsquo;new&rsquo; resulting image is then subjected to its own copyright claims and commercial buyouts.<br/><br/>What has changed with the event of A.I images is the need to buy licensee from the various artists that created the source imagery. This is a trade of money for time, by buying stock images, a project can achieve a deadline or negate the need to budget for original content. The downsides of this, is that by speeding up the project, we also circumvent the need to pay human beings, less money goes in to the economy and the industry becomes smaller as a result. A.I is a further advancement of this, circumventing the need to buy licenses to use the imagery that allows it to exist. No longer does the artist get paid for their fair share allowing a commercial project to run on time but instead markets the ability to take freely from all sources. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of being a chef, potentially award winning, but having stolen all the ingredients from the store. We don&rsquo;t NOT pay the grocery store because we are making a pie. A system of licensing need to be put in place so that the sourcing that allows A.I to existed does not cease. If A.I uses 6 images then 6 images license need to be purchased. The gain is the time saved on a commercial project.
