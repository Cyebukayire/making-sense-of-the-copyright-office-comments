AI has no place as being copyrightable, as it lacks any unique identity or distinguishing characteristics. In addition, it will be heavily abused to short change creatives of all fields, including but not limited to art, music, voice acting, writing, and potentially more. It should not be allowed to be copyrighted as larger companies will simply abuse them to keep them from having to pay their workers for these creative fields.<br/><br/>Please, do ensure that government regulations are put in place to prevent the degradation and loss of creative works as we know them.
