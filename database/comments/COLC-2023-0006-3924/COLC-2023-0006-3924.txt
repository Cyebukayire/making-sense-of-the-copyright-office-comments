AI cannot generate &quot;new&quot; content--only regurgitate compilations derived from human-based materials. AI is not sentient. It stands then that remixed-human work spit out by a computer program should not be copyrighted. The original human artists should be credited instead. If the work draws from too many sources to credit, even then, it should not be copyrighted. Only the work of sentient and sapient minds should be protected. AI is not alive in any sense. Its work does not deserve protection.
