I feel as though images and text produced by what we call &quot;AI&quot; cannot be owned by a singular person, since the images and text were not created by that person. If a machine were to generate a paper based on a prompt, we would, in years past, have called that plagiarism. Now, though, we call it art. I find that to be completely and utterly wrong, and I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s even a discussion on this.
