We all know that the current so-called AI models are full of stolen art. That there has been precious little actual interest from any of the personalities driving this trend in actually paying anyone for their labor. That the whole point of &quot;AI&quot; is not to create Data the android from The Next Generation, but to avoid having to ever again pay artists, writers, actors, translators, etc, for their work. &quot;I&#39;ll just have a chatbot do it, I&#39;ll just have an image generator do it, I&#39;ll just feed this actor&#39;s voice into my model, I&#39;ll just scan these extras without telling them why so I never have to pay extras again.&quot;<br/><br/>It&#39;s disgusting. The attempt to then copyright the result of feeding their machine *other people&#39;s work* is disgusting.<br/><br/>Moreover: this gives us an opportunity to start regulating so-called AIs. Because on top of being very blatant theft, the rise of chatbots replacing search engines is also *dangerous*. There was a time when you could search online for a cake recipe and be fairly confident that you were going to find a real recipe; nowadays, it&#39;s increasingly dangerous to trust anything you find online, and the tendency of chatbots towards so-called &quot;hallucinations&quot; means we don&#39;t just have to worry that someone on TikTok might be lying to our children about how to make a lime green cake for a &quot;prank&quot;, but also that people who don&#39;t actually know how to cook are going to spread accidental lies by relying on chatbots to generate recipes for them. YouTube is already absolutely filled to brimming with low-effort fake recipe videos, but the logical endpoint of this technology is fake long-form cooking blogs and fake videos of actors we used to trust walking us through fake recipes. You&#39;d trust Gordon Ramsey to tell you how to actually bake a cake, wouldn&#39;t you?<br/><br/>The more popular chatbots get, the more tech evangelists swear they&#39;re the Next Big Thing, the more teachers feel they have to teach kids how to use chatbots in order to prepare them for tomorrow &mdash; the more we are going to see &quot;hallucinations&quot; be accepted fact by the next generation. It will range from harmless hallucinations like lying to users about how many times the letter &quot;n&quot; appears in the word &quot;mayonnaise&quot;, to more dangerous hallucinations like fabricating convincing passages when asked where in the Bible does it condemn being trans (there&#39;s a &quot;Talk to Jesus&quot; bot right now, in fact).<br/><br/>We can put a genuine stop to all of this by simply enforcing copyright law. The expense of having to throw out not just their models but also rendering everything generated with those models uncopyrightable would be huge. The cost of having to retrain everything from scratch would be huge, and companies who have been burned by having to discard or pay royalties on &quot;AI&quot; generated content won&#39;t be so eager to fund the new models.
