As it stands, artificial intelligence relies on being fed and learning from the work of actual, human artists. Whatever script, image, essay, etc is produced by AI is an aggregation of everything its learned from the work it has been fed, therefore making it a crude mash up of the work of hundreds of thousands of artists who pour their life and passion into their work. Allowing copyright on AI generated art and writing is a slap in the face to every single artist whose work was used as a teaching tool for a generative program, not only on an artistic level, but on the very real financial level. On the specific case of entertainment studios using AI to generate movies and TV, if copyright on these produced works is allowed, the studios stand to benefit massively, while leaving the original artists in the dust. I strongly hope that copyright on this kind of work is not allowed to move forward at this time.
