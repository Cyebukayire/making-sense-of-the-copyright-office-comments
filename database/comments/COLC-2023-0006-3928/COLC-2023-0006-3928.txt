As an artist who has published writing and art online, I did not agree to companies crawling the web and using my work to train AI models like OpenAI. I publish work to start conversations and share my thoughts with the world. But with OpenAI, there is no sense of sources or discussion. My words, along with thousands of others, are simply swept up and regurgitated by a machine with no ability to create original thought. And then to think that whatever the algorithm creates is somehow copyrightable is preposterous. While AI has incredible opportunities to change our lives, creating copyrightable art is not one of them. We must apply constraints and guardrails to AI to protect people who have dedicated their lives to creating art.
