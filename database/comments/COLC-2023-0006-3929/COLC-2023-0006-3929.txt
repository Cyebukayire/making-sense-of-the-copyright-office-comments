Copyright is important because it promotes progress. It promotes science. And it protects innovators. Artificial intelligence is a misnomer - it&#39;s actually algorithmic intelligence. It relies upon the work of others to create or produce. It has no sense of ethics. Unregulated, it can be used to plagiarize art or writing. It can - and has - been used to promote racism, sexism, hate and fear - often while plagiarizing the works of others so that they are slandered. It has caused lawsuits to be thrown out of court when lawyers erroneously believed that the cases it provided were real. The one thing it isn&#39;t is intelligent. It requires regulation because it cannot regulate itself. It cannot think for itself. We must think for it, and create regulations that protect our interests. Only then can copyright act as intended.
