Large language model generative AI by definition creates a derivative work based on the corpus of documents it has consumed in its training. In software engineering, for example, training a model on public GitHub repositories is possible. They are public. However each one of those public repositories can and often is accompanied by a license agreement stating the terms under which that source code can be used. Many license agreements require that derivatives must, for example, give credit to them in your derived work. Unless the AI can manage this myriad of individual license agreements and probably show that it produces something that adheres to all of the terms of each of them, it is producing something that is already in violation of intellectual property laws. <br/><br/>Therefore, in conclusion, AI produced content cannot be a copyrightable work. <br/><br/>I am opposed to any move to allow AI generated content to be granted copyright status or any other protection under intellectual property law.
