As the Copyright Office considers the future of art and the digital simulation of skills through generative AI they must understand the genie cannot be put back in the bottle.  This software is not in the exclusive hands of tech giants, it is pervasive and has already begun incorporation into businesses.  The efficiency gains this software provides should not be infringed upon by the federal government except where it can be applied universally.<br/><br/>Software has long existed that provides assistance to artists (copy/paste functions, layers, noise generation for a few examples).  This new technology is much the same.  It -can- be used as a tool to create new works and to speed up the process of that creation.  Utilizing generative AI is a different skill in the same way that utilizing a programing language like Java is a different skill than programming in assembly. (even if your end results are the same)  If artists openly using AI to enhance their work is punished, then only those who covertly use AI to enhance their work will benefit.<br/><br/>If the Copyright Office holds the position that any art created with AI is not copyrightable, how will they determine that it has been created &quot;with AI&quot;?  Multiple times this year already there have been a parade of false positives from both programs and human experts who have proclaimed something to be generated by AI when it factually was not.  Without the ability to identify AI art, any lawmaking would require self-identification; which seems self-defeating if AI art rights are not protected.<br/><br/>Most of the advances in generative AI are happening in open source.  Much of the work that goes into training happens in open source/crowd source communities.  Much like the MP3 issues of the 90s, the software that has produced the problem has propagated past our ability to limit access to it.  Utilizing these programs does not require giant mainframes-many home computers can run many of them.<br/><br/>Finally, as it regards digital replication of artists/actors/musicians, what possible litmus test can be applied?  There are people who have careers as celebrity impersonators...are they allowed to continue to impersonate because they do not use a computer to help?  Is the use of all filters and digitization (auto-tune) forbidden in the creation of art? <br/><br/>Even without AI, there are countless trademark/copyright infringements already in online spaces like Etsy.  The amount of infringement that can be programmatically generated now far outweighs the rate/method of takedown.  If there are new laws, how will artists be able to defend their trademarks/protect their brand/punish infringement in a timely and cost effective manner?  Any system that requires the artist to pursue defense of their copyright will be untenable because of the rate of creation with this technology.<br/><br/>I support artists owning their art and stand in solidarity with the unions who have been threatened by this technology.  The digital world is compromised by this technology in so many ways.  I implore the Copyright Office to be careful about further incentivizing bad/unethical actors to utilize/adopt this technology.
