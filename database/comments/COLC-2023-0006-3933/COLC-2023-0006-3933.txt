I am a software director who sells AI capabilities / consulting services to clients. Despite this I do not think AI generated works should be copyrightable. Human time / creativity / effort should be a bare requirement for copyright protections. AI works could be sufficiently enhanced or worked by a human to meet a requirement for copyright. But a work that was generated entirely by software should not be allowed. <br/><br/>
