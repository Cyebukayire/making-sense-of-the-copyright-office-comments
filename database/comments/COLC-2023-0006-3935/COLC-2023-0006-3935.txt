Hello,<br/><br/>I am a community college Instructor who has struggled with plagiarism since websites like ChatGTP have become available. Many of my students have revealed that they use AI to complete their typed assignments and exams. I understand how appealing this technology is for students who just want to pass a class, but it really does reduce the value of their education. Even worse, many of my students are taking prerequisite courses for healthcare professions, such as medical terminology, pharmacology, and human anatomy and physiology. Failure to understand course concepts, but scoring well well on exams (thanks to AI) puts students, as well as patients, in great danger. I beg of you, please help us find a way to monitor or regulate the way in which students use AI. If all else fails, please put a stop to AI. The future of our students depends on it. Thank you.
