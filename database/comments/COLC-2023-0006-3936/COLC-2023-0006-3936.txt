While there have been some holdouts, and realizations as to how much AI can and cannot actually do. At the current time, most can agree it is changing the online landscape. First, to set the weight of consideration, keep in mind all the trouble that we are having with robocalls and all the misinformation campaigns that simple bots are already running. Wreaking havoc for basic users and administrations alike. Then leaving the complexity of issues down the line, if AI is left free of regulation, unknown, possibly very catastrophic. That is a bit broad for this submission though. The impact that it will have with copyright is also going to be catastrophic though. Already there have been many cases within the art community of works being used to train AI. This is done by the new terms being tacked onto the current user policies in some cases. There needs to be better restrictions of what is deemed as user info collection to allow for site improvement. For if sites cannot be held responsible for user submissions in other ways, it cannot also be claimed that they only own the data when it suits them. This improper use of user creations needs to be treated similarly to when a publisher must get permission to use a song, it needs to be an isolated database from the general site usability. Otherwise these companies could very well be allowed to sidestep even official trademark uses and so on, with the broad reach of it being user data on the site to be used for their own product development. Now for personal opinion: AI has no place in media creation other than for repetitive or basic asset generation. AI being used for creative thought processes serves no benefit to humanity. AI should be kept within the realms of administration, coding, and streamlining the architectural backbone of business; not broaching upon the future thought and prediction that is required for trend appeal and creative works.
