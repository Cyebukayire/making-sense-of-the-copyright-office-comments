I would like to see something to limit copyrighted material from being used to train AI without the copyright holder&rsquo;s free and express consent. AI could be a useful tool, but not if it begins by being trained on stolen content. Artists and writers deserve better than to have their work stolen and made public in AI generators. And companies should not be allowed to require employees or contractors contribute their work or likeness to AI. When we are stressed or scared or tired, we turn to art. Artists deserve to be paid for this comfort they provide.
