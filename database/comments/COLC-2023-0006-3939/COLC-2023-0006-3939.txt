I am strongly against allowing AI generated work to be copyrighted. I am a young writer and artist myself, and I put a great deal of effort into the work I produce. It scares me to think of a future where somebody can write one simple sentence, be provided &quot;artwork&quot; and &quot;writing&quot; that is produced via a machine (often using content that was scraped without the original creators consent), and then be allowed to copyright that. In my opinion, that is not effort - even if a person &quot;trains&quot; an AI.<br/><br/>I want to live in a world where I can make art and have it be appreciated. I believe that allowing the copyright of AI will lead to much harm to independent artists. I&#39;m not a lawmaker. I&#39;m just a 21 year old girl. I can&#39;t try and persuade you using legal arguments. All I can tell you is that I care about the work I create, and it genuinely scares me to think of a future where AI content is seen as commonplace and copyrightable. I humbly ask that you do not allow this future to pass.
