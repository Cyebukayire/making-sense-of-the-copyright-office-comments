AI fundamentally is not creating new material. From a technology perspective, generative AI is essentially dissecting other works and recombining these mixed pieces into a pile of other material. The use of copyrighted works in AI models violates the copyright rights awarded to the copyright owner. AI should be regulated so that its models, prompts, foundational models, and data sources cannot use copyrighted materials without the explicit and informed consent of the copyright holder. Those copyright holders must also be compensated for each use.
