Given that ai can only function by scraping existing material and then using that to piece something together, i do not think anything created by an ai should be protected by copyright. The potential for abuse and infrigment on the intellectual property rights of others is too great otherwise. Inability to claim copyright on ai generated works would also disincentivize companies from performing labor theft by feeding the work of employees to ai and then firing said employees.<br/><br/>There is also the issue of peoples ownership of their own voices, appearances, and artstyles, and how using ai to replicate these things can infringe on that ownership. If someone uses an ai to replicate someones artstyle or voice to create something that promotes beliefs or ideologies the original person does not agree with, they should be able to take some kind of action to have that false use of themselves taken down. Something of this nature created by an ai is different than one created by hand as parody, as the version created by hand has the mark of the parody maker, in the decisions made in the execution, while such decision making is impossible in ai generated content because you cannot influence the creation process, only input what you want and evaluate whats output - the only decision the ai generator makes is what input they use and whether or not they want to try again if the output is unsatisfactory, which is not the same as the mark left by the creator of a parody. Parody is also recognizable as such, while an ai will always strive for straight impersonation - it doesnt understand what parody is.
