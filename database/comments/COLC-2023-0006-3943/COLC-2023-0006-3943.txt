If anybody ought to own things created by an AI, it would be the AI itself that created it, but today&#39;s AIs are not sentient so they can&#39;t count as people in order to own a copyright. Therefore AI-generated content should automatically be in the public domain. <br/>However, if humanity ever builds an AI that is truly sapient and it wants to own its own creations, then we should reconsider the issue at that time.<br/>Either way, people who should NOT have sole rights over AI content are: the person or company who wrote the prompt, or the company that designed the AI.<br/>Also AI content should not be allowed to trespass on human artists&#39; copyright by using non-public-domain works for training the AI without those works&#39; artists&#39; permission.
