Hello, I am a marketing copywriter and creative writer from Michigan, and I am highly concerned with unregulated AI due to threats of copyright and the livelihoods of people like me. With clients, I have already seen them utilize AI instead of copywriters, taking away billable hours, and with the advancement of AI software, it would take away even more jobs. I am also concerned with the lack of human oversight in that I have seen articles be drafted up by AI that are not one-hundred percent accurate, but humans are overlooking it in order to just get things written up quickly and posted. I am aware that AI is here to stay and could certainly help society in many ways, but smart regulation could help make sure we use this great technology more responsibly. There should be a way to protect working creatives as well as strive for greater innovation with AI.
