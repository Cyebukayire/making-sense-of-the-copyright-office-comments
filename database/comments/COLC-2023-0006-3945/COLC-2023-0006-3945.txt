Hello, as a software developer I&#39;m very concerned about the impact unregulated AI could have on my field of work. Already, instances of source code being scraped from open source platforms have been made public. Source code is used to train AI without the developer&#39;s permission or any regards to their intellectual property. The AI trained with this source code often regurgitates the lines of code one by one, even leaving in the original author&#39;s name. As such, AI-generated code cannot be considered intellectual property of its own. I am of the opinion that regulations are direly needed to ensure this technology is used in responsible ways.
