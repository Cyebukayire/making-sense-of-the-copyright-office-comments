Hi there, I genuinely believe we should be using ai and learning algorithms to our advantage but having them take over any kind of creative role is just wrong. This kind of technology could be used to keep track of stock in a store for example not be used to blatantly rip off creative minds for laughs and giggles. Real people have spent their entire lives dedicated to making things worthy of being called art, not to just have some machine come along and warp it. Now I do believe the technology can be used for good it&#39;s just the matter of redirecting focus for it. <br/>Imagine a store that needs no employees as a machine watches consumers pour in and out. It automatically keeps track of who takes what and charges them accordingly, takes care of ordering new stock, and even replacing said stock on the shelf with mechanical arms. Stuff like this is where I believe we should investigating the use of ai. Having this technology replace the human element in art is a slap in the face to anyone who&#39;s doodled a little picture or written a poem, and it can not be used in a way that will uniquely create something new. It only rips multiple sources and jumbled it all together to create.<br/><br/>In short I&#39;m completely against how we&#39;re using ai and learning algorithms currently but I do believe we can use this technology for good.
