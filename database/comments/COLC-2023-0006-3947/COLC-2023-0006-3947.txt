AI threatens to strip away not only human creativity, but the autonomy of many artists, musicians, and writers world wide. By stealing and manipulating our hard work, reducing it to a string of zeros and ones, they also reduce our income, our very livelihood, and in turn threaten our financial stability and in many cases, our mental health as well. We should not have to live in fear that our jobs are at stake, that our way of life is threatened, because of corporations lack of understanding and empathy (as well as their desire to increase profits). I truly hope that our government takes a stand against AI and chooses to protect the common people who have spent years honing their crafts and trying to build a life around the skills they have earned through hours and hours of practice and dedication. AI creations lack integrity and heart, and cannot fit the definition that many consider art to have. Please, please protect us and those who will come after us, ban scraping, regulate corporations use of AI, protect jobs, give us the security we have fought so hard to have. Thank you.
