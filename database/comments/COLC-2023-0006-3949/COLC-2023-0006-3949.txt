Before I begin, I need to state that as the situation currently is? I feel that a few select very rich people see a way to make a LOT of average people lose their means of living and supporting themselves by taking away their jobs and replacing them with AI. I personally feel, as an artist/writer/content creator, that if the regulations come down that AI tools as a whole should be banned from use in copyrightable/commercial works entirely, I am not opposed to that. And optimistically? I would *prefer* it if AI tools were banned from commercial works entirely. But I know that is an extreme, and you all may not be going for that kind of extreme limit. As such, I&#39;ve given my thoughts below on that if AI tools are to be accepted into the world, how they should be used and treated.<br/><br/>I believe that A.I. Generative Tools should not be used as a replacement for a human&#39;s creative endeavors, and a wholesale AI product should not be able to be copyrighted or usable in a copyrightable work. I believe that AI may be able to be used to modify a human artists work ONLY if the human artists consent to their work being modified by AI, and AI *Must Not* be used if trained on data without the explicit consent of the one(s) who created that data in the first place. AI should only be used to assist a person in a creative endeavor and should NOT be used to replace a human entirely. <br/><br/>Example: if a Voice Actor is required for a project, AI must not be used to replace that person by copying their vocals without the Voice Actor&#39;s explicit consent at any time. Each AI use in a specific project must be cleared for a given project with the Voice Actor or their family/estate in the event of their demise.  <br/><br/>Copyright owners Must affirmatively consent (opt in) to the use of their works for training materials. The Training Set *Must* be retained as it was used exactly to show that they are not including copyrighted works they do not have permission for use of in cases of contested copyright. If a copyrighted work is found to be used in violation, it should be removed from the data set. <br/><br/>Q18: To use a Video Game as an example, I believe AI may generate or modify *assets* for a larger copyrightable product in an assistive state, but should not constitute more than 35% of a given end result product. Examples include: Iterating on a series of oil slick textures, or to generate the base image that a human artist will further iterate on for a piece of in-world artwork. All AI data sets used by a production company should be trained on materials willingly provided either by the company&#39;s human artists, or on works sourced from outside the company with explicit written permissions. <br/>Q25: The one who developed the AI Model and did not seek permission from artists is the one at fault. The End Users who used the product assuming it was ethical should not be at fault. <br/>Q28: Yes. AI works should be clearly labeled and identified in credits of some manner, and this should be the responsibility of the person(s) putting the AI work into the public eye. <br/><br/>I currently believe that the situation with AI is such that without regulation, groups such as the AMPTP or companies like Adobe will continue to try to squeeze out human artists so they can use AI to replace the human element. We are already seeing cases of companies ripping off art styles of specific visual artists without consent, or signaling they wish to replace writers and actors with AI generated models to &#39;cut costs.&#39; The use of AI as it currently stands is a naked greed cash grab designed to automate jobs and devalue the human creative endeavors. <br/><br/>A production company *should not* be able to mandate use of AI tools to replace a human in any way, shape, or form, no matter the job. AI tools should only be used by a human artist to assist their own production, willingly, and only in their specific field. A human must NOT be allowed to make the choice to cut out another human of their job by replacing them with AI, and exclusively AI generated works must not be copyrighted. <br/><br/>In the end, we have a situation where many people&#39;s jobs are at stake, and allowing AI works to be copyrightable is poised to make many people lose their jobs, incomes, and very way of life. Automation at this scale with the ongoing lack of consideration of the impact on the average human life is going to change things, and not for the better. I predict that income inequality will skyrocket, homelessness with get worse, and the economy will inevitably collapse.<br/><br/>Please, ensure that AI tools, if they are to be used, are used ethically and with concern for the average working person&#39;s livelihood.
