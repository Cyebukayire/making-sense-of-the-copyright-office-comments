Copyright is not only a moral question, it&#39;s an economic one. Workers rely on the financial benefits of copyright to support themselves and their families and to participate in the economy. While I believe there is a moral argument to be had, the economic argument is, I imagine, the one that will win the most support. Artificial Intelligence programs are trained on copyrighted works, often without the consent of the copyright holder or compensation paid to them. While I suppose it&#39;s debatable whether this violates copyright law, it does completely undermine the economics of creative work. That would disrupt the economy as a whole. If we dismantle an economic system currently supporting people&#39;s livelihoods, we have to have a meaningful income replacement. We have no such plan in place in the United States, and thus the economic fallout would likely have both immediate and long-term impacts on American workers and the American economy. Therefore I support legislation that would prohibit tech companies or AI creators from training AI on copyrighted work without obtaining consent from the copyright holder and paying for the use of their work. I also support legislation that would prevent any work that is generated or partly generated by AI from receiving a copyright.
