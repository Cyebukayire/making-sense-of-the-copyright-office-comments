AI is not required to keep innovation moving. Humans have always come up with incredible ideas, and AI just copies human thought. AI will destroy art because it is not able to be original without taking from what humans have already created. As a creator I would be remiss if I was no longer able to be paid for the hard work I do because my work has been put against my will into AI to be taken away and then copyrighted. AI should not be able to be copyrighted, as it is already taking from what other people have created, so it will never be AI original work.
