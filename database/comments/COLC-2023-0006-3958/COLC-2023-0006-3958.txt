I am of the opinion that legal decisions so far made finding that AI generated work cannot be copyright due to lack of human creator are entirely correct. However, I feel there is a distinct need to create tightened legislation and regulation to further protect genuine human created content and clarify the AI component. I feel that it should also be clear that no slap dash human editing merits AI work to be recognised as copyright protected. That there must be an absolute minimum of 60% generated human development for something to be even considered for the possibility of copyright, and even then, there should be legally defined wording so that it isn&#39;t just marginally changed, edited, or overseen by human directorship to allow this to be merited.<br/>I also feel more should be done to address the blatent theft of human content creation that has allowed AI generated work like ChatGPT and img2go etc to function in the first place. Even on the rare occasions that data aggregation for AI development has been entirely legally obtained, or gathered with explicit permission, can the content be considered original work to be copyrighted? I say no. When a human generates content like art, design, written work, music, photography, or anything then there is generally a significant amount of genuine creation and originality and perspective involved, though even then, there are protections to define plagiarism and fraud to put parameters around such work. Current AI is not actually &quot;intelligence&quot; but a well coded data aggregation tool which can deliver content. But it is not true creation, just permutations presented in the best possible manner defined by coded parameters, which, often due to non-consenusual use of materials like image/written sources/online books/music sampling/ data mining can produce &quot;wrong&quot; output like six fingered figured people in &quot;AI art&quot; or gibberish. To me, this is proof of the danger of &quot;AI&quot;. It is not intelligent, does not have &quot;thinking&quot; capability, and cannot be considered able to &quot;create&quot;. It should not be permissible to copyright AI produced work, and should be strictly monitored for &quot;stolen&quot; material used to generate content.
