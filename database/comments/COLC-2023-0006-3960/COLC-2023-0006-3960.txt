Hi there, I am a writer and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and many content creators&#39; livelihoods.<br/><br/>AI technology has already been damaging to many creators due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse, which has led to loss of income for many creators, due to AI copying their techniques or reproducing them wholesale. This is not only wholly unfair but will lead to creative stagnation and demotivation of creators to produce work, which would have much wider cultural and social impact across the world. Protections for copyright should be in place, following the model of music copyright, where use is regulated and content creators will still be credited and paid for any use of their work. Unregulated AI in its current form is theft and plagiarism.
