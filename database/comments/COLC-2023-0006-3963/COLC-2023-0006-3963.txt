AI is theft. Plain and simple, a machine that must steal content from real humans in order to learn or function has no &#39;originality&#39; to it, period. It&#39;s fundamentally impossible. I, as a writer, would be incandescently angry knowing that all my hard earned work was stolen and regurgitated by a machine for someone else to sell and profit off of. My lived experiences, my emotions, my pains and hopes and dreams, bastardized and ruined - and for what? Someone to churn out something they didn&#39;t put any effort into, didn&#39;t create themselves, to make a quick buck off of? <br/>AI art and AI generated writing would destroy artists, and what it means to be human and to share art created from our own hearts and minds. Artists like me already struggle to be paid what we&#39;re worth, already struggle to break into an industry that is somehow so coveted yet so disrespected that it&#39;s seen as a &#39;lesser, risky degree&#39; to take in school, AI would not only make that even more difficult, but make it almost impossible. <br/>If it is illegal for someone to use copyrighted material without consent, it should be illegal for AI to learn from it, to use it, and to profit from it.
