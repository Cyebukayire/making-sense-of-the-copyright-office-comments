I&rsquo;m an artist who wants to make a living (partially or fully) doing my work. It takes time and effort to not only make art but also to study and learn from it. To see that hard work and effort being scraped and used by people who do not have the consent of artists and rake in immense profit without paying us back is infuriating. Not to mention the use of peoples (i.e. voice actors and performers) bodies and voices without their consent. That is an unconscionable act that shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed in any society. AI becoming more and more widespread is making those working in the creative field (aside from the CEOs) poorer with layoffs and the lack of regulation and protection will further hold back the already stagnant art culture we have today.
