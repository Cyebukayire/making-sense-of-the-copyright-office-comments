Forgive the lack of formatting, I am just going to write statements about AI and copyright. <br/>I believe there is legal precedent that you cannot copyright work which has been produced with generative programs and I love that being a solid rule. <br/>Most larger generative programs have crawled the internet sampling many works which they did not have permission to, and rather than try to tease out which systems are ethical, there should just be strict restrictions on profiting from generated media in areas like journalism and advertising. You did not come up with that, nor did you come up with the content on which you trained your system.<br/>I think corporations should be required to disclose when media utilizes over a certain percentage of generated content, and there should be more explicit disclosures of when websites are feeding your data to robots.<br/>Movie producers SHOULD NOT be allowed to recreate an actor&#39;s likeness for background acting and only pay them one day rate for image/motion capture. I don&#39;t think they should do it at all, it&#39;s lazy and out of touch movie making, but if they must do it, actors must be compensated fairly for continued use of their likeness.
