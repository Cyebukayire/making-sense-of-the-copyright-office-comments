The issue comes down to media being used without the knowledge or consent of its original creator; often times to gain profit off of another creators media. It is detrimental to to the industry as it makes artists less confident in promoting their media in public(in fear of it being stolen) and it takes sales/profits away from many individuals, consolidating them into a few companies. There have been example of AI learning being used successfully in Animation, Game design, and in medicine. The core deference we see with these examples is that they have license to use the material the AI was learning from or they created it specifically for it. Many of the publicly and commercially available ai image generators do not have licensing permission for the art that they are learning from and/or use user uploaded media without confirming that said user has permission to use the art.
