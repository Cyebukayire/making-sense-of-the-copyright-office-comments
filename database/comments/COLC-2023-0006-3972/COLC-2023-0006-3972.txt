I do not believe that AI should be able to be trained on works that are under copyright. Additionally, works created by AI should not be able to be copyrighted. The constitution instituted copyright &quot;To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.&rdquo; Providing copyright to works created by AI or allowing AI to mass create materials will stifle progress and artistic creation by artists, which is exactly opposite the clear intent and language provided by the constitution in the provision of copyright. Mass creation of works by machines does not require artistic intent or creativity, but will compete with artists writers. Mass scraping of copyrighted works allows companies to profit off of these artists in a way that has not existed before, once again in the exact opposite way that copyright is described in the constitution. <br/><br/>I do not believe that machines are capable of creating art because they lack artistic creativity, and they will destroy the progress of artists as prescribed in the constitution.
