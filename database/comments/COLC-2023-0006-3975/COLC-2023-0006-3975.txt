Thank you for taking on this important issue. Artists of all kinds need protection from AI, Machine Learning, and Generative AI output models. Its not enough to for the legal framework just to say AI generated images can&#39;t be copy-written. We must protect artists from being replaced and from being paid less to modify AI gen images just enough to qualify for copyright. AI systems are built from scarping large amounts of data including copyright protected works into its system model to spit out images. These models cannot generate with out the data. Even with consent and compensation with AI is a slippery slope. We&#39;ve seen musical artists paid pennies per stream and we have a chance to correct that system with new copyright laws protecting artists from AI doing the same. I think it is worth looking at work for hire laws as well. Companies are able to own artists work entirely even if compensated fairly, often results in abuse or wage/compensation being pushed down over time. Tech has not delivered a bright future and has instead divided and stolen from Americans everywhere. While laws and regulations lag behind. Let&#39;s not allow that to happen with AI. Please protect artists of all kinds from AI theif and degradation of craft. Thank you for your time.
