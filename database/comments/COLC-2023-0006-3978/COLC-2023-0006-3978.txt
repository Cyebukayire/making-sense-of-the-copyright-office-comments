The intent of copyright is to protect human creativity.  AI is not human and things is generates cannot be considered human.  Furthermore many of these model infringe on other copyrighted material.  I found out myself recently as I queried chatGPT.  We should NOT allow AI generated content and the models created should have to get proper copyrights for all materials they use for training.
