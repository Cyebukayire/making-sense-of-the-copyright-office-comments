AI art is a just blend of other people&#39;s concepts fed to an algorithm in order to create something from it, it cannot create something new on it&#39;s own, just blend it with others ideas, this is what makes many AI art out there being easily traceable into it&#39;s origin, where anyone can tell that the original artist was straight up plagiarized. Most of these algorithms are fed without the artists consent by anonymous internet sources, although there are some sites like DeviantArt who allows the creator to permit their work to be used for AI art, those are not the majority of cases, many being taken from other websites where that option is not available so the artists can not have a voice on that subject, such as Twitter, Reddit or Tumblr. This pastiche of artworks is essentially stealing from non-AI artists alone, because the AI Art results are not advanced enough to feed it&#39;s own algorithm, it lives and thrives off stolen artwork, without a human artists, the AI is nothing, and this is done without consent, or even knowledge of the artists themselves.
