Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment. <br/><br/>I&#39;m a writer whose livelihood is threatened by the use of language learning models to produce articles. I earn a living by monetizing my skill and creativity. These AI models can train on my writing and produce articles without my knowledge or consent or any compensation for my work. While a work is under copyright, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI. To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.<br/><br/>Artists and writers should give consent and receive compensation to be included in a training set, and images and writing resulting from AI should not be eligible for copyright without significant further human manipulation/improvement of the generated image. In addition, articles or images resulting from AI should indicate that clearly upon publication. The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.
