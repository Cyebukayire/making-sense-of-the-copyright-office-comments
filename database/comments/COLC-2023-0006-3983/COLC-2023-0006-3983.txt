Artificial intelligence programs scrape the internet for already existing material (which does include copyrighted materials), and often without the consent of the owners of the original material being aware. Any &quot;art&quot; that is the product of Artificial Intelligence should not be eligible for copyright because Artificial Intelligence is incapable of producing original materials and can only produce a mixture of the things it has already consumed.<br/>This means that stories made by A.I. are essentially plagiarized, as are any other forms of &quot;A.I. art&quot;.<br/>I have used an A.I. story writer in the past and one thing many people also used it noticed was that it would sometimes lift entire sentences from already existing works.<br/>If plagiarism is not acceptable, then A.I. &quot;art&quot; should not be accepted either.
