Hello. I am Andrew Anderson, a citizen of Los Angeles, California.<br/><br/>AI-generated material can not and should not be copyrighted even without a human involved. That in itself violates copyright. <br/><br/>You cannot copyright AI-generated material in general, regardless of whether or not there was a human involved; <br/><br/>Copyright liability needs to simply ban AI tools and models.<br/><br/>Publicity rights must also be protected from AI tools and models.<br/><br/>AI tools and models steal from artists/creators, and do not protect copyright for any person who needs copyright protection.<br/><br/>Thank you for you time.<br/><br/>
