I am a writer and actor, and fear what AI will do to not only my own creations, but the content created by artists that I love. AI currently scrapes the world wide web, taking in material that is copyrighted but those content creators are not paid for it. I believe that there must be protection for content creators, who are human beings, and that AI cannot make anything that can be copyrighted by definition, because they are only scraping and plagiarizing. Corporations will use this to their benefit to exploit workers further, as we are already seeing demonstrated by the studios in their fight with the WGA and SAG. Please keep protects for human beings who are content creators and deserve to have their work protected and let AI simply be a tool that people (human beings) can USE to improve the world.
