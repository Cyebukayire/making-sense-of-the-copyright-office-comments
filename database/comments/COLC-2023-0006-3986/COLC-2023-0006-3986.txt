I am an academic with generally a VERY broad sense of what should be free use and in the public domain. I believe in the power of transformative works and inspiration. That is not what is happening here. So-called &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is not transforming anything. It is stealing, rearranging the stolen goods, and hoping no one will notice, all for corporate profit. There are ethical ways to approach these issues, and those ways are not the ways that the bodies developing these models have taken. Until such time as more ethically sound models exist, there is no way to give copyright protection to artificially generated text that is not essentially sanctioning theft. Individuals whose works have been used as training models deserve compensation.
