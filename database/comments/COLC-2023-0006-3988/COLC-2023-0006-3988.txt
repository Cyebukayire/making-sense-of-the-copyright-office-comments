As an author and artist, the use of AI in my fields of work is a matter or great concern. Currently as it stands, AI scrapes the internet for content to produce its output without proper compensation, permission, or any sort of licensing or copyright terms from the original creators. Not only should this be illegal under copyright law, it is immoral. There are uses of AI that are legitimate and useful to streamline and enhance creative work, but it must be done with compensation and consent from the content creators that the AI is learning from. Until that is the case, using AI to create and sell &ldquo;new&rdquo; works for profit while the creators who&rsquo;s work has been stolen and used should be illegal and punishable by law. Artists and writers impacted by the unintended use of their work deserve to be compensated fairly, and to have the ability to protect their work from misuse.
