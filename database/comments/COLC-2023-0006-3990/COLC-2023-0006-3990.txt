I am a lawyer who has been practicing Copyright Law for 19 years.  I recently earned my Master of Laws degree in Internet Law and Policy.  My thesis included an in-depth discussion on where AI fits into copyright legislation, as it pertains to ownership and infringement.  The thesis has been published in UCLA&#39;s &quot;Journal of Law and Technology&quot; in their Winter 2023 issue.<br/><br/>A section in my thesis is dedicated to proposing accountability and transparency in AI-generated works in copyright law (Part III, Sec. D).  Further, a section discusses litigation, enforcement of copyright laws, and other dispute resolution avenues (Part VI).<br/><br/>While the thesis addresses copyright issues from the American legislative perspective, it also gives consideration to the state of the law in Canada, and references laws in other countries.  This global perspective is important, considering that AI applications are not limited to American boundaries, and that foreign initiatives can impact U.S. citizens, businesses, politics, and legislation.
