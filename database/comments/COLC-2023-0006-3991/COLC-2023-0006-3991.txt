AI art simply CAN NOT be copywritten because of how it&#39;s made. it takes already-existing, most likely copywritten works and mashes them through a computer with zero human input into the decision-making aspects of creating the image. A human did not add anything transformative to the resulting image, ergo it should not be considered transformative. Looking a few years into the future: if someone took a patented design for a car and ran it through the same technology and got a worse car out of it, it would be dangerous and stupid. By allowing AI &quot;art&quot; to be copywritten by people with zero care for the process of art or basic ethics, a precedent is set for AI being used for things that might have a direct impact on people&#39;s physical well-being. Right now it&#39;s easy enough to ignore artists because they lack the means to legally fight this, but will you be able to ignore shysters in the future trying to patent AI generated hip replacements or dialysis machines for a quick buck? Will you be able to ignore the owners of the original patents that got fed through the AI in the first place when they&#39;ve actually got the ability and money to fight back? I strongly urge the regulatory powers that be to head this off at the pass before anyone gets hurt.
