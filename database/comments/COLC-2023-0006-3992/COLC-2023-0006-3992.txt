I am a college student an upcoming dp. I work on films and advertisements. I believe that we need a full ban of AI technologies In artistic spaces. If content becomes fully automated it will not be interesting anymore. New ideas will not be shared, just regurgitated formulas. Not to mention the issue regarding workers. I personally believe If a human did not create it, it is not art. And to see screenwriters and editors fear that they might loose their job is just the beginning.
