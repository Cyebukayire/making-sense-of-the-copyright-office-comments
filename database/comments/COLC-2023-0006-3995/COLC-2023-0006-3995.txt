Ai creations should not be able to carry copyright. As they are amalgamation of algorithm and not a creation of the individual, carrying protection for copyright opens up too many questions - for example, can the individual random generation of a random number generator be copywrit?<br/><br/>Additionally, most generation software uses nonconsentual datasets to form its algorythms, and that should not be allowed. In order to be used in an AI dataset, direct and explicit consent should be obtained by the copyright holder - or it should not be allowed.
