I&#39;ve seen tons of Visual Artists who&#39;ve trained for years to develop and Original Style and voice that is their Livelihood.  And their life&#39;s work us used without their Consent to train a AI to replace them. Think of talent and Experience like a pension fund that the artist paid their dues of Hard Work for years into into a Pension fund only to have a Company just take all of it for their own bonus.  AI is unearned experience and unlearned talent that is sold for profit by Billionaire Tech Companies.  Any and Every President&#39;s administration from now on will have increasingly bad unemployment numbers as AI will only grow and replace workers in every sector.
