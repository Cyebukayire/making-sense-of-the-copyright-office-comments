Artificial Intelligence is already taking good paying jobs from writers and artists in several different fields, and it is doing so based on skills it learned from our work, uncompensated. <br/><br/>AI is not a human. Work generated from AI should not be able to be copyrighted, as it is essentially plagiarized. For the sake of our future, HUMAN creativity and ingenuity needs to be protected, now. Art and storytelling have always been the backbone of human civilization. Do not allow it to be taken from the hands of your citizens and monopolized by a handful of wealthy corporations.
