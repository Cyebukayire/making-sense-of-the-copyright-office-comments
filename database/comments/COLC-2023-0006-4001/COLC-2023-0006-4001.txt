Thank you for taking the time to accept comments on this divisive topic,<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m an artist by trade. I&rsquo;ve gone through years of training, took on student loans, and graduated top of my class in art fields. After graduating I suffered years of poverty at low wage jobs while continuing to practice my skills. Finally 3 years ago I landed my first big job doing art for slot machines and for the first time in my life I have financial stability. <br/><br/>Art is an incredibly specialized skill that takes years to master. The job market was fiercely competitive even before the invention of generative ai. I can&rsquo;t speak for every professional artist but art is my one employable skill. All my eggs are in this basket. If my artwork can be easily replaced with images generated by ai tools I worry about my livelihood for the rest of my life. <br/><br/>That being said I do understand that generative ai exists now and have familiarized myself with the tools. With a prompt and a button click, this tool can create an image in seconds that would take a skilled craftsperson dozens, maybe even hundred, of hours. It&rsquo;s incredibly powerful. <br/><br/>It has the potential to become a tool in an artist&rsquo;s toolbelt, or replace human artists entirely with the tool. Perhaps even both if it enables a single artist to do the work of 5, causing 4 people to lose their jobs to an exponentially more competitive market.<br/><br/>I don&rsquo;t know the way forward. What I do know is that nonconsensually using copyrighted artwork and photography to train the tool that makes them obsolete is exploitative and should be illegal. <br/>Human artists and photographers should have the power to sell or donate their artwork to ai generators if they choose.<br/><br/>If ai generators use ethically sourced images (sold or donated by the copyright holder) then I have no qualm with non-commercial use of ai images. This opens up avenues for people to tell stories, communicate ideas, and have fun with the tool. Generating ai images is fun! You type in a few words and it spits out something approximating what you asked for. You can resubmit the prompt a dozen times and get a dozen different results. It&rsquo;s a fantastic toy. <br/><br/>But even in the case of ethically sourced ai generators I believe significant human intervention should be required for commercial work. This should be a tool in the toolbelt of human artists, not something used to replace them.<br/><br/>Image generators are incredibly consequential and I appreciate you treating them with the deliberation they deserves. <br/>Thank you for your time. <br/>
