I strongly believe that the products of so-called &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; programmes (in reality, generative algorithms running on statistical models) should NOT be eligible for copyright protection. This is because the vast majority of these models are trained on data sets obtained without the consent of the makers, often on previously copyrighted material, and it has been shown that it is very possible for such a generative programme to (unintentionally) exactly reproduce aspects of those pre-existing works, thereby constituting plagiarism and theft of intellectual property. Furthermore, I believe that the intent of copyright law should be to protect against the unjust exploitation of human creativity and ingenuity, and the products of these generative algorithms should therefore NOT be eligible for such, as they inherently lack human creativity or ingenuity in their conception and execution.
