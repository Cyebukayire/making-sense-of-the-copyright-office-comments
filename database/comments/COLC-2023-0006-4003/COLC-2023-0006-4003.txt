I will keep this very short, Most AI is trained on derivative work, that other people either posted for free for others to see and use or Agreed to terms to help Train these AI. This means that all the information the AI uses to generate any kind of work be it art or some Programming style is based mostly on other people&rsquo;s own freely available work. So, this type of AI generated work should not be Copy-writable. However, in the case where the AI is only generating data from itself, running new tests and seeing the results and attempting to make small changes to see what those changes do and outputting it. These I believe could be Copy-writable if it did not start off using derivative work to train the AI.
