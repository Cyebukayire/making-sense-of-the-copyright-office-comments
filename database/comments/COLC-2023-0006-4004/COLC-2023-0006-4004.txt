I am not a fan of how AI is currently trained. Companies have scraped massive amounts of data (some of it extremely sensitive like medical files) and the people who actually made the work get no sort of compensation or ability to consent. I also believe that companies such as Adobe are using the current moral panic to push laws and regulations that benefit groups like them to the harm of the everyday person. I want lawmakers and their aides to research the issue throughly before passing any laws.
