I worry about ai being made using works that they do not have the rights to. I think it is acceptable for generative ai to exist as long as it was only trained using data that the creators had full rights to use. Otherwise, if an ai model uses data, such as art or writing, created by other people not making the ai and who did not give permission for their works to be used, then it should not be allowed.
