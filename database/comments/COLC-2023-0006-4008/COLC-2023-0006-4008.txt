AI should NOT be allowed to directly copyright, nor should any work where AI was used in co-authorship be allowed to copyright said work. All works in which AI is used to manipulate text, images, programmatic code, summaries of works, etc should be copyleft, and any derivates of those copyleft items should be considered to be co-authored by AI and be ineligible for copyright. <br/><br/>The point of copyright law is that humans should benefit from their works. <br/>
