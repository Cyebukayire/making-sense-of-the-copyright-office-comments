AI, in its current form, is a threat to the income of every single creative in the industry and beyond. It cannot create without being fed data of countless artists, taken without their consent, to produce cheap imitations without any form of compensation to those affected by it. Without any safeguards for said artists, it&#39;ll continue to put many people out of a job and close off many opportunities for innovation. I do not with for my own artwork to be used to feed any AI training models, nor will I ever consent to my intellectual property(s) being stolen and imitated by people who have no appreciation for the labor I, or anyone else, puts into a creative work.
