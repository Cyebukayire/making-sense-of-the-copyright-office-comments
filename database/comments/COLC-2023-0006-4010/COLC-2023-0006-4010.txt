Thank you for opening this issue up to public comment. As an artist who shares my work online, AI online scraping is a major concern. I do not give consent to allow AI databases to use my art but I currently have no way to enforce that. My work is solely my property under copyright law during the set period after I create it. To add it to AI databases without my consent is theft and should be prosecutable under copyright law. There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.&nbsp; While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.&nbsp; To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies. I appreciate that you took the time to read my comment.
