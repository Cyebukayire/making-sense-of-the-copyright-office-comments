My name is Rachel Shukert, I&rsquo;m a writer and producer of film and television. It is my belief that AI will be vastly detrimental to my field, cheaply regurgitating proprietary ideas, putting thousands of writes, actors, crew members, editors and VFX artists out of work or below a living wage, and irrevocably damaging to the great US entertainment industry, except for the few upper level executives who will be able to line their own pockets from making an inferior product and eventually selling what&rsquo;s left of the companies for parts. Please ban or deeply regulate its use and disallow AI authored works from copyright and prohibit the training of large language models on existing work. Thank you.
