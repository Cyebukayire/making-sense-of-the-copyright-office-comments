The &quot;AI technology&quot; we have today is fed information and can only alter that information, blending aspects of what was in those original works. As the &quot;AI&quot; we have in 2023, the term is incorrectly interpreted to be the assumption of individuality. Until a truly independent learning AI (such as the robot citizen Sophia or her future kind), there can NOT be any copyright on AI generated &quot;assets&quot;. A copyright belongs to the original creator of the piece, and claiming that a corporation or individual can profit from inherently stolen work is utterly blasphemous. For consideration; an individual will be kicked out of a college entirely if they have attempted to submit work generated from an AI word processing service for &quot;plagiarism&quot;. If that holds up, then obviously anything coming from a program designed to blend information together CAN NOT be copyrighted.
