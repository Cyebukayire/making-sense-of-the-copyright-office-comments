I am an award-winning actor and the author of a NYTimes bestselling memoir published by Random House. My book has a copyright. That should mean something. I am also a member in good standing for over 40 years of the actors unions: SAG AFTRA and Actors Equity. SAG AFTRA, alongside the WGA, are on strike. One of the major issues is to place limits NOW on AI in the creative entertainment world.  I consider the use of my book and my other published writing, as well as my physical likeness by AI, the programmers of AI who feed it &quot;content&quot;, and the companies who have developed AI and now monetize it to be theft. The US Copyright Office should be fighting along with the creative guilds to place firm restrictions NOW on the monetized use of AI. Both Eric Schmidt of ex of Google and Geoffrey Hinton, the &quot;godfather&quot; of AI, have warned against its dangers and urged a plan for immediate control. Listen to them. <br/>
