As a writer, I have found out that some of my writing has likely been used, without my consent or any acknowledgment, to train AI. These claims were denied until certain verbage made it clear that stories were being scraped without notice or permission. This is tantamount to theft, and I&#39;ve since had to take measures to protect my works. Artists have had to do the same, applying techniques to their own works that render AI scraping impossible. Even then, AI coders and creators can find ways around such failsafes, again without any permission or notice given to the owner of the works. Unregulated AI has endangered many livelihoods and technology that should have been celebrated is eyed with suspicion and hatred by many who have had their works stolen.
