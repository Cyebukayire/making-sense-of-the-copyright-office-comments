The use of A.I. in any creative process has proven, time and again, to be a fancy means of data theft. Works using A.I. should be totally ineligible for trademark or copyright. Thus far, not a single A.I. dataset, even those touted as &quot;ethically sourced&quot; has been without stolen works or stolen data. Companies use these datasets, built off of stolen work, to compete with the individuals they&#39;ve stolen from in their own fields. To legitimize this theft would be the same as legitimating car thieves who sell cars to compete with legitimate dealerships. It would be the same as legitimizing back-alley tooth snatchers as &quot;dentists&quot; on par with real dental practices. Both the selling of cars and working on teeth is regulated for many reasons, including for the protection of those working in those fields and the consumers. With A.I., both the consumers and industry professionals are turned into the product, without their consent or understanding, through rampant data theft. Stolen artworks, animations, and voices are only the surface level of what these algorithms can steal and impersonate.<br/><br/>The use of A.I. to impersonate real, living individuals also poses serious threats to personal safety, and could even be readily used as propaganda, misinformation, and political sabotage to a degree we haven&#39;t yet seen.
