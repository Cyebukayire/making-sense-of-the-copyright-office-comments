AI continuously uses the original work of others without their consent. When producing content, AI regurgitates this original, protected content once again without the consent of the creator. This sucks so goddamn bad. Protect artists, because AI is sure as shit harming all different kinds of creators right now. It doesn&rsquo;t create anything new&mdash;it just steals from thousands of artists who didn&rsquo;t sign up for this shit.
