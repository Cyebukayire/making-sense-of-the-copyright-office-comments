As a graphic designer, I make my living off of the art I create. It is a skill I worked very hard to develop in both school and in my professional career. The threat AI poses is constantly looming over me. When AI generated &quot;art&quot; is created, it uses a series of prompts from the user, then searches the internet for images which it splices up and uses to generate a &quot;new&quot; image. The images that are used in this process are copyrighted to their original owners, who have absolutely no way of preventing their work from being used. The AI searches indiscriminately and there is no legal way for an artist to protect their intellectual property from it. If you look at several AI generated images, you may notice strange squiggles at the bottom corner of some of the images. Those squiggles are the mangled remains of a signature from someone&#39;s original artwork. That artist did not give permission for their signature or any part of their work to be used, but you&#39;ll still see its remains in the AI generated image. Currently, AI is simply a legal form of art theft. If an artist sees their work being sold without their permission, they may issue a DMCA take down request to have their work removed. In the case of AI art, such a request is not possible and artists are powerless to do anything but sit and watch their hard work be profited off of by someone who simply typed a few key words into a computer program.
