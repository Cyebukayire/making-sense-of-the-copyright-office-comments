I am very wary about the use of AI and how it could impact those whose work is being used to generate something &ldquo;new&rdquo; by AI.  While I have used AI (chat gpt) to generate handouts for my clients on how to care for their lizard (I am an exotic animal veterinarian), I do not think infringes on anything copyrighted or that I am taking money/business from someone while doing so.  People who make a living making art, writing short stories, novels, movies etc would theoretically be harmed.  As far as I understand, a lot of AI tools scrape the internet (or whatever database) and pull information from that to generate something new.  That includes copyrighted material and could impact those original copyright holders.  <br/><br/>It just seems like we have not done enough to know how this will impact people&rsquo;s livelihood and could have much more of a negative impact that we can not yet see.  I don&rsquo;t have an answer&hellip;but I do not want us/the US/people to dive headfirst into AI generated &ldquo;everything&rdquo; without way more information.
