Machine learning &quot;AI&quot; is inherently different from human learned artists. We cannot allow &quot;AI&quot; companies to profit off the work of tens of thousands of artists by violating their copyrights. None of these artists have consented to have their work plugged into an algorithm that utilizes the potentially decades of work they have put into developing their skills. This is the same for musicians and actors as well. &quot;AI&quot; programs need to be legally required to display the weighted average of the images that contribute to any given output, sorted by the largest influence so that artists can identify if their copyright is being infringed on or not. &quot;AI&quot; companies need to be restricted from data scraping the internet to mass infringe on artists work without their consent as well. Protect real humans. Do not support blatant plagiarism.
