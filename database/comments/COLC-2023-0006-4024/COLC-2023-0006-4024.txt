Regarding question 15 about Transparency and Recordkeeping, AI models require the use of datasets in order to generate results. These datasets are frequently comprised of pre-existing human works (which themselves are built through skills and labor that are unique to the individuals who created them). In the same way that film, television, photography, and other creative fields require credit attribution for work involved in the production of a larger product (ex a television series with actor/actress credits, an animated series that credits individual background painters, writers for films that have had dramatic and ongoing script changes throughout their productions), developers of AI models should be required to maintain and publicly disclose the entirety of their datasets as a means of providing credit for the works that are directly being used. This would fall in line with how attribution is typically handled in similar fields. Regarding question 18 discussing copyrightability, there are two key points. Firstly, generative AI cannot function the way it does without a pre-existing set of data. Secondly, copyright law does not protect the listing of product ingredients or contents, and that is fundamentally the extent of the human involvement of the generative AI process. Inputting a series of terms into a tool that filters references from a pool of data into a result is not creative expression.
