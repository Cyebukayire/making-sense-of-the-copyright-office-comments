I am an actor and in these times of difficulty finding work, producers are wanting to take my job away by paying me once and using an image they can manipulate to make a movie or video.  The producers are also wanting to remove writers, set workers who build and light the scene you see, caterers, drivers, and more, even remove the stages from the location.  It is tough enough finding meaningful work as an Actor, that we have to fight for better wages, Now we have to fight for our jobs to keep people working instead of computers.
