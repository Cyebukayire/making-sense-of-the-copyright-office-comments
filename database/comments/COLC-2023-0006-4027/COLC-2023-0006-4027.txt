Regarding the two questions under discussion:<br/><br/>The first, whether an A.I. generated work can be copyrighted, has an easy answer in existing law: Derivative Works. If a creation could be considered a derivative work, derived from an A.I. created work, it can be copyrighted. Otherwise it cannot. Since A.I. created works are not copyrightable, the laws are identical to those of works dervived from public domain works. This has the merits of being simple, grounded in existing law, and flexible should the definition of Derivative Works also change.<br/><br/>The second, whether copyrighted works can be used in training data, is more complicated. It is not infringing for a human to study the works of other creators in order to learn and imitate their style, so that much should be protected.<br/><br/>It is also not infringing for a human to view copyrighted images, text, etc. on a website, even though web browsers download that content so the human can view them. This is a contradiction in existing law: it is technically illegal to do the very thing that web browsers are designed to do, and that literally billions of people do every day. For laws governing computers downloading copyrighted works for A.I. training purposes to be consistent with existing law, existing law needs to be updated to describe actual practice.<br/><br/>As things stand, this behavior, when performed by humans, is loosely considered to be covered under an &quot;implied license&quot; argument. It is assumed that a copyright holder understands how computers and the internet work, and agrees to their works being downloaded for the purpose of being viewed in a web browser. However, this interpretation has not been tested in court. Because A.I. training is a new phenomenon, it can be argued that this &quot;implied license&quot; does not extend to this purpose, but this argument is weak because it is based on untested law.<br/><br/>The first step, then, is to codify how normal browsing behavior is legal, without relying on untested, implied interpretations of existing law. The legality of A.I. training will follow, in part, from that decision.
