AI models should have the same access to copyrighted materials as humans do. Everything that is considered fair use for a human should be fair use for an AI model. If a human author or artist can create work inspired by other authors/artists, then AI should be able to do the same. <br/>AI generated content should not be copyrightable. Copyright exists to protect human authors and let them benefit from their labor. AI doesn&#39;t generate original content - only derivative from other work. AI is a tool and not a creator. An author would be the person who created the prompt that got AI model to generate the content, and the prompt could be copyrighted. Companies that build AI models shouldn&#39;t have rights to the content produce, same as the company that made the chisel an artist used to make a statue have copyright to the statue.
