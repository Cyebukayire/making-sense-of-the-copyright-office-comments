While advancements and implementation of AI technology are inevitable, we must ensure that such is tightly regulated so as to protect the interests of the general public.  Much of what is being proposed now serves only to destroy jobs and to generate unlimited revenue for IP holders at the expense of the creatives whose work was used to build and train the generative AI models.  The current strikes by the writers and actors guilds are proof of this: studios want to offload as much work as they can to generative AI, exploiting loopholes in contracts (or enshrining these loopholes as standardized practices) so as to pay people as little as possible while still demanding difficult, specialized work.  Many actors&#39; contracts now require granting the studio unlimited license to use their image to train 3D modeling tools, granting the actors little-if-any compensation or rights use to their own image.  In both cases the negative consequences of these developments are beyond our imagination: the immediate ramifications are horrifying, and only time will tell what deplorable methods executives and rights holders will invent as the technology matures.<br/><br/>Culturally, generative AI is by its very definition derivative: it analyzes its data set in order to create new combinations of already-existing ideas, rather than making new actual ideas.  It will result in more generic, bland content, without actually adding anything new to human culture.<br/><br/>If AI is used to replace human labor on a massive scale, which seems to be the likely trajectory, then this will result in an absolutely seismic change in society.  Even if the current levels of human labor are no longer needed, people still have necessary expenses for shelter, food, education, and medicine; to slash incomes without addressing these needs will cause untold harm to billions of people.  A stiff tax on businesses that employ AI to reduce human labor, the proceeds from which go to fund social safety net programs with 100% universal access, could mitigate harm, or potentially even improve general quality of life.
