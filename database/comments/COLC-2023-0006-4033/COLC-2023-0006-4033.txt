I am a young writer and I am worried that my work may be used for AI research. I don&rsquo;t want my work to be used for that at all and it&rsquo;s scares me that it might be without my knowledge. Especially since I post my work to websites and other such things. I would like to be aware if any of my work could be submitted and be able to opt out without losing my ability to publish and work on my writing on the internet.
