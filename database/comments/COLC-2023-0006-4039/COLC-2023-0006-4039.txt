This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. My work is produced with my own blood, sweat and tears, yet I have no protection against someone just feeding it into an AI and do whatever they want with it. What I produced over days, weeks, months or even years can be stolen and messed with in seconds.
