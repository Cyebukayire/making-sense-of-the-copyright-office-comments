So called &quot;AI&quot; art is only accomplished by stealing work from human artists who have no control in their work being used for machine copying. Human artists are not consulted or compensated and it greatly diminishes human expression which is the purpose of artistic endeavor. Left unchecked human artists will suffer not only monetarily but emotionally and mentally in a world that already causes much grief to those trying to survive in a capitalist society. It is my belief that there should be severe safeguards for human works and enforcement of those guards within the use of &quot;AI&quot; machine learning and no protections allotted for creations made for these machines, for they have made them by copying human works. It&#39;s ironic that we are often asked to reassure via reCAPTCHA that we are not robots. I would request artistic endeavors be tagged with the same signature.
