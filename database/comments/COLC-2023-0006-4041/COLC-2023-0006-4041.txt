&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; as it currently exists is not in fact at all intelligent, and does not create anything in its own right; it borrows from others and mixes things together. It may do so intelligently (and sometimes extremely unintelligently), however it is not in fact creating anything at all new. I therefore strongly feel that anything thus produced should not be copyrightable and in fact borders on plagerism in its current state.
