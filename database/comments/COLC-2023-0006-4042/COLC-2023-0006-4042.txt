To me, it&rsquo;s an absolute no-brainer that AI should never by copyrightable. The reason for that is because AI is entirely incapable of creating new content without being trained on existing content. If material is used to teach AI to produce something, then all the underlying material used to train it should be credited and rewarded for their contributions. That is not happening with AI, and therefore it does not deserve to stand as it&rsquo;s own original copyrighted material.
