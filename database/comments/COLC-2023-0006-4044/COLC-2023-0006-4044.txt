AI poses a serious threat to all creative industries and I implore the US Copyright Office to consider the ramifications of allowing AI made work of any kind to be copywritten. At worst, many AI generators steal from the individual works of many artists, without credit or compensation or knowledge to the artist, devaluing the original works in the process. At best, companies using AI generators made from the body of their own copywritten work will use it as an excuse to hire less creatives and spend less money on actual human workers. Should such technology be allowed to be used without strict and protective guidelines that prioritizes working creatives, I fear the job loss would absolutely devastate millions of people which would ripple out to the entire US population to catastrophic affect. This is not a technology that invokes the idea of progress allowing people to work less dangerous and hazardous jobs, instead it threatens to strip something that has always been intrinsically linked to humanity- creation and the arts- and give it to the job of machines. It&#39;s obvious where many investors and company heads lie with this topic, as AI promises to cut costs and allow them to line their overly bloated pockets even more. But look no further to see where actual creative people&#39;s interests and ideals lie than that of the ongoing strikes for the WGA and SAG AFTRA. One of the foundational reasons they strike is for protections from the threat AI poses to destroy the entertainment industry, because they know if they cannot negotiate these protections, most of them will have no future at all. Please, listen to creatives, we want to work! Don&#39;t allow greedy companies to take that away from us.
