As an illustrator, I have seen firsthand the tumultous affect AI has had on the artist industry. The issue is not that machine learning is inherently bad, but rather that corporations and start-ups are using it without oversight and regulation, and are taking copyrighted and human-created material without permission to essentially create &#39;montages&#39; that they then use to replace original creators. Companies are already laying off talented workers and going for the cheap route of using AI to kit-bash an illustration or article together, because they don&#39;t have to pay as much (or at all). Of course, without human input, the results are deceptive and possibly misinformative. As we&#39;re seeing with the WGA/SAG strike, even Hollywood is not above taking people&#39;s likenesses and using AI to replicate them without permission, which opens up a whole other set of ethical issues. There&#39;s also the concern of &quot;deep fakes&quot; of celebrities and politicians, which can have devastating consequences to a person&#39;s life and career. Machine learning can be a great tool, but it is presently being used to exploit and upend the creative talents in the public sector, and the government really must step in and regulate this and provide protections for creatives and the public. To not keep control of this will result in upheaval and potentially dangerous, existential consequences if AI programs were allowed access to public utilities or defense systems.
