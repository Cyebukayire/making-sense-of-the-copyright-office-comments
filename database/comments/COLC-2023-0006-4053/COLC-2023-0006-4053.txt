AI is still not its own autonomous being that can create original works. It uses the work from other artists and creators to assemble something that is close to what was promoted. It relies on stolen works and cuts into the markets that those works are part of. There is no originality or even inspiration. It is relying on what has already been created to make something. Allowing AI produced art, or content to be copyrighted violates the copyright of the works that are already in existence.
