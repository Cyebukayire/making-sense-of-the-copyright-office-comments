I am a cyber security professional with twelve years of experience in the field, and without a doubt I wholeheartedly believe that AI-generated content should not be protected by copyright. The copyright system exists to protect human innovation and ingenuity, not the product of a machine. Novel AI systems themselves could potentially fall under the realm of copyright protection, but under no circumstances should the output of these models be afforded the same rights and protections as content produced by human beings. Much in the same way that a tornado ripping through a junkyard may produce something stacked in a way that is aesthetically pleasing, AI ingests and regurgitates human work into different forms - but this is not creativity or creation, and should not receive any more copyright protections than the leavings of a tornado.
