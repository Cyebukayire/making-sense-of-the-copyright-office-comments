I do not support copyrighting ai works, as it could mean ai being used by big companies for projects humans would usually be hired for, such as logos, writing scripts, art,  and so much more. I&#39;m a young college student, and I dont want to see companies use ai instead of real people, and providing copyright to ai works could send the message that using ai instead of real people is ok.
