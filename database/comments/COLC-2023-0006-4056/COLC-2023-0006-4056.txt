AI art is a very unethical tool that relies on stealing other peoples information and regurgitating the information out later to &ldquo;write&rdquo; an answer to a prompt. This is essentially the same as someone copying a written work, slightly shifting around the wording and trying to pass it off as their original work. If you allow AI art or writing, then you will be allowing people to steal the works of millions of others and profit off it immensely, with is anathema to copyrights purpose. Allowing ai art to flourish would be like allowing boys to spam your website with submissions without any way of stopping it, only on a much greater and more harmful scale. I hope that you listen to the concerns that I and countless others have and protect creative content of all kinds by banning the use of AI.
