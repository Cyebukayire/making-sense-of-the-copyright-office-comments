My understanding of copyright protections is that they extend to the person or people that create a work. The key word being a &quot;person&quot; so that their work (words, music, art, etc.), their intellectual property, will be protected.    AI stands for artificial intelligence. Artificial tends to mean not natural, imitated or simulated which can translate into imitated intelligence or simulated intelligence.    I do not believe that material created by a simulation should be afforded the same legal protection as that of a human being. <br/><br/>Yes, some of the material that AI can creating is remarkable. This material is still generated by the parameters, prompts or code that the intelligence has been programmed to use.    Programming is not a natural process for humans. I believe the law should continue to protect the human side of creation, thought and ingenuity and not the results that a machine can render forward.
