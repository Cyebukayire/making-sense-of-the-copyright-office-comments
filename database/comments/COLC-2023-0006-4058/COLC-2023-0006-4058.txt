As a writer and a consumer, I have massive concerns about AI. <br/><br/>As a writer, it is horrifying to know that anything I create and post on the internet can be scraped and stolen. It is just as bad to know that well-meaning fans of my work might put it into an AI like ChatGPT to get an alternate ending, and that ChatGPT now has my work. The fact that AI companies are not required to either get permission or be transparent about what their bots have been trained on means that I don&#39;t know if or how much of my work has been stolen.<br/><br/>As a consumer: First of all, I am just as upset about this as I would be if I found out a beloved book was plagiarized. To know that there are books and blogs and even newspaper articles out there that have been created via stolen content makes it difficult to figure out which content and which creators are worth my time and effort. I can easily see this becoming an issue of false advertising.<br/><br/>Second of all, this can and will lead to safety issues. There are already foraging books on Amazon written by AI--this will get people killed, because people will trust those books and end up eating plants that are poisonous. News articles written using AI and not fact-checked are already spreading misinformation, which, in times of a pandemic or severe weather, can lead people to trust incorrect safety information, or second-guess safety information. While lying is always an issue, using stolen content means that AI may be able to mimic accurate content well enough to endanger people.
