Artificial intelligence should be subject to the same if not more scrutinous laws as any other creator. <br/><br/>Corporations should not be able to utilize AI to get around patents, intellectual properties, or as a method to skirt bargaining obligations (see Netflix, Disney, etc with regards to the WGA strike).<br/><br/>AI functions as it is programmed. AI does not create, it steals from creations that already exist. Often this comes at the detriment to both the original creator and the consumer.
