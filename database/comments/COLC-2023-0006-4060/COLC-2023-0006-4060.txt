I am a 20 year old art student from Southern California, studying at Laguna College of Art and Design. It has been my dream to work in the entertainment industry for years now, I have spent years of my life working towards this goal, practicing, sketching, failing, trying again, and pouring hours of time into heartfelt works of art. One of the hardest truths of pursuing this career is that it is not owed to me. Just because I show up, or just because I want it, I do not deserve or own it. <br/><br/>The only thing I am owed is ownership of my art and my ideas. That&#39;s why I am hoping the government will protect this ownership. I am not asking for my career to be artificially shielded from the developments of the tech industry. I am asking for the basic norms of intellectual property be upheld. I want to know that my government won&#39;t bow to a new industry&#39;s utopian promises that were built on the theft of laborers across the world. This includes the theft of everyone, almost anything posted on the internet is now subject to scrapping. And while right now this applies primarily towards the creative fields that many consumers may undervalue the importance of, it will soon pervade other jobs as well. <br/><br/>There is a lot of fear in the artist community that the government will roll over and let AI companies pillage humanity&#39;s collective intelligence and creativity to repackage it for sale and destroy the individual&#39;s access to commercialize their own work. I hope that this fear can serve as an example and a warning of what will happen if we do nothing. Whether that is by replacing their jobs, producing illegal content matter, or by providing unreliable or harmful information framed as advice, the list of ethical dilemmas is long. AI is a part of our world now, but it has to work and take the shape that benefits humans. Regulations have to benefit humans. AI art is being sold as a tool for artists, but the only people championing it are those who seek to profit from it. The perspective of artists is already quite clear. <br/><br/>Art is not just pretty pictures composed with high contrast, sampled color pallets, and subjects regurgitated from training data. It is not just a string of words that make logical sense. Art is communication. It&#39;s the expression of ideas, sharing the human experience, and in doing so connecting people of any walk of life through a unique and unparalleled means. It is about bringing people together through the connections we can&#39;t always identify on our own. It&#39;s about inspiring each other through the creation of ideas. I don&#39;t want to see a world where all artistic expression seen on the national and international stage is produced by machines. Images without vision, songs without connection, expression without experience, is cold and soulless. The future of art rests on the government&#39;s shoulders. I hope that you will protect it.
