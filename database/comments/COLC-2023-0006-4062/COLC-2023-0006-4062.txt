I request that the U.S. Copyright Office and all involved stakeholders disallow the use of copyrighted materials in training AI/machine-learning data sets. The foundation of machine-learning programs such as Chat GPT is this: stolen art and information from thousands upon thousands of often copyrighted materials, too often lacking the permission and consent of the copyright holders to have their materials used to train these data sets. <br/><br/>Furthermore, AI-generated materials, unless they are generated only through training models that utilize only the sole output of a singular copyright holder, should be ineligible for copyright - the very basis of machine-learning models relies upon the un-credited usage of copyrighted art and other such materials. To allow a copyright of AI &quot;art&quot; is to allow one to steal a painting from a museum, slap a sticker on its frame, and then copyright the stolen artwork as an original piece - there is nothing substantive or original about art produced solely through AI generation that warrants intellectual protection or the right to profit from it from a would-be copyright holder.
