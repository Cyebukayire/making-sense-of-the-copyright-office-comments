Hello, to whom this may concern. I am a creative in the comics industry writing and conceptualizing a comic series. The acts of Artificial Intelligence taking place in the Arts is a terrifying endeavor as it seeks to strip people like me of our value and hard work. Having my own work, something I put 30+ years into perfecting, put through a machine learning software to replicate my own, hard earned work is not something I am particularly pleased about - to put it lightly. And the fact that anyone can take my own likeness and work and simply copyright it without any permission or acknowledgment is heartbreaking. <br/>You don&#39;t go into a restaurant, order something and change a few things and claim ownership over that dish. You neither produced the food nor put the work into making it; you&#39;re simply consuming it. No different than an artists work being fed through a machine to &quot;alter it&quot; and put it out as their own.<br/>Not to mention the fact that I willingly work for free most days, while these people producing works based off my own work are making hundreds and thousands of dollars. That&#39;s simply abhorrent.<br/><br/>I urge the copyright office to please listen to us. Please hear the words of artists and creatives from all over and take a moment to understand that these works we create for the world to see are something bred from long nights of hard work and dedication. I did not get a BFA to be stepped on by a machine.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time, and I hope you - the one reading this - has a wonderful day.
