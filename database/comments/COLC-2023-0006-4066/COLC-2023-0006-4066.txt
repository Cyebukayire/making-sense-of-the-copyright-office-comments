1. My biggest concern is how AI generated creative works will affect an already underpaid and very competitive industry. I have seen arguments that AI is no different than the invention of tools such as Photoshop, however, the major difference is still the Human element. While photoshop makes the creation of art mush faster and easier, it still does not create the image for you. AI can severely cheapen an entire industry overnight in a time where people are already struggling with inflations and joblessness. <br/>2. I in Motion Graphics, which at the moment is not at risk of AI takeover, however, the more it learn the closer it is to taking away potential jobs from more and more industries. We already saw Marvel use AI for their opening of Secret Invasion and it gained a lot of scrutiny, yet we have witnessed the last few years of studios completely ignoring consumer opinion in favor of money saving and profit increase. <br/>3. NA<br/>4. NA<br/>5. AI needs to, at the very least, be clearly marked. We must require all AI generators to leave a permanent tag or marker so that it can be identified and no AI can be generated with materials it does not have permissions to use. We need to protect people from AI generated pornography, defamation, and any other ways a person could be negatively affected by realistic AI generated images.
