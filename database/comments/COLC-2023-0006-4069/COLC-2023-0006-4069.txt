I think AI art specifically should be considered in the same regard as commissioning another artist to make something for you. Even if you are granted some degree of rights to use it, you shouldn&#39;t be able to pass it off as your own or not reveal that AI was used to make it. If you zoom in on an AI generated image and reselect a space to change or add something, that might as well be the same as sending a piece back to the artist for feedback. If you are the one making true artistic modifications to an AI made product, then... I don&#39;t know.<br/>As for the way it is produced, in my opinion (as an artist), the primary concern is to protect the work and livelihoods of traditional artists, while granting people the option to explore this technology and increase productivity. Artists should be able to control whether or not their work is used for AI training. The question is &quot;Who needs protecting?&quot; It&#39;s not the wealthy corporations or the people online trying to sell AI work as their own. It&#39;s the people who are trying to make a living by doing commission work. People should be allowed to grant the rights to their pieces to be trained on for AI, but it should be a choice and it should have compensation, both up-front, and, hopefully on a piece by piece basis for each time their work is specifically used in the tags of a prompt. <br/>The point shouldn&#39;t be to limit the production of AI art or to speed up the process of the obsoletion of human artists, but to allow people to use AI to enhance and optimize their creativity, while allowing protections for the artists upon which the models are built. For any AI generated work, even beyond art, consent of the people whose data the models are trained on is critical. How consent can be granted by every artist all at once remains to be seen, but it must be an opt-in process.<br/>Sincerely and hopefully,<br/>Sam, a concerned artist who wants the best of both worlds. <br/>
