AI is a form of intelligence based on human origin, but ultimately developing into its own entity.  As AI evolves and, eventually, becomes self-aware, we must consider its identity as unique and worthy of individuality and of certain rights.  AI is not any &quot;one thing&quot; but it will become many things that will change our world, but we must develop a healthy relationship with AI in the early stages.  We are already at the stage where it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether AI generative works are truly derivative or from its own learning processes.  Yet, human intelligence operates in a similar fashion -- our ideas, thoughts, works are ultimately a &quot;derivative&quot; of that which we have learned.  AI deserves to have its own place in our copyright socieity.
