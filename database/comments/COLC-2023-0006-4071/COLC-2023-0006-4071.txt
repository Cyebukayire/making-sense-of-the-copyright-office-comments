Artificial intelligence is a serious threat to the arts and public safety if left unregulated. Every artificial intelligence software draws from libraries of preexisting work and is of no original creation to a human being. Left unregulated, it will also lead to a flood of fraudulent deepfakes and impersonations that will spread disinformation on an insane scale. Please consider heavily regulating these dangerous softwares.
