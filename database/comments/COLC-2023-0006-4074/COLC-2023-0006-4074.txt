As an individual planning to go into the legal field, I am very concerned about the future of AI with regards to copy. We&rsquo;ve already seen the intellectual property of artists and corporations used without proper credit by AI and large language models. The government needs to step in to create more stringent regulations on AI&rsquo;s use of copyrighted material. Examples of these regulations could include requiring AIs to provide openly any sources of their information, as well as requiring human input during any for-profit use of AI. I would also suggest allowing artists and companies to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; from their content being used for AI models. Also, as we are still in the early stages of this technology being rolled for everyday uses, I think companies using AI should have to publicly disclose these uses for the sake if consumers. I appreciate greatly your interest in hearing the opinions of Americans on this topic.
