I am an author and believe strongly in the importance of storytelling as a part of what it means to be human. So I have deep reasons for believing that storytelling belongs to human beings. But I also believe that practically speaking, granting copyright to machines that can spew out endless mindless variations of stories, hundreds per second, will not just sit alongside human creations, but will have a chilling effect on them. If I can program a machine to write endless facsimiles of stories around the clock, how difficult will that make it for human beings to claim copyright? Setting up a world where machines get copyright will drown the world in an ocean of bad stories that cover every variable, destroying the ability of humans to sell and profit from their hard-made creations. Please do not consider granting rights to a machine.
