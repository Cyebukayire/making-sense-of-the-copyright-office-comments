The level of work anyone will have to do to make sure AI is not breaking copyright law is... indescribably gigantic. Godspeed and good luck to anyone who is put to the impossible in a human lifetime task of trying to make that work.<br/>---<br/>Main reasons are as follows.<br/>1. Teaching AI to not use copyrighted works, or making works from learning with non-copyrighted material can easily make things that are copy written.<br/>2. Humans are pretty good at breaking copyright already, giving them a sophisticated tool to do so will make it beyond worse then it already is.<br/>3. Trying to solve the problem on all levels will be impossible, from small business use, personal, big business. Main reason being too many people using it at the same time.<br/>TL;DR Good luck and god help you if you are employed to do anything related to AI Copyright work.
