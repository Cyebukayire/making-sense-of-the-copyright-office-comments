AI fundamentally needs regulation. AI indiscriminately uses copyrighted art or the art of other artists in its learning and generation. This tool in the hands of corporations harms artists. Artist fear putting their work online due to the threat of AI stealing their work and putting artists means of earning a income in jeopardy. AI also disincentives organizations from hiring real talented people. How does this look as a country that was built on the idea&quot;life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot;?  Pursue happiness except if your happiness is art, then don&#39;t pursue that happiness cause we have robots that for us? AI technology is in its infancy, now is the best time to impose regulations. I worry without proper regulation of AI will harm the creative influence in the US and the livelyhood of artists who live here. I won&#39;t argue whether or not AI generated art is &quot;real&quot; art or what even qualifies as art but I will end my statement with this fact to reflect on. AI generated art as it is right now cant get human hands right (multiple fingers, placement of joints and fingernails). Meanwhile the earliest works of art done by people was of our hands on the walls of caves. AI is a tool not a replacement for real people and needs regulations to reflect that!
