You cannot copywrite something that was not created by a human. Trying to copyright AI art would be the equivalent of trying to copyright the shape of a cloud you saw outside - ludicrous. No human was involved in the creation. Similarly, it makes no sense to list an AI generator as &quot;an author&quot;. It&#39;s equivalent to claiming Microsoft Word is an author just because it was used, or a physical printer as an artist because you printed with it. <br/>AI generators are not human, and the output therefore cannot be copyrighted. There is however another major issue with these generators, and that is the fact that they function only by consuming enormous quantities of copyrighted material. There should absolutely be severe consequences for this. The fact that these generators can and do produce &quot;art&quot; in the style of well-known artists is a gross violation of copyright. If a human were to do the same, they would be rightfully punished. We cannot hold the machine to the same standards, as it is (evidently) not human, but the creators of the generator should be charged. They have knowingly stolen art and deliberately tried to replicate it. That is theft and breach of copyright. Furthermore, the generators do not truly have intelligence. They are merely enormous statistical models. There is no argument that they are &quot;creating&quot; anything: the best they can do is, quite literally, copy the &quot;most likely&quot; behaviour of a human. Art is an intrinsically human activity, an expression of one&#39;s soul, and the output is protected by copyright laws. AI generators have no soul. What they produce is not art, it is a copyright breach. Please, protect real artists and punish the developers who have stolen their copyrighted works.
