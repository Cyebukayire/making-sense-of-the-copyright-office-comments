I am writing to share my strong concerns about AI&#39;s flagrant and abhorrent disregard for US copyright law. Not only are many AI trained off copyrighted data sets, written materials, and works of art- without any permission granted by copyright holders- AI&#39;s deliberate obfuscation of source additionally leave users no way to verity the origins of statements, artistic content, or other material. This deliberately manufactured confusion and ambiguity prevents users from making thoughtful use of AI that respects the rights of copyright holders under US law. Scripts that auto-generate text and images (aka AI) should, at the bare minimum, be required to demonstrate that the texts and images used to seed that generation were used with permission of the copyright holders or from public domain images and text. I entreat the U.S. Copyright Office to fully consider the legal and moral issues with allowing AI&#39;s continued exploitation of copyrighted material without the consent of those holding the copyright.
