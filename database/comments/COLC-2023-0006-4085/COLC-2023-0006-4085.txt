I&#39;m an artist, I&#39;m poor, and I&#39;ve dreamed of making some kind of living at art for my entire life. But it&#39;s increasingly difficult to get jobs because people are going to AI for free. But not only that, over a decade of work I&#39;ve put online gets fed into the AI programs, and I get zero credit or funding from the money people make with it. Nobody does. My works are copyrighted by US law! But I can&#39;t fight the ai programs, they&#39;re too dodgy and obscure, even though websites (like Deviantart, Twitter, Instagram, and more) get used to train these programs, against the copyright holders&#39; wishes. Disney alone needs to get rid of these programs since they&#39;re constantly scraping all the new Disney art and content that they can. Art theft is theft, theft is theft, it&#39;s violating millions of people&#39;s copyright&mdash;including video, including text. I&#39;ve seen films get scraped and put into it, people are generating fake &quot;Wes Anderson&quot; (and other film makers) content. Just some typing and users gladly break copyright to pump out soulless content, and none of the original visual/film/literary/photography artists get anything out of it. They had a problem for a while with the Getty Images logo being in a bunch of the output, because even that website was scraped. Please do something to help.
