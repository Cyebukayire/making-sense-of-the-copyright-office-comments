I find AI technology absolutely fascinating and I&#39;m excited for the ways it can be used and other technology it will enable.  <br/><br/>However, my big concern is that this technology is built on stolen material.  AI wouldn&#39;t work without the datasets it&#39;s trained on.  Which means all the artists and writers whose work it is using for in essence programers, but not being compensated for the work they contributed, furthermore without their consent. I&#39;d like to see AI technology further developed, but making sure everyone is fairly compensated for their work.<br/><br/>Finally, my other big concern for AI is that its more technology in the vein of replacing humans instead of trying argument them.
