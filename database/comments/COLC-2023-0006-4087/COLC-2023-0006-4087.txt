Generative AI art shouldn&#39;t be copywritable. Partially because of its requirement to steal original art to make anything in the first place, stealing the copywright. And partially because it is not intelligently creating art in the first place. It just figures out what word, what color, what sound, most likely follows the previous. It cannot create copywrited works the same way autocorrect doesn&#39;t create copywritable works. It didn&#39;t make anything. It&#39;s just probabilities.
