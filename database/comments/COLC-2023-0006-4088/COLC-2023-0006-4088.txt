AI is not an intelligence at all, but a collection or stolen materials that make a &lsquo;coherent&rsquo; string of words. The people who advocate for AI have no actual understanding if it, other than some rich billionaire they would like to fuck tells them to. AI is stolen work, and therefore should no be allowed to have its &lsquo;creations&rsquo; be copyrighted. Especially since they could be stealing already copy written works like Writing or Art.
