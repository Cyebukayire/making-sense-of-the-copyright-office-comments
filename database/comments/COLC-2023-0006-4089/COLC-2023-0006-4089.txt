Artists and all humans need to be protected from unauthorized use of their art and images and work by AI. A human being&rsquo;s creative output or art or writing or image SHOULD NEVER be used without explicit permission. This is a huge reason the WGA and SAG unions are holding out in their strikes. If these protections are not put in place now, we will all suffer for it.
