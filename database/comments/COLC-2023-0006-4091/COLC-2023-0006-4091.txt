I believe Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is not actually true AI, that utilizes sources where the creators are not appropriately and adequately compensated for such use should make the subsequent work unable to be copyrighted. As a matter of fact, many comments submitted via this form will likely be generated by text AI. Legislation around AI should take into account that AI is a tool no different from an Excel spreadsheet. It does not act of its own accord and the potential for abuse, deception, and copyright violation need to be weighed extremely carefully and heavily when creating regulations.
