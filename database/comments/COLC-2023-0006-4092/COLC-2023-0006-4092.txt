Copyright should apply to any non-autonomous AI-generated work that has been labelled as such. Human expression must be protected and AI generation is, and should be, a tool of said expression. A human still has to start with an idea, and refine that idea within the capabilities of the AI generation tool, that remains worthy of protection. AI should NOT be duplicitously labelled, an AI generated work should not be passed off as another medium (e.g. AI generated images should not be submitted as or called photography or digital painting/drawing), but digital manipulation is already recognised as an artistic medium in its own right, and AI generation is another tool in that toolbox.
