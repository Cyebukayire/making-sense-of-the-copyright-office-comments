Hello, I am concerned with unregulated Artificial Intelligence usage because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse - especially, but not limited to, visual artistis. Therefore, regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.
