I am a software developer currently working in industry. I have taken courses on machine learning and artificial intelligence, and my workplace has projects that are developing AI technologies. I&#39;m not particularly eloquent, so I don&#39;t know if this will actually be useful to anyone, but I figured saying something not quite right is better than not saying anything and risk having only untrue statements be considered.<br/>There&#39;s a lot to be said about the ethics of AI - copyright infringement and bias being the biggest among them. I&#39;m concerned about these things, but not in the mood to write a thesis about it, as these things are broadly discussed by people lobbying against AI. The thing that concerns me most is how the people directing the use and development of AI don&#39;t actually understand how it works well enough to understand its strengths and limitations. I see headlines about how ChatGPT can&#39;t do math and makes things up, and people act surprised by this fact. Of course it can&#39;t do math and makes things up! It&#39;s just figuring out what the most statistically likely response is, based on the prompt. It doesn&#39;t know what truth or fiction is and there&#39;s no way to make it understand that because it is a glorified math problem. This is also a problem with the attempts to legislate restrictions on AI - how many lawmakers actually understand how language models work or the difference between transparent and nontransparent AI methods. (In other words, whether you can figure out how the AI made the choice that it made or not). There are so many things that AI would be SO good at and really raise society up, but those are things that aren&#39;t glamorous or exciting - automating a lot of the boring and tedious tasks of &quot;minimum wage jobs&quot; comes to mind. But the individuals funding AI development don&#39;t care about improving society, they care about making money, and so AI will be developed not to be useful or to free up people&#39;s time, but to cut corners and replace jobs, and because they don&#39;t understand how these AIs actually work they will end up with worse products and services. Sure, the free market could regulate that, but that&#39;s in a healthy economy where people can afford housing and have more agency in where they live and work. Our current economy has too many people living paycheck to paycheck to actually create market shifts towards better products and services when companies like Amazon and Google and Walmart are the cheapest players in town.
