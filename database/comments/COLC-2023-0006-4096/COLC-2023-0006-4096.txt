AI should not be allowed to utilize copyrighted material (such as art, books, documents, etc.) without explicit permission of the owner of the copyright. This should include using it as one of many &quot;reference&quot; materials used for AI creation. Any AI creation that uses copyrighted material, no matter how &quot;transformed&quot; the final creation is at it&#39;s finished state, should still require permission from the owner of the copyright.<br/><br/>Furthermore, AI material should not be copyrightable in itself, following the logic above.
