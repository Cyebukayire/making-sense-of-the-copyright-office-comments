The current AI usage in art need to be regulated. At this moment, so many AI art generators are fed up using resources from arts which is not authorized by the artist themselves, leaving them to get nothing from the AI usage. This does not benefit the artists at all, and instead falls under art theft. Every arts that used for AI learning shall be consented by the artist themselves first, and any art that doesn&#39;t gain the artist&#39;s consent should fall under copyright infringement, and shall face required charge for its usage to be ceased.<br/><br/>Regarding copyright, any AI art used from this result of unauthorized arts in training shall never be able to gain copyright, nor AI arts itself, as arts produced by AI are machine-made, and not human-made at all. A machine/computer shall never able to gain copyright.
