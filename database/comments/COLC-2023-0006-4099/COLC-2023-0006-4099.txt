At this point, every commercially available Generative &quot;AI&quot; (really just a system to predict which word might come next) and their attached &quot;LLM&quot; are based, almost entirely, on either explicitly copyrighted works, scraping the web (which content is covered by implicit copyright, just like an unpublished story), or both.<br/><br/>There is no ethical application of this technology in its current form.   Only when the creators of the source material are able to give consent and be compensated will Generative &quot;AI&quot; be an ethical option.  <br/><br/>Ethical or not, all of the works are derived from works with existing copyrights, so allowing them to be copyrighted themselves is a threat to the original copyright holder&#39;s rights.<br/>
