Without a way to digitally watermark the history of scripts written for film and TV, there&#39;s no way to safeguard this material, including my own writing for TV shows such as Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, from being used and incorporated into &quot;new&quot; material generated by A.I.  Authors would need to be compensated, but it would be impossible without the watermarks to know who is owed money.
