Silicon Valley is already out of control, disrupting things no one asked them to do&mdash;TV/Film, NFTs, and Cryptocurrency. Now AI. They&#39;re looking to replace those of us who create art, such as myself as a writer. That&#39;s not the future I was promised. I was promised a future where tech would replace mundane work so we could create art free of worry. Now it&#39;s the opposite. The greed of the corporations will do anything not to pay people for their creative efforts. Now with AI, they can, in theory, just replace us with a machine. I don&#39;t want to live in a world where machines plagiarize and regurgitate art that&#39;s come before or already exists. Making it a paint-by-numbers effort. And Hollywood is already an Ouroboros, obsessed with IP and algorithms (the latter thanks to Silicon Valley thinking). How much worse will it become with AI? What is art without the human experience? Without the pain, the tears, the loves, the joys of a real person? What will we become of a society? And if AI replaces the creative, then who will pay and consume for this art? Unfettered, unregulated capitalism (thanks, Regan, you asshole) is killing us, both physically and spiritually. We need to reign this in or else our art will no longer feed the soul and only feed the wallets of CEOs.
