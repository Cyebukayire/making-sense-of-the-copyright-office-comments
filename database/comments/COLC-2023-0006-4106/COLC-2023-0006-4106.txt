Hello, I am a college professor in the state of NJ and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright, to agency, to academic honesty, and to livelihoods. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. Unregulated AI is a threat because it removes the person from the process; it creates a lack of thought in things (like writing and drawing and arting in general) that require a human touch. Furthermore, it teaches students that laziness is akin to excellence; it does not promote critical thinking, nor does it promote the art of practice, which we all know leads to success. It does not take into account the time and the effort spent on the creation; it does not give credit to the human hand that was, at some point, behind the work. All of this is dangerous when we think about living in an honest and ethical world, one where we are all citizens striving for a common good.<br/><br/>While there are (I&#39;m sure, somewhere) good uses for AI, regulations, could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Reasonable regulations would protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense. I sincerely hope that the study will look to protect copyright law, and protect those of us who are doing the creating behind the work that AI scrapes and steals without our permission.
