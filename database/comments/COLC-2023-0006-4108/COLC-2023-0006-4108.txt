I believe that ai content farming is severely detrimental to the livelyhoods of artists and writers, and the safety of consumers. For example there are many foraging books being put on online book stores or printed for store shelves that are entirely ai generated content. This would mean that someone could be poisoned by eating something the ai writing says is safe and trustworthy. They are being posted faster than the existing ones can be reviewed and removed.
