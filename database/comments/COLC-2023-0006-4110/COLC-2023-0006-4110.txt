I have a lot of reservations about the way AI technology is being used in the creative sector. There&#39;s been admitted and unrestricted scraping of copyrighted material by companies like ChatGPT, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, and more. This is an abuse of the law and a threat to the livelihoods of the creators who make the artwork that this tech consumes and subsequently spits out without care for who it&#39;s plagiarizing and profiting from.<br/><br/>AI involvement in every facet of our lives isn&#39;t inevitable, nor do I think it should be welcomed when it involves this kind of careless disregard for the humans behind the machines&#39; success. I strongly feel there need to be restrictions on the datasets these companies are allowed to use to train their AIs, or appropriate compensation for the artists/writers affected.<br/><br/>This goes for voice artists and translators as well.<br/>
