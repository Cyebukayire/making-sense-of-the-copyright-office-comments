Chastity Senek <br/> I am not affiliated with any particular organization however I do feel like AI needs to be addressed in all fields. While artificial intelligence can be a support to different professions there must be protections afforded to artists no matter their medium whether it be the written word, paint pencil, charcoal, textile, marker, beads, or pastel.  Misinformation and stolen work are currently highly concerning in terms of the incorporation of AI into artistic modalities without regulations regarding safety to others and the protection of digital or manual artists&#39; work.  AI systems should only be trained on works that the artist has agreed to participate in the training and as such should be compensated for such use. AI  reations should be marked as such with clear labeling that shows the artificial intelligence nature of the work and not allowing those pieces to be passed off as traditional artists&#39; work. Companies should not be allowed to dictate that employees or contracted artists <br/>agree to allow their work or physical likenesses to be used to trainAI systems as each individual should be afforded their own autonomy and free will in regards to their likeness and creative properties. Additionally in this process the use of AI models within the fashion industry should be banned as the misuse of AI models representing minority populations has already occurred.
