AI is copyright infingement. It&rsquo;s theft. And the worst part is that it&rsquo;s undetectable. There&rsquo;s no consent, no credit, and no compensation. These language models are built on the backs of foreign slave labor, with one goal: to eliminate artists. We need AI to be regulated NOW before it&rsquo;s too late. And we need artists, and the unions that represent them to be leading the regulation. NOT the corporations who stand to make billions off the elimination of artist jobs. Please. Act now.<br/>
