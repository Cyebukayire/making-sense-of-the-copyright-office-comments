I will start by saying that &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is a misnomer, as what you are seeking comments on is generally machine learning. This means that it has the same biases as the people who made it and what it was trained on. If true artificial intelligence was here, it might become its own person who creates things, but this machine learning technology just repurposes what exists with no artistic intent. It is a tool to be used by people, and photoshopping my face on a picture does not make it my copyright, just because I made it with a tool. Therefore, I believe things made using AI should not fall under copyright, and there needs to be channels for artists to remove their art from the pool of art being used to train these AI (or some other sort of legal protection for artists against AI). I hope a human is reading this, if so I hope you&#39;re having a nice day.
