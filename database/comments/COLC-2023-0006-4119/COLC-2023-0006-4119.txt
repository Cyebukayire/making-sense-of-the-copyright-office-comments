AI is harmful. It profits from the work and effort of real people and has no real use apart from &quot;looking cool&quot;. Many artists, voice actors, etc feel uncomfortable and upset that their work is being taken without permission and made into something completely different by artificial intelligence, AI art does not have the same effort, meaning, creativity, or anything that real, human art has.
