AI as it&#39;s currently known is a misnomer. The technology being touted as AI is not intelligent; it lacks discernment and judgement, both essential elements of the creative process, and essential components of what makes new products worth legal protection, via patent, copyright, or any other government-mandated means. What it produces should automatically be impossible to protect via the channels available to human creators, because everything it produces is derivative of existing works, without any intervention that could be deemed satirical, creative, or otherwise new. I would urge regulators to protect the original works AI steals and incorporates into its production process, but explicitly exclude from such protections any works or products that lack adequate human intervention to constitute/create originality.
