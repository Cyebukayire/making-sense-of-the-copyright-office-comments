Most of us have, for a large part of our lives, been inundated with fictional visions of futuristic A.I as a benevolent, helpful creation meant to ease our everyday burdens. Equally as prevalent are the fictional visions of A.I as destructive and evil. As we have seen in our very real present, the latter seems to be the more accurate reality. <br/><br/>A.I content--as a writer and artist myself I cannot in good conscience call anything produced by such systems &quot;art&quot;--is by its very nature, completely antithetical to what the Copyright Office, and its laws, stand for. Copyright seeks to protect the individual and the fruits of their creative labor and expression. What labor, what toil, what effort, is there in A.I content? <br/><br/>Every image and every word generated by these systems is nothing more than the amalgamated theft of the very real efforts of untold millions. A thief may hold temporary possession of their ill gotten gains, but they are never its rightful owner. <br/><br/>A.I content cannot, and should not, ever be copyrighted. Do the right thing: continue to protect the true creations of hard working, creative American PEOPLE.
