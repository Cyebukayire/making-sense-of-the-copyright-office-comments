AI Art takes jobs from human artists, designers, illustrators, and uses their work without their consent or compensation to create what it calls &ldquo;new work&rdquo;. It also devalues the years of practice, unique vision, skill and experience that human artists work hard for and they are marketed as a way to undercut artists, to get that image you need for the cover of your novel without actually paying an artist a living wage.<br/><br/>AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. This means that if the data used to train the algorithms contains bias, the AI art produced will also be biased. This raises important ethical questions about the role of AI in art and the potential for AI art to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination.<br/><br/>AI algorithms are designed to generate images and videos based on mathematical algorithms, rather than personal experience or feeling.
