Companies making Machine Learning models need to adhere to the same regulations as everyone else. They must legally acquire licenses and the explicit consent of the copyright owners, they can&#39;t just scrape other people&#39;s work and personal/private information. They can&#39;t get away with loopholes where they gather data for &quot;research purposes&quot; but then use the same data to train their models for commercial purposes. They also need to be held accountable for the negative effects it&#39;s having worldwide, within creative industries and with individuals.<br/><br/>Within creative industries, it&#39;s affecting artists, writers, actors, etc. By directly taking their work and even identity, feeding it to a software to train it so that it can then spit out replicas in seconds, and then these outputs are put on sale within the same markets as the people they ripped off, directly competing against them. Since a lot of the ai models and their users often use the names of creative people in their outputs, it&#39;s made it increasingly difficult to separate which are made by who, further muddying the waters. <br/><br/>It&#39;s also affecting people on an individual level, fostering dangerous environments with people relying on these software in parasocial relationships. And it&#39;s further corroding people&#39;s abilities to build resilience and patience to nurture their skills, instead rewarding instant gratification.<br/><br/>There&#39;s also AI models that give their users the ability to create pornographic material with the combined photographs of individuals who did not consent to have their photographs used in this way, including children and underaged individuals.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things that need to be taken into account before releasing these machine learning models, the companies in charge need to be held accountable, need to be transparent about every aspect of their models, from the way they were built, the legality of their data acquisition, to their usage, output, and the effects it&#39;s having on the general public.
