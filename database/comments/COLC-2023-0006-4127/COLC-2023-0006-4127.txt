When it comes to whether or not a product that utilizes AI is copyrightable. I believe that the input of AI should not outweigh the input of humans. As for the specific amount of AI input that can be used in a product to make it copyrightable, it should either be used as an editing tool in the likes of other online tools such as Grammarly or not used at all. Additionally, I believe AI, and by extension, the companies using it, should not be legally allowed to replicate the likeliness of an existing human as it has the potential to threaten people&#39;s livelihoods. This includes mainly their physical appearance and voice. In terms of AI being used for art, media, films, games, and shows, companies should not be allowed to use other people&#39;s creations as training data for machine learning models without explicit permission from the human who made them. This includes careers such as visual artists, writers, actors, producers, and directors. Finally, any product that is created by mostly AI should be legally required to have a visual and auditory indicator that it is made with AI. In conclusion, any product predominantly made by humans should be copyrightable. If AI is the dominant force behind a product, it should not be copyrightable at all with no exceptions.
