AI art is nothing of the sort, and is more akin to a mockery of true ingenuity. AI art requires no skill and no imagination, merely the absence of it. It is a literal theft of real work, a stolen catalogue of creation. When the first photographers spent hours laboring over their work, when Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo spilled their blood onto the canvas, they looked for a future where anyone could pick up a pen and brush, not one where art belongs soley to souless machines and unjust thieves.
