I am thoroughly opposed to AI technologies taking away creative jobs that should be held by writers, actors, directors, artists, and other creative professionals. This is most evidently put as a threat to American jobs within the American film industry with movie studios trying to utilize AI technologies to deprive working people of honest work. There should be laws in place that prevent corporations from taking advantage of workers to minimize the pay given but maximize the profit derived from AI combined with the work put in by employees.
