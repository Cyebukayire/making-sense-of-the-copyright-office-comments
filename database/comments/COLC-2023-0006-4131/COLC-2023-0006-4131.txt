I would be horrified, dismayed, and feel powerless to know that my years of hard work to create a piece of written material was then stolen. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s AI or physical theft of my book, script, or any other material. *I* created it. It is, quite literally, theft. <br/>This is one of the main reasons governments and its agencies exist: to protect its citizens. Please protect your fellow citizens from AI theft. Thank you very much.
