I am seriously concerned because ALL use of AI is unethical. Reasonable regulations may protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation, if there&#39;s not an option to prevent it altogether (which would be preferable). AI is otherwise nothing but a theft tool that steals from original creators, both professionally and fan created. It&#39;s a threat to both creativity and productivity, and to the livelihood of artists and writers everywhere.
