I am an actor. My unique voice and face, along with my skills that I&#39;ve spent decades and many thousands of dollars in cultivating, are my livelihood. Acting is my literal job. It is how my wife and I feed ourselves, pay our bills, and keep ourselves insured. Artifical Intelligence&#39;s introduction to the various field of the humanities has been an egregious oxymoron, for there is nothing human about it. It siphons and aggregates what we human artists create, and pervert it into another mere corporate commodity for sale by faceless entities. The cost is jobs like mine. The price for unregulated AI in the arts is that many hundreds of thousands of artists will be rendered broken in favor of CEOs. I don&#39;t expect you to care for common artists more than dilettante businessmen -- you&#39;ve proven time and again that you&#39;ll always favor business over art. What we are seeing now is the culmination of a culture that has depreciated the humanities in favor of STEM. Artists have worked so hard to make their art their livelihood, so you cannot just take it from us. We have worked hard DESPITE receiving less government support, so you owe it to us to regulate AI so it may leave us alone. Start valuing art and the humanities, please. Start now. Anything created with AI is stolen. It uses OUR creations against our will and against our knowledge. Regulate AI, please. There must be consequences to using software or hardware that steals as its primary feature.
