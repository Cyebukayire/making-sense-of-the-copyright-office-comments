Artificial intelligence has great potential to increase the efficiency of humans across all sorts of fields and spaces, but in terms of copyright i believe there needs to be someone (or someone representing an entity) creating the idea to be copywritten. I am especially concerned about AI in regards to artistic spaces, and do not believe any machine created art should be permitted copyright except in the case that all artists who provided material to train the AI are given equal share of ownership.
