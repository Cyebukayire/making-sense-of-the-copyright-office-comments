Greetings there, my name is Emmerich, I am an independent and disabled artist barely living off of my art in the gorgeous and vast state of Alaska. As AI and ML technologies have begun to pop up left and right, it seems most people in the broader scope of the public simply do not understand how the generative outputs can come to be. <br/><br/>AI is a machine, it will never be a human nor will it be able to envision something for itself. Everything it produces is a mesh of combinations made from the backs of uncompensated, unpaid, and highly exploited artists such as myself. I know countless of artists who&#39;s art has been scalped and thrown into these datasets. No one was ever asked, contacted, or compensated.<br/><br/>When artists share their work online, it is not free to take and use willy nilly. Many of us share our work that has been made for clients, personal projects (novels, comics, animation, etc), and more. We share it to show our skills, our honed craft, and to expand the reach of business while also teaching, inspiring, and cultivating a community. <br/><br/>Generative AI should NOT include ANY source that was not specifically sought after for permissions, compensation, or mutual agreement. It is unfair for these large companies to steal BILLIONS of files and data for their own profit while simultaneously releasing the same technology to replace and disrupt working fields. As of right now, there are absolutely ZERO good faith actors in the realm of generative AI and machine learning. <br/><br/>Everyone of them is looking for profit. <br/><br/>I believe generative AI and ML with where they stand should not be allowed to exist without regulations, oversight, and fair compensation to every artist who&#39;s works have been scalped. To save pennies, these companies seek to erase human creation and condition a world to cheap, low quality, zero effort content from stole. <br/><br/>People have lost jobs already due to this tech and I myself went from making a solid income, to struggling.<br/><br/>A large majority of artists have a disability or condition. We create to survive, to inspire, and to tell stories. <br/><br/>AI will disrupt and displace thousands of hard, honest working folk who have been the backbone of so much of our society. Clothing, Architecture, Movies, Music, Animation, even down to culinary arts. At the core of everything, art is there. Art has always been there. <br/><br/>Please do not allow corporations who do not care one ounce for people beyond what their wallets bring in to erase humanity from creation.
