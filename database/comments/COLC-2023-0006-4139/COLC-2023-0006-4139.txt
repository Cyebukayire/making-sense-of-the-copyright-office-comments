Thank you for opening this up to the people.<br/>I was an artist who used my works to create an income. I had an education and was ready to go into the work force in a field that needed artists. But the surge of AI art generators is threatening to tear apart the job market. I cannot post my portfolio to advertise my skills because I know AI trainers will just download it to teach their AI how to do my work. People do not want to pay for the art they want because they can effortlessly type a word until they get what they want. I live in great fear that the very words I type could be used to train a program to impersonate me. And none of it will be owned by me.<br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/>
