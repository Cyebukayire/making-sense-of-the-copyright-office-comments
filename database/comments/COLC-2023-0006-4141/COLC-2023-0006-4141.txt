I have a background in visual art and in IT. Copyright law already classifies the sort of output generated through the use of AI software. It constitutes a form of unlicensed derivative work. Leave aside all of the software developer anthropomorphic euphemisms and just address the basics of the technology. All computers share the same basic functions: data input, data storage, data processing, and data output. All software, including artificial intelligence software, no matter how advanced or complex the code, also shares these basic functions. How the software processes data is not relevant. Anthropomorphic terms like &#39;knows&#39; or &#39;learns&#39; or even &#39;neural&#39; are not relevant. <br/><br/>The output is a product of the input data being processed. If the input data is copyrighted material (such as imagery or text scraped from the internet without permission from copyright owners), it gets processed, some of it stored in memory (temporary or semi-permanent), and the output is derived from that copyrighted input. In some cases, thousands of copyrights may be violated in generating a single derivative image as output. In others, a single artist or work may be recognizable enough to identify them uniquely as a plaintiff. Regardless, the output could not exist without first processing the copyrighted input data.<br/><br/>Processing is not an act of inspiration. A computer, running AI software, crunches numbers and uses data input, data processing, data storage, and data output to perform a task. Unfortunately, instead of creating original datasets for input, many AI software developers have instead chosen to seek potential loopholes in copyright law. The US Copyright Office should set an example by requiring AI software developers to obtain licensing from copyright owners for including copyrighted works as input data. Furthermore, all AI generated output that utilizes copyrighted input data should be legally defined as derivative.<br/><br/>AI software developers can alternately create their own original input datasets, that exclude any existing copyrighted works for which they have no license, in order to comply with existing law regarding derivative works.
