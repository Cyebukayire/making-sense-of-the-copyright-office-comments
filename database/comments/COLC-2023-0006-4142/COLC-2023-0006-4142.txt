The current regulations are self-contradictory in several ways. <br/><br/>Copyright is not held by the worker, but by the rights holder. Sometimes those are the same entity, but often they are not. In the commercial world, the copyright holder is the entity that funds the project and/or gives instructions to workers. Legally, the people who worked on the project have no claim to copyright. The legal creator and copyright holder is the entity that employed, instructed, or directed those workers.<br/><br/>So, banning copyright on AI generated works because they were &quot;not created by a human&quot; is not at all justified. A film studio owns the copyright on a movie, or a music labels owns the copyright on a song, even if those rights holders had absolutely no role in the material creation of the work. In a legitimate business arrangement, with a contract in place, who or what physically generated the work is not relevant to the legal status of copyright. All that matters is the contract specifying who or what is calling the shots, literally and metaphorically. <br/><br/>In the case of AI generated content, the &quot;workers&quot; are automated processes. The creator is the entity who initially set the wheels of creation in motion. That might be an individual person who wrote a prompt. Or it might be the company who employs the person who wrote the prompt. Any way you look at it, the software that generated the content is not the creator. This may not be intuitively obvious to laypersons, but I expected a much more nuanced understanding from the government officials entrusted with ensuring a fair and open society. My suspicion is that the current regulations were created in order to mollify rights holders who reasonably feel threatened by these new developments.<br/><br/>The idea that a non-human cannot hold copyright does not withstand scrutiny, because the law has enabled the creation of virtual persons in the form of corporations. Corporations enjoy many of the benefits of legal personhood, while conveniently shielding real persons from liability. If an abstract legal construct such as a corporation can hold copyright, does it make any sense that a digital construct such as an algorithm cannot hold copyright? At the very least, if algorithms are not legal persons, then copyright should be reasonably held by the legal persons who created, trained, and/or directed the algorithm.<br/><br/>Totally autonomous AI systems do exist, but even in that case, they did not spring into the universe ex nihilo. Someone developed the system. For autonomous AI, the rights holders should be the legal persons who developed the software, or the holders of the rights to the content upon which the system was trained, or both. <br/><br/>In the case of non-autonomous AI, such as prompt-based content generators, the current regulations seem to willfully ignore the creative role of human beings who give direct instructions to AI systems. These text, image, and sound generators cannot do anything without human input. In this case, the creative act is suffused and difficult to identity. It&#39;s spread out among the developing entities, the creators of the training data, and the end user who wrote the prompt. But if the copyright has to go to only one entity, the logical choice is the prompt writer. They have selected particular outcomes from the latent space of the training data. It&#39;s not a passive process. If our government officials had any meaningful experience with AI content generators, they might recognize that the process requires human skill and effort to accomplish anything at all. Again, the content does not come from nowhere, it comes from the combined efforts of software developers, submitters of training data (willing or unwilling), and end users.<br/><br/>If I write line of code, or a haiku, or a listicle, I can copyright that. But if I feed that text into an image generator and create a unique work, the output cannot be copyrighted. But if I then load this generated image into an editing program such as Photoshop and change anything at all, even one pixel, suddenly I can copyright the image. Even though there is no effective difference, the edited image is legally different. I fail to see how that makes any sense at all. I set the wheels of creation in motion. I used the tool of AI to create something. <br/><br/>AI is not some scary magical force that operates beyond human understanding. It&#39;s just a tool, like Photoshop, or a digital audio workstation, or a word processor. And, of course, all of those tools currently incorporate AI functions. So if you&#39;re going to base copyright on these super shaky grounds, be prepared for big legal problems down the road. Fix the inherent self-contradictions in the regulations and bring them into alignment with all of the legal precedents set over the past couple of centuries. Thank you.
