Thank you for opening this matter up for public input. I&#39;m an artist and a writer, as well as friends and coworkers with other artists and writers, and I&#39;m deeply concerned about the use of my copyrighted material by AI generators without any compensation or even notification. I&#39;ve seen AI compared to digital art tools like Photoshop, or analog tools like cameras, but the difference is that you can&#39;t feed a million images into Photoshop, tell it to draw something, and have it give you something in return without any further input. AI is more than just a tool to make things, it encompasses the entire creative process. The very nature of it is entirely new and entirely different, and rulings on it shouldn&#39;t be made without considering this or the future implications of it. Already, creative people are afraid that AI will take over their jobs or push them out of the market. During the recent writer&#39;s and actor&#39;s strikes, the studios have put out job requests for AI wranglers, making clear what their eventual plan is - to use AI to muscle out anyone who wants fair compensation for their work. That artist&#39;s copyrighted work was used, without notice or compensation, to create something without their consent that will be used to replace them, is deeply unfair and unsustainable. As human output is reduced and devalued, the AI will begin feeding on itself, creating destructive recursive loops. This situation concerns me deeply, and I am hoping for rulings on copyright that can return control of their work to the artists and that will clearly delineate what is and isn&#39;t made by AI, and disallow the copyright of anything created by AI. Thank you for hearing me out on this matter.
