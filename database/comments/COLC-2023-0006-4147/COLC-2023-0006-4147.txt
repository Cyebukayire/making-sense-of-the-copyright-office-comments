I think you guys should vote against or rule against or whatever it is you do to make a motion against the idea that AI generated material can be copyrighted. First of all, AI material often borrows and scrapes its content from other sources so that is a direct violation of fair use as well as theft from other people&#39;s copyrighted materials. Second of all, I think that the hardworking people of SAG-AFTRA deserve to win their strike and for Disney to get hit with the biggest antitrust lawsuit of all time and this action would make it so no studio will be able to use AI generated materials in their works. Art is made by people, not robots, and I refuse to have it taken away from us.
