Generative AI can be helpful in the right hands, but it has wrecked havoc and devastation across the creative landscape. Generative AI technologies rely on feeding human input into the machine so that it can be duplicated and redistributed without any regards to the original creator. It takes away an artist&rsquo;s identity and makes creation nameless, faceless, and meaningless. <br/>If Generative AI is allowed to continue without any regulation or laws, it will devastate every industry and lead to immense unemployment, political, social, and scientific misinformation, and destroy the fabric of the economy while only enriching those that created the programs themselves.<br/>Consider and remember that the global economy is built on hard working Human Beings. Computers should only be tools to help humans make their jobs more efficient and rewarding. Generative AI aims to replace humans entirely- the fabric and backbone of society is humanity. Not machines.
