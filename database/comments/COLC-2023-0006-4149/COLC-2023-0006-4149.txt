As a citizen of the United States, I am very concerned about the copyright and writing implications of ChatGPT and other forms of machine learning. Already, we&#39;re seeing forgeries, fake authors, and writing is being stolen from those who worked extremely hard. ChatGPT using insane amounts of water, water that should be going into the homes of our citizens. The United States government urgently needs to put sensible restrictions on the reach of &quot;AI&quot; to prevent copyright violation and firther harm, especially to academia.
