Look. The country is on fire, and I feel powerless to fix anything. The only thing that keeps me going is escapism.<br/><br/>By allowing algorithmic plagiarism to continue, you are allowing the artists I love to be chased out of health and home.<br/><br/>I do not deny that there are legitimate legal uses for these algorithms, like stylistic imitation of works that have fallen into the public domain. However, these cases are niche in the current market, dominated by low quality and often horribly bigoted knockoffs.<br/><br/>The US Copyright Office is in an excellent position to address some of these issues. Not only are they your purview, but US copyright laws tend to be widely adopted and adapted on a global scale.
