I am a fan of technology and what it can do.  I&#39;ve worked for online education systems for more than a decade, for instance.  However, I believe that the use of artificial intelligence is spreading rapidly in ways that disregard ethics and responsibility.  Some of these uses are potentially and actually damaging to careers, intellectual property rights, and the existence of an informed society.  For instance, the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike has shown that the AMPTP considers it reasonable to pay performers for a single day&#39;s work and then to use AI to avoid hiring them ever again, while using and manipulating their work in perpetuity without compensation, including for uses far removed from those that the performers consented to.  Translators who provide advanced expertise and cultural understanding in their translations are replaced by &quot;good enough&quot; AI-based translations, and then actual translators may be asked to &quot;check it&quot; (which requires doing the entire job all over) for a small fraction of the income.<br/><br/>Platforms like Zoom are sneaking into updated Terms of Service that literally anything you do on their (well-established) platform is free-game to &quot;train&quot; their AI -- in other words, it belongs to them and they can churn your work out to others.  This is incredibly dangerous for privacy and the intellectual property of both individuals and businesses who use the platforms for confidential work, or even who don&#39;t want to see others stealing their efforts without credit. (Right now, consumers can switch to different platforms, but those other platforms are likely to follow suit if Zoom is able to do this.)  The fact that AI-training programs also scrape archives of fiction websites has similar ethical problems, with issues including harming creativity, demoralizing creatives, and inserting fictional information into &quot;factual&quot; output -- which HAS happened!  As many memes have stated, the goal was for technology to replace the rote work so that humans were free to be creative and pursue passions, not for technology to take over the art and fiction so that we have more time to do grunt work.<br/><br/>I mentioned that I work in online education; as a former high-school teacher, I&#39;m extremely familiar with how challenging information literacy can be and how technology increases that difficulty.  Ideally, we would all get MUCH better at this skill!  However, the ways that Google and the internet have increased the likelihood of using a poor source or being confident about a wrong answer can be greatly exacerbated by an AI that &quot;presents itself&quot; as an unassailable expert on all fields, especially since these tools don&#39;t use direct sourcing, so the ultimate sources (the data they were trained on) are deeply hidden.  This assumption of expertise also makes it less likely that people will think critically about what they&#39;re given, thus reducing the effort put into maintaining our own, individual information literacy.  We&#39;ve seen ChatGPT confidently make mistakes in simple math problems -- which theoretically is what computer algorithms are **best** at -- and we&#39;ve seen informational quests go terribly wrong.  This and other tools will readily make up quotes attributed to people who never said those things; it will acknowledge that the quotes are fictional, but only if you have the understanding to specifically ask follow-up questions, which most people won&#39;t.  Finally, research has shown that artificial intelligence systems often replicate and deepen existing bias and inequities; for instance, a resume-sifting AI program may throw out resumes with degrees from HBCUs, because their training data showed that people with degrees from these universities are less likely to already have jobs like the ones being considered.<br/><br/>Like most technologies, artificial intelligence isn&#39;t inherently bad.  I think it has interesting potential in a number of fields, and I believe it can increase efficiency, effectiveness, informational content, and possibilities in many contexts.  However, there are many, many ways in which it can go wrong, with consequences that range from eye-rolling to devastating, both for individuals and for broader society.  Moreover, the current boom in AI neglects ethics and responsibility, especially but not only in the protection of intellectual property (both formal and informal).  Significant regulation is required to protect creators, workers, and consumers from misused AI and from development as a cash-grab.
