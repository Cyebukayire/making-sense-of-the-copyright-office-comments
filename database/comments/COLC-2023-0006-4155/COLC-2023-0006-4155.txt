The central and most obvious issue of generative AI when it comes to copyright law is that all Large Language Model (LLM) systems, by design, are derivative works of the humans that created the content that feeds these models. These systems cannot be disconnected from the human component, as has been demonstrated when systems like ChatGPT lose fidelity when connected to other machine-generated content. Which is to say, no LLM can function effectively without relying upon the copyrightable works of human creators.<br/><br/>The fundamental issue with this dependency is almost every LLM uses the copyrightable works of human content creators without permission. Companies like OpenAI have made no effort to seek approval from content creators as they likely assumed such an endeavor was too daunting due to the massive volume of content used to feed their LLMs. However, that is not the problem of the content creators. **Just because a system is able to plagiarize on a massively aggregated scale does not make the plagiarism acceptable.**<br/><br/>Thus for the purposes of the copyright office, I think there should be some pretty straightforward rules when it comes to AI/LLM-generated content:<br/>1. Does the petitioner own the LLM used to produce the work in question?<br/>2. Can the petitioner provide the relevant sources used in developing the LLM?<br/>3. Can the petitioner prove they have the necessary fair use licenses/approval of the creators of the copyrightable materials that was used to train the LLM and produce the work?<br/><br/>If the answer is no to any of these questions, the work in question is a derivative product without the appropriate licensing of the original content creators, and is therefore NOT copyrightable.<br/><br/>Additionally, I strongly encourage the U.S. Copyright Office to consider the gross violation of licensing in the development of LLMs to begin with, and holding the companies/creators of such systems accountable. We are in an era where generative AI/LLMs stand to be highly profitable ventures, relying on the skill and talent of human content creators without appropriate compensation or--more importantly--authorization of said creators. While mimicking another creator&#39;s artistic style is certainly largely acceptable under copyright law, LLMs function differently. They wholly ingest copyrightable material and combine it with other copyrightable material to produce an &quot;original&quot; product that appears sufficiently separated from the source material but is, in fact, impossible to generate without said material. In practice, this is not much different from an author copy-pasting passages from multiple novels into a new novel and claiming the work as their own. Additionally, not only do these systems copy other people&#39;s work and pass it off as their own, they are directly threatening the jobs and employment opportunities of those humans whose copyrightable material they wrongfully appropriated.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
