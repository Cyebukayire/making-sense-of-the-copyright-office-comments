The theft of creations (such as but not limited to illustrations) is a disgrace that cannot be allowed to be normalized and needs to be regulated. There&#39;s enough cruelty and misgiving in the world, let&#39;s not add to it by throwing away basic decency. <br/><br/>I&#39;ve seen people who disregard the idea of practice or self improvement on the basis of &ldquo;it would be easier to type in a description&rdquo;. I&#39;ve seen people who insist their autogenerated illustrations to be equal to, if not better than manually made art on the basis of &ldquo;I still &lsquo;made&rsquo; it&rdquo;. How many people will disregard artistic talent and the nurturance thereof and how long would it be before we as a culture and country slip to the full forfeit of this avenue of humanity? <br/><br/>Regarding computer generated illustrations of voices and faces, regulations would need to be even more vigorous so as to nor boil down a person to a mere commodity. The performance of the actor is a form of labour, something made and done as part of a larger piece. A person&#39;s likeness and voice cannot be so easily auctioned off unless we as a society presume human beings to be no different from fictional characters or clothing on a rack. <br/><br/>Returning to AI art, existing copyrights are being routinely ignored and refused by the programmer and consumer alike. It has come to the point that many, ignorant, crude, or both, will take up the works of those they respect, throw them into a generator to churn out a simulated product, then present it to the original artist in a tactless display of presumed nonchalance. Do you have any idea how disparaging that is? How disturbing to think that some people think theft can be made into a joke or compliment? I nearly removed my work from public eyes out of the sickly feeling that someone unknown might come and claim my craft by simple virtue of its existence.
