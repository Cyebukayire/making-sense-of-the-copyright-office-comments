I believe that AI has the potential to do a great deal of damage to creative fields if its output is allowed to exist unrestricted. As someone with aspirations of writing, the fact that such programs are set to flood the market, fueled by the works of others and even potentially my own, is very disheartening. Further, minimal artistry goes into AI while it relies greatly on the art of others for its output. The AI does not &quot;make decisions&quot; per say, it makes a purely mathematical attempt to replicate. <br/><br/>In summary, I emphatically oppose it being recognized as copyrightable on any capacity
