As an artist in her midtwenties- who has practiced her craft since the age of 4, it is so inexplicably disheartening to see not only my own work, but the work of millions of others be fed through an algorithm and spat out into something I have no creative or legal say in. <br/>Years of practice and honing my craft, wasted. <br/>My income has been effected as well. When approaching a client with what I believe to be fair prices for my hard work and labor, I am met with an indignant &quot;Well I can just generate an AI image for free&quot;. <br/>The Historical, and cultural, significance of art is in danger. If we allow big corporations to use AI image/writing generators, we allow real people to starve and be without work. The point of the USA was to be &quot;the land of opportunities&quot;, but time and time again, the government has snuffed and starved out artists all for selfish gain. <br/>Do not allow artistic labor to become slave labor.
