Works created via a sufficiently advanced generative A.I. might be misperceived as creative and expressive pieces by its audience, but there can be no creativity or expressive intent performed by non-sentient software. Furthermore, all generative A.I. models are trained via the consumption of staggeringly massive amounts of copyrighted material without the permission of, credit offered, or payment to the original copyright holders. <br/><br/>As such...not only are any works created via generative A.I. unworthy of the protections of copyright under the law, they should (by their very nature) be considered active copyright violations.
