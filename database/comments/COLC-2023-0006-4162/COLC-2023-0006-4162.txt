As a researcher in grad school who works with algorithms, it&#39;s startling to me to see claims that algorithmically generated work like that created by new &quot;AI&quot; algorithms could be protected under copyright. These algorithmically created works are not ideas and I feel like the point of copyright is to protect ideas. An algorithm does not think like a human can. Irregardless of your thoughts on that specific matter, if algorithmically generated work could be copyrighted, I would be concerned about the results of that decision. There would be nothing from stopping companies from or individuals from producing content en masse and submitting it for a copyright. These algorithms could spit out billions of works a year, flooding the system, and making it impossible for anybody else to get copyright on any of their works. If billions of stories, scripts, and images created by algorithms were to flood the copyright system, almost anything anybody could do would be made already. A genuine person attempting to copyright a photograph or short story would find that a similar enough work had already been submitted, simply by algorithmic chance.
