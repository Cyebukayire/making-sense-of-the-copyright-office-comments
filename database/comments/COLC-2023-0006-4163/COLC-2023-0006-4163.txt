I&#39;m worried about the impact AI will have overall. I&#39;m sure many others will reference its impact on jobs and the like. I&#39;m worried about the ease of spreading misinformation with AI. There&#39;s already an influx of false information spreading throughout the internet however, with AI it makes it SO much easier. &quot;Nudes&quot; of people going public which are made with AI, the inability for anyone to Google an image looking for &#39;paintings by Van Gogh&#39; and being shown only AI-generated lookalikes, finding an audio file of a celebrity making a hate-speech that they never said, are just a handful of examples. Soon enough, we won&#39;t be able to trust anything that we see online. Without some kind of cap, what happens &#39;reality&#39;? Will kids have to grow up only knowing fake images of historic artists, landscapes that we&#39;re told are from foreign places but are of made-up fantasies? Right now it&#39;s still in a learning period where if you&#39;ve got a good eye you can tell when something&#39;s made with AI but I&#39;m sure that window of time is fast closing in. <br/><br/>I agree with other complaints about AI, the taking away jobs, the fact that companies will use it as an excuse to underpay creators, and others like it. But as someone who just uses the internet passively, every single day, I&#39;m worried about clicking into any website, any search engine, and being unable to figure out what&#39;s made by a human or what&#39;s made by an AI. Though misinformation in the form of articles/images/etc is spread by people of course, I think AI will bring an influx that will be simply unmanageable. I don&#39;t want to look at any image, article, video, or audio file and have to try to guess if it&#39;s AI or not. I want there to be a limit on what AI is allowed to do. If we don&#39;t start putting limits on it NOW while it&#39;s still in its beginning stages, I fear what we will all have to deal with in only a short amount of time. The wave of AI is coming whether or not we regulate it. I would feel safer knowing that there is something being done to limit its impact.
