I believe the following about AI works:<br/>- Any work created from AI datasets should not be copyrightable. AI is incapable of true thought.<br/>- All works should be opt-in in regards to training. An author should make an informed and active decision to allow their works to be used in such a manner, otherwise it shall constitute theft.<br/>- Responsibility for copyrighted works being included in a training set should be carried by the entities creating and hosting the AI. Either users of this AI should not have the option to submit works into a database for training, or the entity creating and hosting the AI shall bear the financial reparations of allowing users to upload copyrighted materials.
