AI is a tool that needs to be used carefully. You would not give a toddler a power drill, and in the same sense, you should only allow AI to be used by those experienced enough to do so. Misuse of AI has already directly impacted writers, artists, actors, and all other forms of media. Everything &#39;created&#39; by an AI is stolen from others. AI does not create, it compiles from stolen sources, and therefore cannot claim a copyright. Art, writing, and other forms of art are unique because of the humanity behind them.  There is nothing but lies and disgraceful practices behind AI creations. Until AI is truly sentient and can create its own thoughts, the works it creates have no merit. True artificial intelligence should be able to create and have their works copyrighted, but the poor facsimiles we work with today are not true intelligence. Until technology advances to a point where an artificial intelligence can create truly original pieces, AI should be heavily moderated and uncopyrightable.
