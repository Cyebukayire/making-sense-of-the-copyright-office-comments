AI and machine learning needs an opt-in and payment feature for artists and writers who could provide content for it. Otherwise, it is stealing from copyright materials on a massive scale to generate content that is derivative of said stolen work. Legislation is needed to examine the content that has already been fed into large AI models (OpenAI, DeepAI, ChatGPT) and the potential to force companies to delete the machine learning modules already trained on said copyrights - or large scale lawsuits are likely to occur.
