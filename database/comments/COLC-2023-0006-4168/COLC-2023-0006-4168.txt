Previously did a short form documentary about AI after a brief investigation as to how AI data sets are formed. Long story short, one group makes a data set, someone else makes another dataset to match that dataset to images pulled randomly from the internet, and matched with certain terms before getting loaded into the AI. But the problem with these robots is that they need to be taught information AND context. A lot of these bots are getting put in the world without knowledge of context or laws, and blatantly violating copyrite in the process. As it currently stands, the computer science community says that we&#39;re at a level 3 for AI intelligence. Level 3 means it can solve complex problems-- it&#39;s just that robots don&#39;t know about context. Until the ability to recognize context and nuance is achieved, I personally don&#39;t think AI technology should be so widely available for commercial use, and if it is used in commercial contexts it should be a VERY special exception. I don&#39;t want copyright laws expanded, I just want this tool to have the time necessary to develop properly as a lot of CS enthusiasts do. It&#39;s just, bottom line, not ready.
