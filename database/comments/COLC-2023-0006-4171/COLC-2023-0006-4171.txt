I am very against artificial intelligence in any artistic capacity, so I support not allowing work involving AI to be copyrighted. Creativity is a trait HUMANS have, not computer programs. Plus, an overwhelming majority of the work AI can produce is based off of works created by real people who did not consent to having their work fed to an algorithm. Please continue to support REAL art, not a product with no thought.
