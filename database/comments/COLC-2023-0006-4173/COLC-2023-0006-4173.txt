I think there should be NO copyright on AI generated images, because;<br/>1- After all, it is not a totally human creation and<br/>2- The result, at the end of the day, is based on the work and creations of people other than those who claim it is &quot;his&quot; creation, generated by a machine and a series of calculations based on images of other people. So in any case, it would be a &quot;creation&quot; of the mixture of the work of many people, from whom, in addition, part of their original creation is being stolen.
