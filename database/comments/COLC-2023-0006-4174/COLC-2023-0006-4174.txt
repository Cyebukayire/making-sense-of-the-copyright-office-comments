AI is largely created by scraping the internet of content created by people and using this to make its own content.  This is intellectual theft of artistic works.  It has the potential to destroy the livelihood of many Americans who freelance art, fiction, writing, and much more.  It can create potentially damaging photorealistic work, by mimicking real photography.  It has already been used to simulate nude pictures of people, without their consent, and photographs of animals which are not accurate and could lead to misidentification.  It&#39;s been used as a substitute for human interaction in places where human empathy and the ability to critically think are vital, such as suicide holiness, to detrimental effect.  In many places, the attempt to cut costs by using AI is damaging livelihood and deteriorating job markets.  AI is also not free from bias, as it learns off of largely white, male-dominated software companies.  The inability for AI to recognize black faces is studied and notable.  In cases of so called &#39;predictive&#39; AI attempting to determine if someone is likely to commit or reoffended a crime, the prediction is notably higher for black and Latino because they are ARRESTED at a higher rate than most people, not because they are more likely to commit a crime.  In short, AI may have some benefits but it needs to be HIGHLY regulated.
