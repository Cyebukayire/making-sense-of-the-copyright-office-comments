AI art needs to be regulated into only using media (photo, video, audio, writing, art, etc) that has been approved by original entity of creation for AI sampling. Any and all AI that use copyrighted pictures that have not been approved by the original creator/copyright holder SPECIFICALLY for AI art should not be able to be used. Grandfathering images in based on unchanged Terms of Service that does not explicitly state AI use consent is mandatory (when consulting TOS of any image-based website) should not be considered consent for AI use.
