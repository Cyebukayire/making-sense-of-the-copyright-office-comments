Ai cannot hold copyright for art or anything else for that matter. The reasoning is very straightforward once you think about what these programs are doing in their most basic functions. When an AI program is presenting a user with art where does it get the building blocks for its output? The internet. These algorithms, have to be shown images of other people&rsquo;s creations to have any idea of what a user is asking it for. When these things are being taught they aren&rsquo;t learning basic art theory or how to draw, paint, etc., they are being fed the things we go to museums to see, drawings posted on social media, pictures of actors, and movie stills. What these AI produced works really are, is collages made entirely of copywritten work. The work will never be transformative enough, or original in such a way that anyone couldn&rsquo;t successfully argue a case for plagiarism. Even now there are people using AI to try to make book covers and getting end results with images of famous people. Certainly the person appearing in the work didn&rsquo;t authorize use of their likeness and the person who took the photo didn&rsquo;t license it out to be used in such a way. Just because you can&rsquo;t arrest or fine a program for blatantly copying and profiting off someone else&rsquo;s hard work doesn&rsquo;t make it right. There&rsquo;s a huge difference between drawing some alien world you saw in draw in dream and taking a bunch of you didn&rsquo;t ask to use, throwing something together and passing the result off as an entirely original work created from scratch.
