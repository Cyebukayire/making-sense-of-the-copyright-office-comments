Content created using &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; is built upon mass theft of copyrighted works that are not meant to be stock images for a machine to recombine and output. It is not created by a person, it is not a work of art. It shouldn&#39;t be given any copyright protection at all. The technology is built around the desire to cut workers out of the creative industry after having scraped all the years of our work off of the internet without our knowledge or consent. Artists deserve protection. People typing a phrase into a machine that gives them a random result are not artists and are not participating in a creative process. They shouldn&#39;t be given copyright on the output of an algorithm.
