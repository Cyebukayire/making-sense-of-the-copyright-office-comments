AI, particularly as it relates to the art disciplines, is being wielded as a tool not for creativity but for exploitation. AI users are far from regulated &ndash; they take or &quot;scrape&quot; creative works of digital and traditional artists to &quot;train&quot; programs, but virtually no discipline on their part is called for. There is no direct human direction in the process of what is created, only finished works tossed into a machine, while the AI &quot;artist&quot; waits at the end of the chute to see whatever comes out. The lack of consent, care, and compensation make this an abhorrent practice that is a worrying hallmark of modern America: exploitation and even glee in the face of worker distress. The artists whose education and industry experience are exploited without permission or payment are not slackers &ndash; quite the opposite. So why are their issues being so scorned and disregarded? Are hard work, authenticity, and true individuality no longer aspirational? The lack of firm and persisting regulation harms not only the workers who have built up a financially and culturally significant body of modern art; it harms the reputation and efficacy of AI&#39;s emergent technology. If clear and enforced regulations protect artists and their work, the fear and revulsion for AI decreases dramatically. Otherwise, aggression towards anything related to AI, instability and delays within the industry and its related cohort (ex: publishing, film/TV), and growing resentment toward legislative inaction can only escalate. Hopefully someone who cares takes this seriously &ndash; thanks for your time.
