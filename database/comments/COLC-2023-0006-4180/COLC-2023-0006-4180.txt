AI generation has been used as a tool for scams, thievery, and misinformation. AI&#39;s writting books that get sold under the name of an author who did not write them, AI&#39;s copying artwork to be sold or circumvent paying the actual artist, AI&#39;s making up facts which get regurgitated onto websites displaying them as if they were true. AI needs regulation to protect both consumers and workers. Deepfaking people, both living and dead, is also disgusting and rife for abuse.
