AI will destroy jobs, market, and human will and connection. The mere existence of it threatens the structure of society itself- sharing art, music and writing, connecting over social service jobs and needs, etc. AI should not be allowed to bypass copyright laws that do a huge disservice to past, present, and future artists/workers. AKA-Let people paint, draw, and collage the way we have been for centuries. Leave the robots out of it
