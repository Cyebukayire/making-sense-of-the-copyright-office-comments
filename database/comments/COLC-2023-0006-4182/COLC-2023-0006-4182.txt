Artificial intelligence is developing at a rapid pace, but is being more rapidly marketed towards consumers by companies adding AI features and tools. It may be that this version of AI we have (in the form of text and image generators) will collapse, but it does not solve the issue at hand with its further development and implementation. AI relies on scraping the work of others, many who have not willingly consented for their work to be scraped off of the internet and used to train AI. Artists particularly have trouble when someone trains an AI to their artistic style and then either impersonates the individual or sells their AI pieces. Writing faces similar issues, as some users are printing AI generated novels and posting them under the name of popular authors. It would support my interests as an aspiring writer, and those of the general population of the United States, to have these technologies face more regulation and clearer copyright boundaries. Books and art generated using AI could be considered public domain works, therefore keeping AI as a tool to be used, but protecting the rights of other creators suffering from impersonators, as well as their works being unfairly used in AI training models. This may be an imperfect solution, but any regulation for AI works is welcome, so that all are fairly compensated and recognized for the work they&rsquo;ve done, and those strictly using AI cannot unfairly take advantage.
