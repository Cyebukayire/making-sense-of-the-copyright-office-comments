Hi! I am writing in as an animator and as an artist, because I am concerned about the encroachment of AI and generative programs on copyright and creative livelihoods of artists.<br/><br/>Because of the lack of regulation in the AI field, there have been many cases of unethical usage of AI as a tool to threaten people&#39;s jobs and to violate the original copyright holders rights to their own work. The voices and likenesses of individuals have been furthermore suggested by studios to be put into databases, to be used in perpetuity.<br/>The vast majority of AI generated images and text are furthermore, trained on databases of work scraped from the internet, and the original creators of that work will likely never see any monetary recompense for their stolen work.<br/><br/>AI&#39;s continued unregulated status shows itself to be a threat to all realms of previously established copyright, and it places the jobs of the people who rely on that copyright under threat. I strongly urge Congress to review this issue, and to consider legislation to protect creatives and actors alike.
