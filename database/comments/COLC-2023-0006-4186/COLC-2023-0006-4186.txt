I believe that AI should not be available for copyright as the written or produced work is pulled from other, already copyrighted content. It is in no way original and at this time, no residuals, credit or compensation is given to the creator(s) that the new AI work is based off of. While it&#39;s natural for any human creator to pull from existing stories/content to get ideas for their own, they must credit a copyright holder if their creation impedes an established copyright. Additionally, and artist can outright state, &quot;this movie was my inspiration for the color palette&quot; or something similar.  AI can not say the same thing. There is, currently, no way for the AI tech to say what it pulled from in order to create the desired prompt. This essentially means that the creators have created a machine but have no idea how it does what it does. AI is being used by companies to devalue and underpay actual creators, artists and writers as way to circumvent not just creativity but value of labor.
