I believe AI generated &quot;Artwork&quot; signals tragedy for all creative industries. I suggest that AI generated materials should be public domain, as no specific party will have created it. If that&#39;s not possible, I suggest that if a party is trying to copyright AI generated material, it has to be generated using artwork that the party already owns. For example, Disney can copyright AI artwork if that AI used other Disney artwork to generate.
