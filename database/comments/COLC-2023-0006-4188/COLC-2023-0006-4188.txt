Please make regulations regarding &quot;creative&quot; Artificial Intelligence. All these programs are doing is stealing preexisting copyrighted work and combining it into something new. No artists, musicians, voice actors, or writers are consenting to have their works stolen like this. These programs are taking away opportunities and financial stability from hard working Americans. Do not let corporations influence the legislation that must be made for Artificial Intelligence
