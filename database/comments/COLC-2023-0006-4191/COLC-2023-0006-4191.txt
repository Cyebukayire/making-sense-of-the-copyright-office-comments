The use of AI is very concerning and should be heavily regulated in regards to copyrighted work. AI is trained to &lsquo;create&rsquo; based off input from actual human works of art, writing, etc., and therefore the things that ai is making is inherently plagiarism. AI should not be allowed to replace creative positions previously held by individuals, such as writing, illustrating, etc. and the use of AI should not be used to replace or compete with works made by people. While AI has its uses, it&rsquo;s place has not ever been in creative work, but instead to streamline the processes of actual human creators to make better working conditions for those creators. This is an issue that needs to be addressed quickly and effectively by policy before it becomes even more ingrained in our current processes.
