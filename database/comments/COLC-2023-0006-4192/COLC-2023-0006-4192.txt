Artificial Intelligence or AI software as it stands right now is not Artificial Intelligence. <br/><br/>Every version it so far is just a data-scraper that at the least concern, helps students and grant-writers not have to write their essays. But at the worst: it enables plagarism, art-theft, and provides blatantly false information. <br/>Public understanding of it is a mess because people want to trust it as a tool, and there have been otherwise qualified individuals who have attempted to use AI software to replace human effort. (Lawyers!) But there is virtually no fact-checking or crediting system in place. It will provide false citations that people trust instead of double-checking. This could threaten people with health concerns who consult with AI instead of going to a doctor because AI is a less expensive option. This has bearing on legal cases where false information is provided to sway the opinion of the jury or judge. <br/><br/>On top of it all, profit-focused executives want to utilize it to replace human labor when it absolutely is not in a state to be applied as such. This is threatening the work as it stands of Actors, Writers, and Artists. We should be excited about technological advancements because they should enable us to pursue our passions and happiness. But instead we are looking at a future where AI replaces the labor of passion-driven professionals (Doctors! Legal professionals too!) <br/><br/>AI is also trained as a data-scraper and is replicating it&#39;s own images and the result is the reinforcement of stereotypes. If you ask an image-creation AI tool to show an &quot;autistic person&quot; it will produce almost nothing but unhappy, expressionless white men or boys. We genuinely need to regulate and bar the use of this in informational searches, schools, legal fields, medical fields, and art fields or it is going to set the progress we have made in literacy, technology, and socially back by decades.
