Work generated by AI should not be considered copyrightable for a variety of reasons:<br/> <br/>1) Copyright is designed to protect the human beings that create art. Generative AI is doing the opposite, being used to replace artists, writers, and other creatives. This has already been documented as happening, and will only get worse if AI work is copyrightable. The use of AI is an existential threat for people in all creative fields from writing to acting to design of all sorts.  <br/><br/>2) While the use of tools such as typewriters, word processing programs, or digital art programs do not stop a work from being copyrightable, AI Is a tool of a completely different source. A person must still make the decisions about placements of words in a book if they type it or write it. An artist must still place their lines. AI makes those decisions for the individual based on prompts. <br/><br/>3) Most AI is trained (at least in part) off of stolen material. Large databases scrape countless books, websites, and other sources either on their own or by having users input this data into the systems. They are plagiarism machines masquerading as creativity. They cannot make anything new, they only search what they are given and compile this information into the most likely desired response. <br/><br/>AI work should not be copyrightable. It requires theft on a large scale to work and seeks to replace creatives, and it should not be protected by laws designed to help the people that big businesses would have it destroy.
