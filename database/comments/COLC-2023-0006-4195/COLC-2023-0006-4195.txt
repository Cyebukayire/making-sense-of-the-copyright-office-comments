I am a technology professional also performing as a children&#39;s illustration and character artist under the pen name and web domain alzamon.com. Artificial intelligence, which has actually been decades in the making, is often called these days &quot;progress&quot;, &quot;evolution&quot; and &quot;unavoidable&quot; and in many fields including healthcare, space explorations, language learning and automatization of menial, dead-end jobs it is making meaningful, positive impact. But when it is used under the pretense of replacing creative professionals to save money, which is why Hollywood&#39;s WGA/SAG strike is happening and millions of artists around the world raise their voices in protest, and/or to trespass boundaries defined by IP / copyright laws and conventions around the world, like data scrappers siphoning publicly available data to feed and train AI datasets without any regards to owner&#39;s copyright, intellectual property and without any proper compensation as is expected from the current system in use, then it is evident this cannot continue in free, Wild West fashion, in a system where technologies advance leaps and bounds faster than laws.<br/><br/>Specially for those of us who are overseas creators but project our creations and market to a global audience including the U.S, the thought of not feeling completely safe sharing our work, our content through the Internet without it being potentially scrapped by AI bots for third party benefit, and without any legal protection backing, is an uneasy one. Social media promotion is often the only accesible channel to artists who don&#39;t have big promotion budgets or marketing teams behind them, and there is the feeling that social media companies aren&#39;t doing enough, or care much about, the impact of AI upon their dependence of small and mid-sized individuals and companies as a promotion vehicle to their audiences.<br/><br/>Unlike the 20th century transition from buggy whips to automobile technology which some AI pundits compare the current situation to, what pretends to be replaced here isn&#39;t just mechanics &mdash; but every process, physical or mental, associated to the human condition, for the benefit of the wealthiest 1% of society. Humans are the only creatures who consciously create and make art, which isn&#39;t just an act of visually or aurally representing something, but also something that is intrinsic to the human condition, since the prehistoric cave paintings. It&#39;s part of what we are and will forever be. Under the most vicious versions of capitalism, everything that can be turned into merchandise will so be, and generative AI&#39;s appropriation of artists&#39; work without consent, being reprocessed and repackaged at a risible cost by companies making millions of dollars off what cannot be named other than high-tech theft goes hand in hand with the most dystopian of societal scenarios. Pre-AI, it was already hard for millions of artists around the world to make a living, and if the current AI trend continues without establishing fair regulations and compensations acknowledging the importance of human creative input, art making will become downright untenable as a career, and a society where art and creativity aren&#39;t possible is a society doomed to its own self-provoked failure. It just takes a quick scan of the opinions of thousands of visual artists, musicians, performers, voice actors, animators and others who make art for a living to attest the importance of realizing that, while machines have been and can keep being useful to the advancement of our societies, they can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be prioritized over the wants, needs and desires of humans.
