I am a writer recently admitted into the WGA and I am very concerned that the use of AI is already abolishing the profession I have worked twenty years to become a part of. What has always upheld that work is that the stories and works we create in this business are copyrightable and therefore protected from those who would exploit them without compensation to those that spent the hours and applied skills to create them. The creators of these AI programs should not be able to feed our copyrighted works into them freely to train their programs without our permission or consent. That is criminal. If they want to use our works they should have to attain them legally through contracts and compensation. Any works created by these AI programs should not be copyrightable as they feed upon the work of others and therefore the generated AI works are actually the work of millions of artists who are not being compensated. So essentially, the AI creators are being given free rein to ripoff everyone and anyone under the guise that it would be too difficult to disseminate who the AI is stealing from as it&#39;s everyone. That&#39;s why AI generated art and writing needs to be deemed not copyrightable. AI is a cheat for monopolies and large businesses to plagiarize the individual artists and writers of the world without having to compensate nor seek permission of their usage. It&#39;s unethical and criminal and we need serious guardrails to protect the artists and writers who create their own works.
