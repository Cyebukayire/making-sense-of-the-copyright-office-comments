As is, AI is woefully unregulated in what it can and cannot do, to say nothing of the fact that what we have presently, as I understand it, falls woefully short of being any kind of actual intelligence. But what we have is what we have.<br/><br/>To that end, most of the stuff being made on AI models that involves copyrightable stuff in concept (art, writing,etc) is also largely fed the work of various creators without their knowledge or consent, to no benefit of these original creators in the least. we already have laws in place in regards to derivative works, and if you&#39;re going to build something off of someone elses work they should be compensated for it, in addition to having your works protected from being used barring some kind of personal contract with clear explicit terms that aren&#39;t buried somewhere in say the terms of service as we&#39;ve seen pop up in several places.<br/><br/>Just in general, AI stuff is going to need regulation if you&#39;re going to protect the works of actual living breathing people, as opposed to a machine that very literally is not intelligent and cannot think.
