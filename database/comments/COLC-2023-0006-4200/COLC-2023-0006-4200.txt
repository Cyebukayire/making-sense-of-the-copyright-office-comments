AI steals from artists of all kinds to generate product that (thus far) is inferior and visibly AI generated. This violates copyright of authors, screenwriters, visual artists, and photographers. Should a human being be caught violating copyright, they&rsquo;d be stopped and possibly prosecuted. That AI isn&rsquo;t held to this same standard is impacting the artists being stolen from in multiple regards: profit the artists see none of is being made using their work without their permission, the job market is being filled by AI who do inferior work, and in addition to theft for training AI, there are AI systems accessible to the general public that allow for copyright infringement of visual artists and photographers by removing their watermarks and allowing humans to present the work as their own. Artists of all kinds are already undervalued (that AI is being implemented to replace them is the biggest indicator of that) and to allow this copyright infringement to continue is inexcusable.
