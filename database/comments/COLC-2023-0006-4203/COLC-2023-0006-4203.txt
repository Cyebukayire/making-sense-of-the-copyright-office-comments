I believe that Artificial Intelligence, or what it truly is, a machine learning tool, is not an author or artist in itself. Such a machine/device is neither the creative force behind the idea in a work of art or text, neither the individual responsible for the effort necessary to create a work of art or text. Often authorship in these cases is murky, as these machine learning tools must be trained on other human artists&rsquo; copyrighted efforts. Therefore the notion of copyright being granted to &ldquo;AI&rdquo; work is nonsensical. If a pencil was attached to a machinated arm and tasked with scribbling at random on a piece of paper, the creation of the tool is an achievement, but the work of art is not the pencil-robot&rsquo;s unique work with certain granted protections. Between the creative effort being divorced from human ingenuity and the tool itself often stealing or remixing existing protected works, &ldquo;AI&rdquo; should not be granted legitimate copyright privileges. Additionally, while the creators of the &ldquo;AI&rdquo; may be technologically creative or made a code-based or engineering-based effort, inputting commands into a system and getting a result does not a work of art make. There is no artist involved. Thank you for hearing out Americans on this timely and massively important issue.
