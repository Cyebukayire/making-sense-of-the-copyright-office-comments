Hi, my name is Chris Bickle and while I personally have not had any art stolen, I have a number of close friends who have found their art on AI sites and had to jump through a whole circus worth of hoops for nothing to happen, the site still has their art. AI has potential but I believe using it for any creation field i.e. art, writing, and the like is not only wrong for the mimicry but a waste of the overall potential of AI. We want humans to be creating art. We&rsquo;re telling stories not just mishmashing snippets from a million writer submissions.
