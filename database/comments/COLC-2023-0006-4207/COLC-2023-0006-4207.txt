As an artist working in the entertainment industry, generative AI is stealing my work with the express intent of putting me out of work. I have worked so hard at my craft for so many years, only to have it stolen to generate profits for some software company. It is WRONG and should absolutely be illegal to train AI systems on any works without express permission or payment to the original creators. These systems would simply not exist without us.
