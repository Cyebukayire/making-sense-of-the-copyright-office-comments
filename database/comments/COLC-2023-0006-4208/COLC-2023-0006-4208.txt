AI, and anything created by AI, should not be protected by copyright law in any way. Additionally, any creative work produced by an AI should not be able to be sold. AI takes from existing work, and does not generate new content. It can only create what it has taken from. It is not human, it is not sentient, and it isn&rsquo;t creating something off its own merits. It&rsquo;s theft to sell work based on other&rsquo;s efforts, and AI is no different. An emphasis is placed on an unwilling participant, as is the case for most AI programs - Including ChatGPT, Midjourney, or any AI generative content. The information being used to train these programs is not taken with consent. It is not fair use because it is not being transformed, and the end product should not be able to fall under copyright because it was not created by a human. AI should not be banned outright, but instead be restricted to prevent not receiving consent from the participants. Another example is AI voices being used to replicate real people, such as the President of the United States, Joe Biden, and Former President Donald Trump. These programs can generate voices virtually indistinguishable from both figures. Furthermore, these programs can make them say anything - Including treasonous content, confessions of crime, and other defamatory content, using their voices. The unregulated nature and lack of drawback for using non-consenting participants means that misinformation can be spread easier through the use of non-consenting, reliable figures.
