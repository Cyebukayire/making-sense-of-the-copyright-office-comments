AI is trained solely on works that it did not and could not produce on its own. If AI is allowed to copyright plagiarized materials, then the very concept of copyright can be called into question. Why do we have copyright if not to protect against the unlawful copy and distribution of works? If we&#39;re going to disregard those laws when it comes to AI, then all copyright should be dissolved and all works should be released into the public domain. If you will not hold computers accountable for the illegal use of copyrighted intellectual property, then none of us should be held accountable.
