A.I. seems, to me, to learn the same way humans do in the art field. It closely copies previous work until someone with some skill in its use improves it into the realm of unique. Sort of like Photoshop being a collection of tools that require someone to use properly. <br/><br/>I have no issue with AI so long as it blatantly doesn&#39;t steal directly from another artist: And I hold the same standard as a human there. Copying a style or a similar pose and angle is something done by every human artist ever.<br/><br/>I also find the idea of AI helpers both useful, but concerning. The more I look into it, the more I see the AI becoming less exact and powerful to appease big city sensibilities. I find that to be highly disturbing that someone that absolutely should be tuned with precision is being purposely co-opted.
