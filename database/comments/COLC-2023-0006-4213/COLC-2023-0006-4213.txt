I&#39;m commenting here on my thoughts on AI, especially it&#39;s usage in creating art ! I personally am against it as there has been rampant theft of artists&#39; creations in order to feed the AI, only made worse when it&#39;s done out of spite or with artists who cannot give their consent because they&#39;ve passed away. As an artist myself, I am terrified of my art being stolen and used without my permission in order to created AI &quot;art&quot;.
