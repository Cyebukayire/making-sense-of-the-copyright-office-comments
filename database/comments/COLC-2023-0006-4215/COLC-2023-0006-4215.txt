I am an artificial intelligence researcher and lecturer at Boston University. My software is on github, and has therefore been used to train Microsoft&#39;s Co-Pilot. If Microsoft imports and executes my code, they are bound by my license. I don&#39;t understand why what they do AFTER THEY IMPORT MY CODE affects whether they are bound by my license. They are using my code and violating my license.<br/><br/>Dr. Peter B. Golbus<br/>College of Arts and Sciences, Boston University
