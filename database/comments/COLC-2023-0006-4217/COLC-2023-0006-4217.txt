I believe it is important to protect the intellectual property of individual artists.  AI image generators use data that is scraped from any available sources, to be used in any way the prompter sees fit, without the consent of the originating artists.  Harm to the originating artists is not only possible, but happening currently.  AI-generated images will cause confusion among the viewing public.  Viewers not familiar with an artist&#39;s body of work will see AI-generated images in that artist&#39;s style, using that artist&#39;s visual elements, and believe that the originating artist created it when they did not.  An image prompter may monetize the AI-generated images that contain elements or stylistic similarities with an artist&#39;s work, undermining the artist&#39;s ability to earn a living from their original works.  A reasonable, responsible legal framework needs to be built in order to protect artists&#39; efforts and livelihoods, while still permitting AI tool users to enjoy the use of AI image generators.
