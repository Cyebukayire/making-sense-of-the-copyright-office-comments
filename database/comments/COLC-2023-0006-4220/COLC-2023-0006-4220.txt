If AI is sourcing its intelligence from previously created content, then I am worried about what this means for marginalized people and our artwork. I am Native American and my artwork, writing and philosophy has been ostracized from mainstream publication or co-opted by white authorship. AI would repurpose this system to work against me and my art. It&rsquo;s crucial that copyright laws acknowledge how at-risk AI puts people of color and our artistic contribution to the world.
