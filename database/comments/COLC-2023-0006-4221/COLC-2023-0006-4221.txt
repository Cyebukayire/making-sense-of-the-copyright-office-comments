I am STRONGLY against the application of copyright law to AI produced works.  I am a visual artist in the video game industry and on a vast scale, my work and the work of countless workers like me is continuously fed into generators and plagiarized.  Having rights to the product of our own labor is a human right.  Workers who produce the original pieces that are stolen for AI use, as well as the companies/studios which they are produced for, are solely entitled to the rights to that product.  Stealing that information, reproducing directly from it, and then making money from it is a violation of existing copyright law.
