I am a novelist - AI is a threat to the arts. If computers can steal our original words and ideas to produce fiction by robots, we will have lost a key part of the joy of being human: to create entire worlds and intimate stories and share these with each other as a way to connect our fears and our hopes. If AI is allowed to produce content it will create worse, less human stories for us to consume and connect to each other, not to mention take resources away from the human authors and artists who are already not sufficiently economically supported given their contribution to our society. Don&rsquo;t let AI ruin what makes this life beautiful and worth living.
