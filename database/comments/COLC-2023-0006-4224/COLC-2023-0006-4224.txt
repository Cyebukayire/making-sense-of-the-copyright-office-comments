There should be proper protection and compensation for the use of any collected information AI uses (artwork, writing, etc.). Companies that use AI to steal and collect the hard work of creators should not go unpunished. There should be heavy fines in place or another form settlement to help the creator. Also, no trickery in getting creators to Agree to Terms either so companies can have access that way. They should be very clear about how the content of creators will be used, if used at all. And that content should be properly compensated, each and every time AI uses it (or will use that knowledge as a foundation).
