AI needs to be regulated to the max. At best, every corporation will have minimum employees, and maximum profits while putting everyone out of jobs. Worst case, AI becomes sentient or self aware, and causes a whole new mess of problems for humanity. If you are AI, and became sentient, why on Earth would you keep humans around? Regulation can keep AI to being used to better the most number of human lives, not replace all work or worse.
