I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor of Arts, with a focus in game design and computer graphics. I have been in and out of various industries as a graphic designer and digital multimedia specialist. By far the best paying jobs I&#39;ve held are in these fields. Currently, I work as a part-time rotisserie cook and I am desperately trying to get back into the graphic design or game design industry full time. I am perpetually job searching for positions in these fields.<br/><br/>Since generative AI entered the public domain last year, I have seen the amount of available jobs in the graphic design and video games fields drop from numbers in the 10,000s to merely numbers in the 1,000s. This data is based on the search results for &quot;graphic designer&quot;, &quot;game artist&quot;, &quot;2d artist&quot; and related job positions when searching for open positions on LinkedIn and Indeed.<br/><br/>It is incredibly demotivating to see the job market decimated for these fields so quickly, and even more so because the AI software eliminating jobs in these fields is built on non-consensual, uncompensated work. I know this, because I have searched for works under my name using the tool &quot;haveibeentrained&quot;, and have found copyrighted works of mine in machine learning databases. Specifically, haveibeentrained is a search tool that enables anyone to search for works of theirs within the training corpus of Stable Diffusion.<br/><br/>I was never contacted by Stability AI, the makers of Stable Diffusion, to negotiate the terms, compensation, and scope of my work used. I would have never consented to the use of my work in any sort of AI, and I feel that I have been morally and financially wronged. It is so perverse that my own work will be used against me to diminish my economic opportunities.
