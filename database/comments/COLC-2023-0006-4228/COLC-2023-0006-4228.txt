I am a career artist, specializing in digital painting and content for games. AI text and image generation represents a profound danger to every creative job in the country, from individual contract artists to major movie studios. People are already losing their jobs in droves to AI, and being hired back for pennies on the dollar to correct the low quality products for market. Meanwhile, AI can only do what does by stealing the work of those same artists, putting it through a digital sausage grinder, and squeezing out a probabilistic average based on the users inputs. The rampant theft is dissuading artists from creating, and it is convincing a generation that they don&#39;t need to work to produce something of value.<br/><br/>Nothing that an AI produces can be said to belong to the person feeding it prompts. No part of an AI image is created by a human. Even painting over an AI image to correct its flaws leaves most of the work to be done by stolen effort. There can be no path forward with AI unless the following happens:<br/><br/>-The government must mandate that ALL AI databases be purged and re-populated exclusively with voluntarily donated and compensated work.<br/><br/>-contracts and terms of service agreements that automatically opt-in artists or contractually require opt-in to AI databases must be prohibited<br/><br/>-work that involves AI to any significant degree (anything beyond pre-production concept and storyboarding) must not be granted copywrite protections<br/><br/>-laws must be put in place to materially punish those who create AI databases with unauthorized content, for each individual count of IP theft<br/><br/>I say again, there are profound dangers inherent in allowing AI to proliferate unchecked, no matter how much money corporations believe they&#39;ll make by cutting artists out.
