AI technology is built upon a foundation of plagiarism and theft. AI programs are trained to do their tasks by using works (be they art pieces, written works, recordings) without the permission or consent of the original creators.<br/><br/>If a person creates a work of some type that so closely copies another&#39;s work, we generally require acknowledgement: this work is parody or this work is commentary or this work is done as an exploration of x-theme. Otherwise, if that is not done, that creator can face consequences for plagiarism or slander/libel.<br/><br/>We already have rules about related issues in the creative sphere. AI-generated projects should follow similar rules.<br/><br/>AI-created works should only be trained on works that the original creators of those works consent to their copyrighted material being used in such a way. Those original creators should be compensated, should they choose to have their works used in such a way. And, AI-created works should have to be disclosed as such in whatever for they&#39;re made.<br/><br/>AI-created things are not created by people the way actual works of art/fiction/etc are produced. They&#39;re created by computer programs that are remixing elements of pre-existing material (almost exclusively without permission or consent of the creators of the original items) to spit out &quot;new&quot; things that copy elements of that base material. People who use these programs plug in what amounts to search terms into their inputs, to direct the program some, but they&#39;re not creating anything more than an elaborate google search query.<br/><br/>These &quot;works&quot; should not be allowed to used without disclosure of their origin as AI-produced, given how they&#39;re formed.<br/><br/>This technology is new but its roots are in theft and plagiarism, two issues we already have methods for dealing with  and the direction AI things go on regards to regulation and copyright should be informed by those roots. Don&#39;t let these thieving weasels continue to build this technology on lies of legitimacy. Artists and creators need protections against this fakery.
