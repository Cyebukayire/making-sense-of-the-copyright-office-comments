Copyright work must be human made. AI lacks that human element completely. Typing a couple prompts into your computer is no where near enough to call it human made. If you went to restaurant and ordered some food are you the chef? Answer: No you are not. Just like if you typed a couple prompts into your computer you are not the author. You made an order and the AI filled that order. The AI is the author not you. Therefore not human made and not copyrightable. Much of what AI does has only been made possible by the mass theft and exploitation of human artists/authors. We need regulations that keep human creatives safe from this kind of exploitation. Thank you for your time.
