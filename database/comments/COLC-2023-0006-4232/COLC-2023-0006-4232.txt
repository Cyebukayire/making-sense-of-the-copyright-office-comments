I strongly oppose allowing works produced by AI to be copyrighted. AI in its current form can only regurgitate images or text that were created originally by humans, and often were fed into the training data for the AI without the consent of the original artists or writers.<br/><br/>Currently, part of my income is from creating original artwork as commissions for scientific papers, outreach materials for scientists and nonprofit agencies, and for other similar purposes. As it stands, a generative AI model could be trained using my artwork without my consent and then create images in exactly my artistic style automatically, but without the nuance or understanding from the perspective of a human biologist. If AI-generated images can be copyrighted, then so could those - even though I never was informed and never gave permission to use my artwork for those models. This reduces the value of my work as a creative individual, especially when AI trained on images without understanding how the overlap of bird feathers work or why certain features make sense in an environment would be able to produce images that look like they were made by me, but that contain scientifically implausible false details and information. <br/><br/>I am especially increasingly concerned with the use of AI to create and use people&#39;s likenesses and voice without their consent as well. To be able to re-create and then copyright a digital copy of a person becomes greatly damaging to our ability to tell truth from fiction in an increasingly polarized political and social climate.<br/><br/>For any and all AI/neural network datasets, works used within those datasets need to be opt-in by law. There are people who want their works to be used to train AI, and they should be allowed to do so - and then, with their consent, that data could be used in a number of ways. But making it opt-in is the key, since currently platforms are under no obligation to tell an artist, writer, or individual that their works can or have been used, which is a violation of intellectual property and privacy.<br/><br/>Additionally, AI works must be clearly marked or labeled in all cases so that nobody is under the false idea that those works were created with intent by a human. This goes for AI generated images meant to look like artwork as well as output intended to mimic photography or video. This label should be within the file metadata as well as easily visible by the casual viewer. AI projects should automatically output this kind of watermark on anything they produce in order to help keep people from taking false images as reality, or generated work as being created by an actual human.
