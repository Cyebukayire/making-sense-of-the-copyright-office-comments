I believe AI is a danger to the human kind. I know that sounds like a bit too much but we can&#39;t let AI replace writers and artists! If they get replaced, who&#39;s next? The hardworking citizens of these United States that&#39;s who! AI will replace all of us and you&#39;ll be damn sorry you didn&#39;t do anything sooner. Everyone has a right to happiness and AI will take that away, please don&#39;t let it happen.
