I am a digital artist whose work has been used as training data for Artificial Intelligence illustration programs like Midjourney and Dall-e. My work was taken without my permission, used in a way that I disagree with, and advertised as an alternative to paying me and other artists like me for our work. The application of this software is nothing short of unethical, and needs to be strictly regulated. Human influence or no, if a person takes my art and generates a machine that can replicate it without my consent, that is a violation of my license and my copyright.
