hello.<br/>i am a software developer and music creator and i&#39;ve given many of my works away for free but under a license that requires and copyright retainment (software) or free download (music), going back to 1992.<br/>the way that LLM input is taken from copyrighted sources that include mine, and is regurgitated by the LLM later, never retaining copyright statements, is stealing my copyrighted material.<br/>i believe that it should be considered copyright infringement to use copyrighted works as input to an LLM training without having either gotten a license to do so, or retain copyright in the output correctly. i do not want to stop LLM research and the usage of LLMs for solving problems, i&#39;m only interested in ensuring that my (and others) copyrighted works are not being infringed upon.<br/>thank you.
