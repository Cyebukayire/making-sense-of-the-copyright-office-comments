AI could not exist if not for the IP and copyrighted material of artists, musicians, voice actors, etc. Artists are not against the proliferation of AI, what we object to is having our work stolen to train programs for the financial benefit of a private company. Many times the theft is obvious; passages taken directly from the written source material, blurry signatures from artwork used to train the dataset, entire artistic styles one can acquire from the dataset simply by writing an artist&#39;s name. I myself had had my own artwork scraped to train these programs, all without my consent of financial compensation. These AI companies could not exist without the work they&#39;ve scraped, and yet they&#39;re the ones who stand to financially benefit. We ask the Copyright office to continue its policy of denying copyright protections to AI platforms, as there is no human creativity involved. Likewise, we request some kind of process to determine how much a human needs to be involved for copyright protection, as some companies will surely take advantage by applying for copyright for an AI-produced piece barely touched by a human, a human only incorporated to get copyright protection.
