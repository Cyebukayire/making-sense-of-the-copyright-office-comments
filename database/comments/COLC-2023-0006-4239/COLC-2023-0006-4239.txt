My name is Brian Steele. I am a film and television writer. And, as a writer, I am deeply concerned that AI has been scraping writing, artwork, photos, film and all manner of copyright protected work in order to build out their models and create supposedly &quot;original&quot; work. In fact, they are stealing other people&#39;s material, putting it through a blender, and then passing it off as their own. Stop the theft. Enforce copyrights.
