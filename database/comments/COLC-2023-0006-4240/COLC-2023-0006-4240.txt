This issue regarding generative &quot;AI&quot; is in service of large corporations and small amounts of people hoarding wealth and denying work and payment to those who actually contribute and do creative work in society. As an artist I am frustrated that my work and the works of every other human have been stolen in the service of making money for greedy people who want to get around paying creative people for the hard work it takes to create what they want. I have stopped posting any images of my work online as I refuse to have my work stolen, but that also means I cannot reach anybody to get new work. It is an impossible position we are being put in when we have no say in who gets to take our efforts and creativity and benefit from it, and then deny us the ability to see any benefit ourselves. This is a new and greater version of the systemic devaluation of creativity and humanity in our capitalistic society that we must aproach thoughtfully and not allow to continue on the current path. Please do not allow the greed of our society to strip us all of our rights to our own work and our creativity.
