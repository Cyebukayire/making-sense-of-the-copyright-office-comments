I am a writer and producer working in television and film. For the last four months, I have been on strike with my fellow members of the Writers&rsquo; Guild of America, partly to demand that our employers, the Hollywood Studios, institute some protections around the use of artificial intelligence in creating scripted entertainment. Thus far, the studios have failed to take our concerns seriously, which is why I&rsquo;m writing with this comment. I am extremely concerned about the way AI will affect my industry if it remains unchecked by government regulation. I&rsquo;m concerned for my job, and the jobs of every other writer, actor, director, cinematographer, production designer, costumer, VFX supervisor, and gaffer in Hollywood. And I&rsquo;m equally concerned about the way that our existing work may be used &mdash; no, stolen &mdash; to train the very algorithms that may one day replace us. This technology represents an existential threat to the creative professions, and I urge you to regulate it aggressively. Thank you for reading.
