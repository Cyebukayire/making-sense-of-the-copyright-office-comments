The use of AI, as it scans the internet for sources, inherently steals from artists and other hard working people and institutions. These people are not credited properly for the use of their work, like any other creator or researcher would have to do. AI needs to be regulated to prevent the theft of intellectual property, or it sets a precedent that will be abused by future programs, or entitled and lazy &quot;creators.&quot;
