As evidenced by the ongoing strikes by SAG-AFTRA and WGA, corporations are eager to use AI generated content to replace the work of human artists and artisans. Living, breathing creatives need better protections to ensure the viability of their work and livelihood. AI harvests the products of human creatives, most frequently without their consent or knowledge, in order to regurgitate its components in the facsimile of art. AI-generated content reuses components of artworks by human creatives and therefore should not be able to be protected by copyright laws. Human creatives need better protections to ensure that AI-generated content cannot harvest their hard work without their informed consent. Additionally, AI-generated content devalues the labor of human creatives while generating output that is devoid of meaning, creativity, and cultural worth, all things derived solely from human involvement. The copyright status of AI-generated content has serious implications for our culture across every medium, from the quality of the art we consume to the quality of life human creatives are able to enjoy. It is important to curb the wave of AI-generated content by refusing corporations the ability to replace human creatives with machine learning.
