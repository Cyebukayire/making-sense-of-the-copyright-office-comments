Artificial Intelligence as it stands now is not intelligent at all. It is machine learning that got turned into a plagiarism tool. It is violating copyrights across many mediums from visual art to voice acting to music production. Artists (and everyone) need to be protected from AI in order to fully exercise their rights to free speech and expression without fear of their work being ripped off or having someone use AI as a tool to create false evidence against them. AI is already flooding the market with computer generated books using actual authors&rsquo; names as well as &ldquo;informational&rdquo; books about mushroom foraging with incorrect information that could end up getting someone killed. We need regulations to stop these things from happening and keep people safe.
