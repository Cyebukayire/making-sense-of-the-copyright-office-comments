I&rsquo;m a digital painter. I went to college for it, I&rsquo;m paying the loans for it, and I was learning art long before I got into school for the skill I currently have. With AI all that work can be circumvented through theft. Because that&rsquo;s what AI is. It&rsquo;s not truly artificial intelligence. It&rsquo;s really only pattern recognition, and it uses actual artists for those patterns. It takes hundreds of works, STEALS hundreds of works, and the composites them into something that is worse: both technically and creatively. If the people who use AI want to make art? That&rsquo;s great! We could always use more artists in the world, but instead of stooping to thievery, they should pick up a pencil, and start the long journey I did when I was fourteen. Anyone can learn. It just takes time. That and a moral backbone.
