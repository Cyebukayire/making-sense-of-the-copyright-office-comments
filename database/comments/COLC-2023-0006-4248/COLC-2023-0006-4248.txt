It seems extremely clear to me that large language models such as OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT training on copyrighted material breaks both the spirit and the law of copyright. The data scraped for these large language models has been acquired unethically, and strong regulation in this sector is sorely needed. I urge the Copyright Office to take this extremely seriously, and I thank them for the opportunity to comment.
