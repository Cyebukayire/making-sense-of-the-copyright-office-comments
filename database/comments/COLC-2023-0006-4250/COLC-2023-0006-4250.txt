I don&rsquo;t have a large amount of legal knowledge, but as both a writer and an artist, I need it to be know that AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; and programs akin to Chat GPT are forms of blatant theft.<br/><br/>The data sets used to train these tools are built on stolen and copyrighted pieces, that- much more often than not- the original, human creators of which gave no sort of permission whatsoever for their work to be used, and have received zero compensation. The same goes for writing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; and &ldquo;writing&rdquo; should at the VERY least be completely void of any possibility to be copyrighted. I would hope that more people would push for the outright banning of such programs as Midjourney, Chat GPT, and the like, as they do much much more harm to creatives than whatever good they could ever do for whatever lazy, no life techbro decides they&rsquo;d rather steal the work of others than learn how to make art themselves. <br/><br/>Humans make art because we love to do it, because we feel called to do it. We make art because it&rsquo;s fun, and it helps us express ourselves. It&rsquo;s one of the things that makes us human.<br/><br/>AI programs don&rsquo;t make art. They churn out endless, mutilated mess for the sake of making money and they steal the love-filled honest work of artists and writers to do it.
