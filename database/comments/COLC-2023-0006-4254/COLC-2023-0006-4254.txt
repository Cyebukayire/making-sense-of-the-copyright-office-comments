Because Artificial intelligence only creates using works derived from other people, it can never produce anything wholly its own. The code and learning used to produce images is copyright-able but the images themselves cannot since they&#39;re just collages of previously made images (not to mention that the parts of the whole are derived from artwork used without artists&#39; consent and therefore constitutes as stolen intellectual property). Copyright is and only should be about protecting the property of human people. Which is more valid for copyright, the millions of works created by individual human people, or the rearranging of those same works by an algorithm?
