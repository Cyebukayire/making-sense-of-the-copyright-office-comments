Using AI and training it on copyrighted materials can only serve to dilute the larger creative and scientific body of work. Particularly in creative fields, using AI in this manner will disincentivize the creation of original and thought-provoking material, as well as be concretely set in our modern bias for what art is and the kind of art that is valued, limiting the ability for new ways of thinking to break through. New intellectual and creative movements can only prosper through the humanity of those with the ability to boost those voices, AI will only cannibalize the past to financially enrich those who do not need it.Freely allowing the use of AI in this manner will be a major detriment to any kind of future that seeks to improve upon our present.
