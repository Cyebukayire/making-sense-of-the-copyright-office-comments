Since the main source, what makes up mostly the entirety of databases this models are based off is from not consented use of profesional work from photographers, artists, etc., and the process in which this images are generated do not have any human source other than just a couple of vague words, this cannot be and should not be viable for the protection of copyright, highlighting it as a protection to the actual professionals and artists, to the ones whose work is being scrapped despite not agreeing to a mutual consent, thus being stolen and used with no fair use.<br/><br/>Since the bubble of artificial intelligence popped, which is just made up of generative systems based on statistics and not real judgment (thus not really being intelligent), there has being countless professionals who have found their work, the product of their own mastery and rights, stolen by big companies whose only ulterior motive is not only to flood the popular media with misinformation and lies, but also to have a chance to get rid of those who truly work for their own craft, and this ultimately (referring to artificial intelligence and generative models), in any common space with a minimal amount of judgement for what is really fair, should not only be withdrawn from the right to have copyright over it, moreover these type of models and databases should be inspected, forbidden from its use and ultimately shut down (and punish its respective scrapers, owners).<br/><br/>Professionals already have enough preoccupations for some third party users whose only reason to exist is to rob and take credit for what is not theirs.<br/><br/>In case it really reached someone out there, thanks for the attention and concern surrounding the topic. Also, excuse me if I did not make myself completely cohesive, English is not my first language.
