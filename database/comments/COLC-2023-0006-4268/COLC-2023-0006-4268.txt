AI generated images and writing is theft.<br/>It is taking peices of preexisting material already copyrighted by a variety of entities, smashing them together in a terrible collage, and then claiming that as original work. It is not original. It was stolen from multiple sources. All of whom are never going to see income from projects profiting off their hard work. Artists and writers are already highly undervalued and underpaid.  AI, that is machine learning, is not original work. It&#39;s a plagiarism machine.
