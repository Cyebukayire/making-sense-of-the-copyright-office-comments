Corporate greed has run amuck. I&rsquo;ve worked in the entertainment industry as a producer, development executive and writer for 15 years so I&rsquo;ve been on both sides. My last job was at a tech start up that built AI and machine learning tools for creators, so I&rsquo;ve been immersed in this world for 2 years and watched the exponential growth and investment, so there is no time to waste. I&rsquo;ve watched the &ldquo;tech&rdquo; companies and consolidation slowly suck the creativity and life out of the tv and film industry, at a real human cost where the actually storytellers can no longer sustain a long term career without having multiple side jobs. All while the CEOs of these companies take home outrageous sums and cry poor at the same time. AI is set to revolutionize the industry and iprotections must be put in place for the vulnerable workers who will be displaced and exploited by corporations. These companies will not hesitate to legally steal from artists in order to enrich themselves and their shareholders. As seen by the Union action from the Writers&rsquo; Guild and SAG, this is an existential threat that in the long run will weaken the US&rsquo;s most influential export &mdash; film and television, which has long dominated and spread American values and ideals across the world.
