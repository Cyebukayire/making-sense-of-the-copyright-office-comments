I believe that AI generated content is not inherently unethical, but I believe that there should be regulations in place to ensure that all people whos work is used in AI dataset training consented to the use of it. I think AI development on a commercial level/on a scale wider than personal use should have to have documentation that proves all artists whos work is in the training data consented to its use that they can provide upon request to ensure the usage is ethical. I do not think an AI should be credited for works done at least partially by a human- I believe that we need to center the works that people do in order to ensure that corporations cannot rely primarily on AI content while failing to provide for the people who contribute to their efforts.
