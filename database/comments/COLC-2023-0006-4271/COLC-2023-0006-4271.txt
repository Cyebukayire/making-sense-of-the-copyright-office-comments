I&#39;ll try to be quick. Artificial Intelligence is bad for art, for creativity, and for society. The overall adoption of the technology would be a disaster. Instead of creating anything new, it would just be a regurgitation of what has already been created. While the technology industry has coined the term &#39;generative AI&#39; what it is really is automated plagiarism. It&#39;s theft via computer. Without the permission of previous artists, writers, and creators, these automated plagiarism programs take what has been made, and spits out some imitation of it. With that being said, there is no rational way anything &#39;created&#39; through this process should be allowed to have a copyright attached. Additionally, these AI systems should be ruled to be in violation of copyright and either pay for the materials they use, or be shut down permanently.
