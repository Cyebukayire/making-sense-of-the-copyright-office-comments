The manner in which AI creates is in no way original. It can&#39;t create itself, so instead has to draw upon the works of others (very often without the consent of the original creator) to make something &#39;new.&#39; AI is outright theft from people who have spent years studying art, creative writing, music and so on. Because of this, any works created through an AI tool should not be seen as original or considered for copyright. This would also help professional creators within their respective industries hold their jobs and not risk being replaced by a cheaper, faster alternative that has no needs that must be met solely for the sake of profit.
