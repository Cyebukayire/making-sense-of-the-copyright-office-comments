I have watched the frightening acceptance of AI into many fields in the past several months and political action must be taken immediately.<br/><br/>Websites are altering their terms and conditions to allow scraping of work that was submitted without the technology being a part of their original user agreements to provide content to sites and companies that were not agreed upon. Many artists and writers have already seen their work stolen by bots and added to databases without their consent.<br/><br/>This is a dangerous technology because it is misnamed and therefore misunderstood. The technology does not think for itself. It models and projects bits of datasets that are fed to it. These datasets maybe damaging and false and racist (as we&#39;ve seen with photo apps like Faceapp, whitening characteristics of uploaded photos of people of color.<br/><br/>It is also a regurgitation of artists&#39; and writers&#39; original content. It has been found to lift entire sentences from books and work published online by amateurs and hobbyists too.<br/><br/>It also makes academic papers out of whole cloth, inventing sources and not really sourcing or fact checking anything. There have been lawyers who filed actual briefs and argued cases with fictional case law. <br/><br/>Apps like ChatGPT just throw random words and phrases it was fed into a stew of nonsense but it can make itself seem real. Students have also been caught in the net of false gotcha accusations if they tend to write in certain formats, especially ESL students. This can get hard-working students expelled for honest work because an AI scan &quot;thinks&quot; it identified cheating.<br/><br/>I am also concerned about the labor and environmental effects of this technology. It is already pushing copywriters, advertisers, and journalists out of their jobs, and opens companies up to plagiarism, libel, false advertising claims and other litigation.<br/><br/>And environmentally, the power it uses is threatening to bankrupt companies alreqdy. So who is actually subsidizing companies using this tool to save a few bucks by offshoring human labor and creativity into binary code?
