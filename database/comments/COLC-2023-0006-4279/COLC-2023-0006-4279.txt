AI can be used for some good, but when it&#39;s replacing creative jobs like artists and writers - it is inherently unethical. The way AI scours existing content (e.i. artwork and writing), and creates an amalgamation of bits and pieces of people&#39;s work is straight up theft. The autonomy of creators is being taken away because they have not consented to their work being used in this way. Also they are not being compensated in any way shape or form for the stolen work. The only way AI can coexist in the entertainment industry is if it&#39;s heavily regulated and limited and not an integral part of the production process.
