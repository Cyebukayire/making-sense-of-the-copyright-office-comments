Artistically AI uses the work of artists to modify existing work. This artwork is used without the consent of artists. Ethically to replace a paid artist and use a program to mimic their craft is an insult. We have already seen many creations that only slightly modify artwork and claim it as a new piece. <br/><br/>As artists we do not consent to have our pieces, designs, styles, and expression copied and claimed by tech.<br/>We deserve the right to claim these as our own and fight tech designed to mimic our industry. <br/><br/>Ai cannot and will not merge works to create an entirely new concept, it can not take ideas from life, it only works to skirt around copyright law in hopes of profit. Existing pieces are placed together, with nothing that already exists as a piece. <br/><br/>While artists learn from each other and create entirely new ideas, ai steals and collages. <br/><br/>We want quality and growth. Corporations want to lower costs at the cost of that quality. <br/><br/>
