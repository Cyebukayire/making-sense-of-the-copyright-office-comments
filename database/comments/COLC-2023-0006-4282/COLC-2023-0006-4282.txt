AI creators needs to be held accountable and need to be asking permission from artists and creators before using their works and creations to train their AI models. Even more so when they&rsquo;re a for-profit organization. They&rsquo;re making money off of other peoples work without their consent and/or compensation. <br/><br/>I am an artist and it&rsquo;s horrifying to see how nothing is being done about what&rsquo;s basically rampant theft. I have witnessed so many AI Users sell their creations and prompts for money. AI models charge monthly subscriptions for using other people&rsquo;s works to train their models. It&rsquo;s horrifying and something needs to be done. <br/><br/>AI can be a great tool; but this isn&rsquo;t it. There needs to be regulations and protocols in place. These AI models need to be regulated. They need to contact artists and offer compensation and a contract if they want to use their art to train their models. Or even have a policy allowing the use of art from creators that have been deceased for a certain amount of years (10? 20? 50?). Anything that isn&rsquo;t this Wild West criminal wasteland. <br/><br/>I hope you listen to creators regarding this and take it seriously.
