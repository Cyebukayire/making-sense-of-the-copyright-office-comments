AI are programs are not really creating art. They are taking artists&#39; work and putting them in a program. Nothing that would come out of AI would be new, but stolen work of everyone who has been a victim of theft. AI works by recognizing a pattern and that is it. They might look good but the more you realize how messed up and random those details on, the less impressive it seems. Also it can take out watermarks that were supposed to be so it won&#39;t get stolen. There has been studies of people trying different watermarks with no pattern and colors that affects the final results. AI doesn&#39;t have a person&#39;s experience to make stuff that is emotional, like grieving. It would take what other people&#39;s work but that&#39;s it. Artist are already struggling but this would take away more from us. Also there are people who are using works of people who passed away, and there has been a family who asked not put his work into AI. But people didn&#39;t listen and did anyway. We could never know what they might make later if they were still alive but other people are using his style for any prompt. People are not respecting the dea. So why should AI art have any rights on protection? When they are not respecting the people who are alive.
