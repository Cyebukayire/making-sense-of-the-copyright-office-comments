My personal outlook on AI in regards to art and writing is that in its current form it may largely be considered theft of copyrighted materials. Often times companies or individuals scrape online forums, sites, or resources for their information to be used for training datasets without permission from the individuals who&#39;s copyrighted materials they are taking. As a result, companies and individuals have begun to profit and actively undermine those from whom they have taken copyrighted materials from. Some companies and individuals have gone beyond to secure rights to all resources they use in their own training datasets, but these few are the exceptions rather than the norm. Under this current system, resembling an honor system, there are no legitimate checks to ensure that copyright has been breached, and as such theft has become rampant. In the future I would hope to see much stricter regulations placed on the production of AI generated materials to ensure that no such copyright violations have occured. As it stands, for individuals and companies alike who are having their copyrighted materials stolen without permission have virtually no recourse in the matter, as there are far too many violations to counter. Without regulations to counter this massive influx of theft occuring to train AI models, individuals, collectives, and companies all stand helpless in the face of the nearing demise of copyright security online.
