Copyright should only be granted to human-created work and AI should not be allowed to use copyrighted works for training without permission of the copyright holder.  I am an illustrator and I feel that AI will be used to replace human artists like me if AI generated work is allowed to claim copyright.  Additionally, training an AI on work it didn&#39;t have permission to use is just adding insult to injury.  Stealing real artists&#39; work and then turning around to take their jobs.  I don&#39;t think the copyright office should be complicit in that.  Thank you for your time.  <br/>
