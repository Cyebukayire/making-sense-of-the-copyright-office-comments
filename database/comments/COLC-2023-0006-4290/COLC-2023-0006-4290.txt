AI, even in it&#39;s infancy, is a very useful tool, however it seems that the most popular way to use that tool is to exploit and sometimes even replace artists, writers, and others in the creative fields, rather than to aid them. I believe that any regulations, which there do need to be regulations, need to keep that in mind the most. AI is simply an amoral tool being used by immoral people and companies to rob creatives of their jobs.<br/><br/>Another problem with AI is the process of it&#39;s creation, more specifically in the AI image generator programs, which require hundreds to even thousands of training images to produce anything passable. The majority of programmers achieve this by scalping images off of the internet without care of the original creators&#39; knowledge, or consent. I believe that this process right here, should simply be illegal. While human artwork can be derivative, AI image programs can never escape their derivative nature because they completely lack their own imagination, and can even be told to copy an artist&#39;s style, should a morally dubious user decide they want an artwork but do not wish to give that artist the money they need to survive. AI programmers must ask for permission, and should not get away with being able to give a shallow plea for forgiveness, when their programs can do that kind of damage, and they should certainly not be able to make a profit off of such a blatant attempt to avoid the work that human artists put into their craft.
