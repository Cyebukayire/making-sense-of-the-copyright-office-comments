If an AI was used to create a composite piece of two works of art, something half way between the two, and then the user of the AI sold that composite, it would be ruled copyright infringement in an instant. I don&#39;t think doing the same thing, just with more pieces of art used as training, should be any different. <br/><br/>Soulless AI being treated as something of equal or greater value than genuine human creativity and ingenuity is not only something that is harmful to the livelihood of millions in this country alone, but a disgrace against humanity as a whole.
