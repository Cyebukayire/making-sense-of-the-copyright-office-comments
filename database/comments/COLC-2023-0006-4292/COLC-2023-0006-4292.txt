Hello. I am very concerned about the growing popularity of &quot;A.I.&quot; programs, particularly when it comes to the arts. What concerns me the most is that it seems there is nothing being done by those in charge about what I, and many others, view to be blatant theft of intellectual property, as well as bodily autonomy. I, myself, am an artist, who makes part of my living off of commissions I get requested online. In order to maintain this part of my income I need to be able to post my art online, however I have become increasingly hesitant to, as there are practically no protections in place, preventing my artistic property from being stolen for &quot;A.I.&quot; programs. Furthermore, I have seen a growing trend of using machine learning (which is what these &quot;A.I.&quot; programs actually are) to mimic the voices of actors, celebrities, politicians, etc., which really appears to me as a destruction of bodily autonomy. With no protections or regulations surrounding machine learning programs, people&#39;s livelihoods are at risk, and people&#39;s autonomy and property are being taken advantage of and stolen.<br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my statement, I hope that regulations surrounding the use of &quot;A.I.&quot; will help protect the people who are being disadvantaged by its growing popularity.
