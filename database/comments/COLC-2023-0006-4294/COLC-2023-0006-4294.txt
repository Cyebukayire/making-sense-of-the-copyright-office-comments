I want AI to have regulations. As it is, they&#39;re feeding AI stolen art and writing and voices so that they can spit out something that sounds or looks acceptable. This was done without consent from authors, artists, and actors. There needs to be regulations that make that illegal or else all artists and authors will be put out of business and rendered worthless compared to some machine. Also it&#39;s just wrong to steal something that someone has put years/decades of effort into mastering the technique of. At this rate we&#39;re going to have AI doing all the fun recreational things humans want to do, and leave humans to do all the menial tasks like clean and work. It should be the other way around.
