Hello! I will admit i never done this before, but it is important. I am sure you will receive these sorts of words plenty of times over and over, but AI art does harm even the smallest artist out there so it has to be said as many times as needed. I have seen cases of people with no care in the world about those that try to make a living off their passion be belittled straight in their face by the use of AI, degrading their work and mocking them with comments of the AI doing better than the artist themselves could do or &quot;fixing&quot; the work. It&#39;s of course emotional, but the art is part of showing emotions and showing ones joy in life as well. This just shows that there are people using the tool against the artists in more than just financially, but their spirit as well. <br/>If we let AI run on stolen work of artists that didn&#39;t ask to be involved in the process of AI learning at all, then it just looses the point of doing the work yourself as well. For joy, the love and the freedom to express ones emotes and share it with others. No one would wish to share any art if it all just ends up being churned in to an AI piece.<br/><br/>I will admit that the idea of the AI has it&#39;s uses, but the way it was put together is just not moral or fair to the artists, it&#39;s better to scrap it all and start over from only royalty free formats. this goes for voice AI and chatGPT and the likes of them. it all just ruins the point of interaction with others.<br/>It&#39;s better to spend that energy elsewhere to make life easier for us in work that breaks people physically and mentally, instead of ruining the little joy we can bring to ourselves and others.<br/><br/>Also, the fake edits of actual people thrown through the AI filter are disturbing.<br/><br/>That is all, i hope the right choices will be taken.
