Currently, artistic work generated by Artificial Intelligence is akin to tossing a net into a water to catch fish that someone else owns.   AI engines operate by fishing through a huge database comprised of work by other people.  I wouldn&#39;t mind if, like a human, the computer would absorb all that data and then create something entirely new from it.  But that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening.  The computer is simply taking data it deems relevant (whether text, images or videos) and then grafts it all together and calls it original.  That is exactly what most art students are told NOT to do.  All artists can gain inspiration from past works.  But such inspiration is supposed to lead to the creation of wholly original works.  AI at this stage is taking the work of others and attempting to pass it off as its own.  Any student caught doing that would fail the class.
