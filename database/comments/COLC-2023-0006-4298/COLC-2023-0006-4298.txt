I am not in favor of AI being treated as an individual entity that deserves copyright privileges. As an artist, I feel that AI as it exists cannot possibly create any work that is not based on theft and derived from a real human&#39;s work. <br/>In whatever medium an AI is set to work in, it inherently must &quot;learn&quot; from preexisting works and steal the data derived from those works to produce AI works. <br/>AI cannot be considered an individual and must be controlled by another entity. Therefore it should be treated as a tool for plagiarism and not elligible for Copyright. <br/>To preserve the rights and labors of human beings, AI cannot be treated with the same parity of a real person or company, it is a tool.
