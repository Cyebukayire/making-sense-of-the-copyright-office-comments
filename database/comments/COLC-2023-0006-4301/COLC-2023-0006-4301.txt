AI Generated content should not be allowed copyright. Art can only be created by a human, from experience, training, and native human creativity. The copyright office has long held this view, and it should not be changed. Allowing AI generated content to have copyright protection not only devalues human creators, but muddies the water as to what constitutes art overall.
