I am a working artist and designer and I strongly believe that the datasets used to train AI should NEVER contain copyrighted material that has not been sold to the company or person managing/developing/using the AI by the original creator of the copyrighted material for the express purpose of being used in an AI training dataset. AI training datasets also need to be made completely public and transparent. Artists, photographers, designers, authors, and any individual should be able to quickly and easily identify if their work or images were used in a dataset, and to have their work or images removed completely from the AI training dataset and AI program on demand with no delay. AI programs as they exist today are founded on flagrant copyright violations and theft and should not continue to operate without significant legislation to protect the artists and authors from whom these programs steal and exploit.
