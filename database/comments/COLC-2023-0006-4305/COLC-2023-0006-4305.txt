The creation of any object, image, song, poem, article, book, or any other human created thing is in and of itself a &ldquo;useful art.&rdquo;  This creation depends on drawing inspiration from the creation of others, combined with the art of the creator. AI is a twisted corruption of this process. instead of an artist&rsquo;s choice to select what will inform an artistic process, AI consumes everything that its algorithm considers, relevant and amalgamate all possible concepts into one hole. It&rsquo;s substitute the artists taste, and discernment for watt should be the foundation of the work, or what flavor or style can be applied to a work, with a computer&rsquo;s Brute force to cram every possible related application into product.  It debases creation into consumption and regurgitation. Part of art appreciation is the discovery of something novel, whether it be a novel combination of the familiar or an introduction of the new. AI can do none of this.
