Thank you for allowing public input on the matter of AI usage and regulations surrounding its use. I am heavily involved in the online arts scene, and both produce and view creative material of all types of mediums. Unfortunately, unethical training AI to produce images, voices replication, and photos that are getting realistic enough to have a hard time determining legitimacy have been a shockwave of a negative impact for the arts, both hobby and commercial. AI training without consent, compensation, and without control is a violation of the rights copyright owners have regarding ownership, usage, and copyright law. That does not even begin to approach the issue of AIs trained on and generating misinformation and bigoted content, perpetuating them.<br/>The Copyright Office should adopt the position that, like any other unauthorized usage, someone&#39;s copyrighted works being used to train AI goes against the Copyright Act. It should also be that participation in AI training should be strictly opt-in with clear-cut informed consent to avoid any potential violations, optimally at the same level of visibility privacy options like accepting cookies on websites are at.<br/>Thank you for your time, and again for letting the public give their input on this evolving technology. It&#39;s better to establish rules sooner better than later when it comes to matters such as this.
