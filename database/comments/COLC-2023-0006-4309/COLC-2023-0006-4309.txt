AI should have no access whatsoever to copyrighted works. It is theft to utilize copyrighted works in the training of generative AI, and results in copyright owners loosing profits, while users of AI unfairly take credit for work that is not theirs. AI works should not be considered original in any sense, because all AI does is regurgitate original work. There is no humanity nor any creativity involved in the things AI produces, only in the things AI steals from. <br/>As a creative person, the idea that AI could potentially have access to and use my own copyrighted works is deeply troubling. The idea that it could do so without my knowledge or my consent is a violation of my personal rights. The whole point of copyright is to protect original works and ideas. AI having access to such works completely negates the power of copyright, and puts all creatives at risk. <br/>It is my belief, that without explicit written consent from the author, AI programming should have no access to and no right to use copyrighted works. Additionally, I do not believe that AI work should be protected under copyright, as all AI-created work is a regurgitation of something else. One may argue that all artwork is derivative, but AI does not derive new art from the things it processes. It simply mashes it together with other items and then spits it back out.
