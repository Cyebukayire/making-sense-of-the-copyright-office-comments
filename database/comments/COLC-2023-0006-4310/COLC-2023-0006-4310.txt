The use of AI in any commercial situation--any use that a user makes any amount of money from the AI&#39;s work--is currently in violation of the spirit of copyright law. Any profitable use of AI must be required by law to disclose the sources from which the AI model &quot;learned&quot; how to create whatever it does (language, music, art, code, etc). Additionally, users of the AI must formally request PERMISSION from the creators of any protected by copyright work as part of &quot;teaching&quot; the AI. These creators must have explicit and unquestioned rights to a) blanket refusal to offer their work to the AI and b) discussion of monetary compensation, including a flat rate and/or a percentage profit from the AI user from any money made by the AI&#39;s creation, due to the creator&#39;s contribution to the AI&#39;s learning model. Violations of these rights must be persecuted in a court of law, and any current violations must be ordered to cease and desist as soon as possible.
