The use of AI can do nothing but weaken the entire basis of copyright protections. We have already seen that AI is dependent on stealing IP from individual creators in order to produce derivative content. Legal precedent has long held that only humans can hold copyright for products of their own design. The humans utilizing AI technology do not produce anything original and cannot in any meaningful way be credited with the products of these algorithms that would be rendered useless if not for large amounts of stolen IP being used to generate them. This would be an extremely harmful precedent to set that would deter innovation by disincentivizing individuals with actual creative capacity from producing work that they know would be legally stolen and made worthless to them.
