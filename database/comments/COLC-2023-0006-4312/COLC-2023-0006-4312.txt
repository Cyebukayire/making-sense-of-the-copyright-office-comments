I&#39;m a published poet and playwright and produced screenwriter and playwright. I have material registered with the Library of Congress. I am absolutely against A.I. being trained with existing copywritten material. If content creators want to opt into this, they should do so directly. I am also against material from A.I. being granted copyright protection. As it is the product of actual human labor, it should be redefined to qualify for trademark protection or a new category like unto it. <br/><br/>Thank you.
