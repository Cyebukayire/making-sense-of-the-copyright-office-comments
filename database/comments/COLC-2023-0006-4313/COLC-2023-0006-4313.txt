AI models should not be using copyrighted materials in their training data.<br/>Indeed, the AI will then generate information based on 3rd party copyrighted knowledge, and distribute this information without citing their sources, which is plagiarism.<br/><br/>When subject matter experts and content creators share their expertise publicly on the internet (e.g. in a blog), this is done with the intent of getting some benefit in return, such as traffic to their website, and authors are not allowing unauthorized distribution of their content (ref. Copyright notice on their website).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when an AI trains itself with this author&#39;s content, it makes their experise avaialble in another form, without the benefit of sending traffic to the author&#39;s website.
