The companies that developed AI acted as if copyright was irrelevant when sourcing images for their training datasets and in light of that I don&#39;t see how the images produced by these actions could be copyrighted. A new technology was developed that would not have been possible without the hard work of thousands of artists and terabytes of their work and yet they were uncompensated and uncredited. If a company has documentation to prove a clean dataset then in that scenario only does it make sense for the work to be copyrightable (since presumably all artists whose work went toward training the machine have agreed for their work to be used in this way and have been compensated and credited for their contribution). The only exception I could see is ownership of a specific arrangement of art (i.e. they can&#39;t copyright a character designed by an AI or any individual image the AI produces but they may be able to copyright a specific order of comic panels arranged by a human). If AI companies claim human artists are not needed then let them work with art produced by AIs-only for all their training. If human artists are needed for data trainingsets then those artists deserve the credit over the machine.
