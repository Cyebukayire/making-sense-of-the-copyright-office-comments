As a writer, both for pleasure and profit, I am deeply concerned with the current unregulated use of AI. I am aware that Archive of Our Own has been scraped by AI, which also contained some of my personal writings, along with hundreds of thousands of others. The fact that my work is being used to feed AI and then turn around and be used by grifters to make a quick buck on Amazon as sloppily made &ldquo;novels&rdquo; is horrendous. The fact that Hollywood now wants to use that same AI to create scripts and then pay their writers poverty wages to basically rewrite them, all under new names so they&rsquo;re not writers anymore, is fucking atrocious. And that our government is so old, so behind on technology, to let this happen without putting any kind of measures in place to protect our artists and writers and crafters is just beyond me. You will only be happy when every artist and writer is starving, and only the richest 1% of AI owners hoard all the wealth. Television and books and movies and every other art form will no longer hold the human depth they once did. Everything will be vapid and sound the same. Is this really what you want? It isn&rsquo;t what I want. And I sure won&rsquo;t be paying money for any of it. Do something useful for once. AI should not be copyrightable and it should not be allowed to use copyrighted works to feed itself.
