The blatant theft of copyrighted art, writing, and other media should be cause for elimination of all AI that has been trained on these products and AI that can&#39;t prove they weren&#39;t trained on these products. In addition AI developed media should not be subjected to copyright whatsoever. If a developer wishes to copyright their AI code that is acceptable. but to think that the developer of the AI has ownership over a product they technically did not create is ridiculous.
