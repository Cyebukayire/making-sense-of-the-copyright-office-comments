AI &quot;art&quot; is a sick joke honestly. Automation should be for dangerous or otherwise mundane tasks so that actual humans can create art, not the other way around. Machines do not actually create, they only steal what others have already created and regurgitate bits and pieces of those people&#39;s souls. Machines CANNOT create, they can only COMPUTE, and the fact that AI can&#39;t even do math correctly anymore should tell you all you need to know about how useful it is. Let people create art. Automate the things that are harmful to human life, not the thing that makes us human. That this is even up for discussion is pathetic. I have to convince this PAGE that I am not a robot in order to have an opinion, so why should &quot;art&quot; created by a robot be even remotely on par with what is created by a human??
