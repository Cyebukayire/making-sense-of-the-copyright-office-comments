Hello. Thank you for taking public feedback on this important matter. I am an artist who regularly puts my work onto my websites, and the current state of AI usage has me concerned. AI can be a powerful tool and I think has the potential for many great things, but without proper regulation only serves to harm individual artists, writers, creators of all sorts. My biggest concerns with AI models as they are used now are the loss of jobs/revenue for workers who are threatened to be replaced, and the ethics of the data collection for the database the models themselves use. Relevant to me, current AI models used for art use a database scraped off of the wider web without any consent or approval from the creators of the content it scrapes, and leaves no credit or compensation for the creators whose work it uses. This poses a danger to artists, both freelance and contract who may be looking for work, if companies begin using AI art using models that use the artist&#39;s work without them ever seeing a dime. It is unethical. I think these models to be made ethical should be run on databases that are collected only with permission, and if used commercially with fair compensation, possibly royalty-based, for those who contribute to the database. Furthermore, AI creations should not be copyrightable, as a court ruled earlier this month, since copyright should only be applicable to human creation. This would help disincentivize the replacement of creatives in media production. All of this should also be considered and applied to all AI models, where it may pose a threat of replacing human jobs. Thank you for your time..
