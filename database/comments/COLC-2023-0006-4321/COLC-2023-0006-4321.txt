I feel that current copyright office judgements are the correct path forward, specifically: <br/>No work that is entirely AI generated, involving no human, should be copyrightable. Only those portions which were entirely (majority) written by a living human can qualify for copyright protection. Example, if an artist is using Adobe Photoshop or other software that includes AI-generated capabilities to fill in space, or add components to the artwork, that is fine, because the base or majority of the artwork is being done by a human and they need some AI help for something mundane, however the software should keep track of that content that is AI created in the source files, behind the scenes so that the copyright office could challenge the artwork claim if needed, and so that the artist could prove that the majority of the work was indeed theirs.<br/>Further, any work that is derived from AI generated content is also not copyrightable, even if it was created by human - fruit derived from a poison seed is then poisonous in my opinion. I&#39;ve seen too many AI written news articles by media companies and these, in their entirety should not be copyrightable, even if the media company claims it - if it isn&#39;t human written, no reward should be given. Further, I would like to have the government REQUIRE the true author be stated explicitly by media companies - so that if they are &quot;publishing&quot; AI written/derived content, they must state it clearly at the beginning of the material, and not be buried after the content. I believe this would help build trust with the content and help defeat fake-news content.<br/><br/>In regards to the training of AI materials with copyrighted material, I feel it is entirely immortal and should be illegal for AI models to be trained on content that was not explicitly given to them.  However, since anything on the internet is effectively in the public domain, if a content owner doesn&#39;t specifically state on the website or page that no permission is given then the content, provided there is no copyright notice on the page, should be considered in the public domain and freely usable - however the AI generated content using that material must explicitly identify the used content either with its derived work, or as an attachment to it, like a table of content of materials used.<br/><br/>Lastly, I find it entirely questionable that technology companies think they are entitled to scrape the entirety of the web, without permission of content owners, simply because it&#39;s out there.  It&#39;s one thing to scrape the web like a search engine to provide the user with access to content they would not otherwise find - but GENERATING new content by scraping should be illegal to me - if no consent was given by the content owner.
