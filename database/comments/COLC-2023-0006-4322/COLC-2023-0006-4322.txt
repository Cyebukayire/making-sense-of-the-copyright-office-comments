All art (visual, audio, literary) created by AI programs is built on the theft of other artists, including copyrighted work. The only exception to this is if the AI program is fed only original content by its creator and the art of no-one else. Often times, the content that an AI is trained with, however, is used without permission and then replicated without permission. AI art is also not derivative and cannot be derivative because the program creating the art is just that--a program. It is a string of code that cannot take content and transform it into a new creation for the purpose of commentary or education. It is parasitic, taking shortcuts by letting others put in the work developing their skills, developing a unique style, and the years it takes to get to their skill levels and then reaping the rewards by mashing together aspects of whatever it has consumed without any thought, reason, or deliberation. <br/><br/>AI creations (art, literature, music) can never be original creations. They cannot be derivative, satirical creations. They are theft.
