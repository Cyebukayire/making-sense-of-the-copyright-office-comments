I am not an artist nor a content creator but I can see that artificial intelligence is an issue an a thorn in their side. There is a disregard for following copyright of artists and writers and trying to an ai on their &quot;style&quot; and then want to capitalize on something that wasn&#39;t there&#39;s to begin with. I also think that as a tool there&#39;s limited use and functionality before it becomes a plagiarism machine.
