AI being on the rise is somewhat concerning. Sure, said AI can be used for training purposes, however when it comes to another person&#39;s work and put it said AI, it comes off as theft. Simply, without their consent being used in AI. This also implies with AI being in the mainstream work ethnique, and if it does then said workers wont get paid or their work wont get known for or get it used for AI. With this, I feel the need that AIs using others work without their consent is a red flag. It only implies for those willing to make a profit, used said work without consent or saying the AI is their own work.
