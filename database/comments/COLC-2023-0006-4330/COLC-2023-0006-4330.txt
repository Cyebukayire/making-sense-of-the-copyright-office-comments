I think artificial intelligence ought to do our busy work&mdash;it ought to scan and select donuts and load the correct order into a box for the customer. It ought to count cows as they&rsquo;re being herded. It ought to be able to adjust traffic light durations. It ought to retrieve shopping carts in a parking lot. These are all things that a human does not need to do to be a human, to be fulfilled, to be happy. But art. Music. Stories. These things are what makes a person feel alive. Artificial intelligence ought not to be used in the arts. I strongly believe laws should be passed to prevent corporations and other such business entities from using artificial intelligence to perform the work of the artist, the musician, and the writer. The arts should remain in human hands and corporations ought never to control them with machines. Thank you.
