It&#39;s so important to put protections in place for the artists and everyday people AI is taking advantage of. Without strict regulation, we leave the door open for scammers to fake the identity of anyone with AI voice bots and deep fakes. As it is, voice actors cannot request AI Voice Clones of their own voices be taken down because they do not own the rights to their own voices. They have to reach out to whoever owns the copyright of the original material that was stolen to have THEM ask to have the synthetic AI voice removed. This is ludicrous that we can&#39;t even own our own faces, voices, or art anymore. <br/><br/>In addition to the identities of celebrities and artists big and small being protect, and their innate right to consent on the duplication of their identity (not imitation, but *duplication*), we also have to consider the visual artists and writers, whose work was stolen off the internet with no consent, no ability to opt out, and no recourse to stop the damage that occurred as a result of this blatant theft. <br/><br/>The decisions made thus far to not allow copyrights to materials not made by human hand is the right way to go. We should go even further to include deep fakes and AI Voice clones as well. We also need recourse for people who own their artistic style, their voice, and their likeness to be able to legally stop people from using those core pieces of their identities without consent.<br/><br/>Without a human author, there is no way to prove ownership. &quot;AI&quot; is simply plagiarism software, that consumes actual art made by humans, and regurgitates it into a form similar to whatever prompt is asked of it. Do not negate the years of training and hard work all these different Visual Artists, Writers, Singers, and Actors have gone through by allowing plagiarism software to steal it and profit from it.
