&quot;Work&quot; made using AI systems that are trained on other peoples copyrighted works should not be able to hold a copyright themselves. this is because the work was only made possible by the computer smashing together things made by other people that have been scraped without their knowledge or consent. it is not and never has been &quot;intelligent&quot;, and thus cannot create anything new on its own or from its own imagination. People may argue that typing &quot;prompts&quot; is sufficient enough to say that they have created a work using these generative systems, but the AI would not be able to work at all if it had not been first trained on other peoples copyrighted works. I think that not only should works generated by these AI systems not be able to be copyrighted, I think that the systems should be forced to wipe all training data of works that were gathered without consent of the owner that is not in the public domain. They may also argue that it is similar to an artist creating a collage, in which an artist takes images from various places and arranges them to make a new work, and that typing in prompts is a similar process, but it does not account for the fact that, even with &quot;original&quot; directional prompts, the computer is still not making a new work, the AI system is actively trying to copy and mimic existing works from its training data because that is what it was designed to do. existing works that are almost all under copyright by their respective creators.
