I am in favor of ethical AI where artists and writers are properly compensated for the work they did to train the AI. It is important that the creators&#39;s art is only used with the creator&#39;s explicit consent. <br/><br/>Every AI tool that is using stolen content from creators needs to be wiped and taken down and they must pay the creators properly for the use of their content retroactively to pay for damages and loss of business incurred for the duration of the AI&#39;s life. <br/><br/>It is wrong to steal from hardworking creators and profit off of the stolen art work.
