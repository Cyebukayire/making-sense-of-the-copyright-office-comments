I strongly believe that AI-generated material should not be eligible for copyright protections. The issues regarding the legal or copyright status of the data/material that AI is trained on, and what it may reproduce or copy in whole or in part, and whether the creators of that material consented to its use in training an AI, should disqualify AI-generated material from itself being copyrighted.
