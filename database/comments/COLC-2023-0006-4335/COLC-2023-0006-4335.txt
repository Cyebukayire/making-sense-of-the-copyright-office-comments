It is ridiculous that AI companies been allowed to run rampant without any type of legislation keeping them in check. AI companies have stolen and profited from many people whose work is copyrighted, and have negatively impacted workers across many industries globally. On top of that, some programs have already shown to have negative impacts beyond displacing jobs. One lawyer in the U.S used Chat GPT for a real case of theirs: the problem is that Chat GPT is not an internet search engine, and made up a fictional case, which the lawyer proceeded to utilize in their case. People&#39;s voices have been used for entertainment, but it is entirely possible that people may use such technology for nefarious purposes and further spread misinformation on a variety of topics. These are only a few examples of what has or can occur. It is imperative to take action as soon as possible.
