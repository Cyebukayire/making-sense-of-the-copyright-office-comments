While I believe that generative AI has a possibility of enabling advancement in certain fields to progress and evolve, the current incarnation is a cesspool of copyright infringement and trademark violations. Allowing companies to scrape the entirety of the internet without seeking any type of permission from site owners or allowing people to upload content without legal ownership is against the very nature of the current legislation in place for intellectual property. People own content that is being stolen and fed into a machine without any plan to compensate them for their labor. Due to this unfair exchange, the generative AIs are in turn being fed nonsense. At the rate we are going, copyright infringement will continue to happen while the machines are in turn made ineffective and &quot;dumber&quot;. I firmly believe that some type of legislation needs to be put in place to ensure that people&#39;s intellectual properties are not stolen by companies cutting corners in the name of progress. Advancement can happen without breaking the law and steal other people&#39;s work to prop up their own. Please consider enforcing copyright law on the companies that are flagrantly violating said laws.
