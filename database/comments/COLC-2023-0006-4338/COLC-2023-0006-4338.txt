We are in dire need of regulation, the damage to society this technology will bring can already be felt through identity theft, scams, pornography made of non consenting people be it adult or children in a scale never before seen, loss of employment and reduction of opportunities for all. The &quot;jobs&quot; promised by these tech companies either don&#39;t last or won&#39;t come simply because that&#39;s the point, not paying.<br/><br/>The datasets used to create their AI&#39;s are built on theft and exploitation, it&#39;s not like data brokers don&#39;t exist, they knew it and instead the people behind it chose theft because that&#39;s the mindset. When ethicists warned companies like Microsoft and Google about the implications if not illegal stuff going in with how their own AI&#39;s were being built the first thing these companies did was fire them, and we know how that works in the end, no wonder we have a bunch of people turn into dust at the bottom of the ocean.<br/><br/>If AI receives copyrights then we are done for as a society, prepare for the most massive wave of layoffs since the great depression with no way of getting out of the hole. I don&#39;t know what to tell you, today is artists, writers, tomorrow is teachers, office workers and so on in a constant degradation of our way of life.<br/><br/>God bless.
