I don&rsquo;t think works made entirely by Artificial Intelligence should be copyrightable. In addition, I believe it&rsquo;s a breach of the spirit of copyright law to train an AI on copyrighted works (when permission to use it has not been given).<br/><br/>For that matter, it shouldn&rsquo;t be called &ldquo;Artificial Intelligence&rdquo; because that connotes more power and creativity than the technology actually has. It should be called something like &ldquo;Randomly Seeded Interpolation&rdquo; or something. But this last comment is only tangentially related to copyright law.
