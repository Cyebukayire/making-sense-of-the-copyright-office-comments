My comment is short and simple. With an economy that&rsquo;s growing but with stagnant wages and rising costs, to take what could potentially take jobs from creative people and money from artists and give it to companies worth millions seems&hellip;detrimental. <br/><br/>There is unlimited value in the human mind. AI should be used in fields that do not infringe on creative spaces. Use it in healthcare, school, the government. <br/><br/>But for the arts? No. Unless you want to see humanity devolve.
