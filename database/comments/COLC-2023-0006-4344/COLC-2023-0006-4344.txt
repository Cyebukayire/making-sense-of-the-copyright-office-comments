Artificial Intelligence being copyrighted should not be allowed as a) the final product itself is not created by a human but a set of prompts that a computer amalgamates together, and b) there is no way to tell if the art/voice/instrument samples aren&#39;t stolen and ripped from an artist that did not give permission to be used in the samples the computer is using.
