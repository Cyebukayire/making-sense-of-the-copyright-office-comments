AI has no place in art in the way it is currently being used - artist&#39;s intellectual property is being ceaselessly used without their consent, to train these models<br/>Each and every artist behind pieces of art used to train an AI model should be compensated at a rate of their choosing, and be asked for permission before their work is used.<br/><br/>This mainly applies to paintings/digital drawing/other similar art, but the same can absolutely be said about music, voice acting, and more<br/><br/>The arts need protecting. It is our duty to protect them. Please do so.
