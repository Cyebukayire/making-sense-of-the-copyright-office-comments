AI isn&#39;t even really AI, it&#39;s machine learning. It&#39;s taking input and occasionally outputting sensible stuff. The inputs that are usually taken are without permission of the original creators. So it&#39;s copying others work with some modifications...Thats plagiarism. No one should be allowed to copyright &quot;ai art&quot; and they should be held responsible to the copyright of the works they rip off. All ai works do are worsen blind consumerism and screws over artists and other workers the value derived from their labor. Additionally, many large studios may try to use this as a union busting tactic, which should not be allowed especially when it will be work derived from the union writer&#39;s previous work.
