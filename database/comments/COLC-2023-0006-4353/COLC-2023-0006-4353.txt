Hello -- I&#39;m a San Francisco-based filmmaker and journalist by way of Mississippi. I&#39;ve been at this for decades, so it is very much a personal matter. What troubles me more is the arrogant, cavalier &quot;move fast things and break things&quot; mantra attitude as to its influence on broad society, which has characterized much of my adult life. I view the arrogance of those who create works of art via degenerative AI too and be completely oblivious to the ethical effects as akin to views in this clip from Jurassic Park: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PLvdmifDSk. I think going forward we should not make the same mistake as our incredible willingness to privatize the Internet in ~1994, and abdicating our gains in the early autonomous space (which is now causing chaos and giving San Francisco the runaround!). It will be interesting to see how this develops, though -- and lest I mention the strikes in Hollywood, on account of studio bosses having become untethered from reality. It&#39;s essential for the worker and for the health of broader society that this corporate kleptocracy is checked in the form of deeper scrutiny from federal agencies, including the Library of Congress itself. Perhaps we can take some inspiration from Germany, where Netflix pays its content creators residuals already. The United States must continue to lead on this issue and not delegate its responsibility to the private sector once again. Thanks!
