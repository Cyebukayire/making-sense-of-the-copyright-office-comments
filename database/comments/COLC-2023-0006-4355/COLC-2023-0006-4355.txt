AI generated content has been created by scraping various other art, writing, music, etc. often without permission of the creator. As there is no way to ensure that every work used to train an AI has been approved by its original creator, I am vehemently opposed to offering any sort of copyright to the AI creations. These are not original but compilations of many other, often stolen, things. Additionally, this is already hurting the worker and the economy as big businesses try to use AI generation to avoid paying employees or contractors. If this continues unregulated, or allows these AI items to be copyrighted, the impact on employment will be devastating. Many will lose their jobs to what is effectively a robot that can churn something out for free or a fee. Big businesses like Disney are already cutting out actors by pasting their likenesses into films and using AI generated art to avoid paying artists. This will continue and branch into many, many fields besides &ldquo;the arts&rdquo; without regulation. Many jobs will become automated and it will become standard practice for businesses to slash human staff whenever possible in favor of a cheap AI replacement. I beg of you, do not let this be our future.
