I beg of you, please PLEASE limit the way AI is used to replace human artists, both visual and literary. Creativity is not the purview of a machine. It is not pushing buttons and getting art, based on an algorithm. IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO SCRAPE ME AND MINE WITHOUT PERMISSION OR COMPENSATION. The only people making money off of this is the thieves who built the plagiarism programs spitting out product by the millions.
