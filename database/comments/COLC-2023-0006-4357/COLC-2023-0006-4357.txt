On the topic of AI, there are many ways to look at the situation. While it may be used for good and for conceptual ideas in creative works, AI should not be used for advertising, selling, and or used as a replacement for real and true art made by humans. The main issue with the use of AI is through the training of said AI, which is taken through the works of other people for the AI to study and automate through what they&rsquo;re given. People who use AI can also use any voice clip they may find online and use it to their advantage, which violates the victim&rsquo;s rights and may count as identity theft. These are the reasons why AI is unconstitutional and violates copyright.
