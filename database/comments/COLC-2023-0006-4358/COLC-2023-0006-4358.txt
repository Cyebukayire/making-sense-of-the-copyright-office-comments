AI&rsquo;s are hard to train on only ethically sourced materials, images that people give explicit permission to train AI on. Silence is not a yes. Also- do the artists get any compensation? I feel like anything created by AI is unfair to human artists putting in time, personal experience, formal training, and nuance around current trends and styles. Companies shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to profit off something they didn&rsquo;t have real people put effort into.
