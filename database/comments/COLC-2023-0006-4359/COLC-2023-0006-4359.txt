I write content for tabletop roleplaying games. While not strictly necessary, art is pretty useful in the field. While the idea of using generated AI images in my work has a lot of allure, I cannot in good conscience partake of it while the art used to train these AIs is used without the permission of the creators. Additionally, while we still have this capitalistic hellscape, there is the very real prospect of people losing out on work as a result. <br/><br/>On a baser level, I want AI and automation to make life easier for everyone; but until we make it okay in our society for someone to &quot;not work&quot; and to still be able to survive and have their basic needs met, we cannot just let AI and automation push marginalized people out of their jobs. Especially gig based jobs like providing artwork for projects. So, pragmatism demands that we not let large corporations funding these AI programs to push rates lower, an AI artist forces a race to the bottom in the worst way possible.<br/><br/>Ethically, steps need to be taken to make sure that future AI developers pay people for their work. Artists should be able to OPT IN rather than being required to OPT OUT. This goes for AI generated artwork, AI generated text, AI generated music, and AI generated anything else I can&#39;t think of at this time, and AI generated anything that may not even exist yet. And as such, steps need to be taken to ensure that current AI developers make reparations for work that they have already stolen.<br/><br/>AI could be a useful tool to help artists and writers and other creatives improve their workflow, but it would be terrible if it removed those creatives from the process entirely, allowing greedy corporations to beautify their products at the expense of the gig workers that used to make the art that adorned said products.
