I fully agree we need to regulate A.I. I have never liked it. I am a writer. I do not want a robot to do what a human can only do. We are the artists and we don&#39;t want anything hollow used just to generate income. A.I can not replace humans. Use them in fields it is necessary but don&#39;t allow them to take over careers. Humans deserve better.
