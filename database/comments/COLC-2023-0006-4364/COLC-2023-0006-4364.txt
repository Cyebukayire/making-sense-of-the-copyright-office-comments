As an artist, I&#39;m afraid of how copyright laws currently don&#39;t protect the artists, writers, and musicians so many AI programs are directly stealing from. It&#39;s users are claiming artistic expression when it&#39;s more accurately plagiarism, a fancy Photoshop, and things like chatgpt are  full of misinformation and literal lies. I see large media corporations planning to use AI art to get out of paying their actual workers liveable wages. The WGA and SAG strike lasting as long as it has is a direct outcome of these beliefs. Corporate greed is a big motivator for the laws to not change and actually protect the people heavily affected by this advancement in technology.<br/>I can see how AI can be a useful tool, like the website Goblin Tools: it automatically breaks down tasks into smaller accessable  tasks, but it doesn&#39;t steal from actual human beings to do so.<br/>Outside of the theft, I believe that AI generated imagery, while interesting for sure, feels literally soulless. But that&#39;s just my opinion.
