As a young artist and animator, I feel that ai threatens us as creatives. Why are we using ai for creative jobs, when we should be using it to help people get better jobs? We as humans should be doing the creative jobs, because our creativity is a staple of our human nature. Please make sure that AI cannot steal creative jobs from hardworking artists like I. We&#39;ve all put so many hours, days, weeks, years into our craft. We didn&#39;t do it to be rendered obsolete by AI. Thank you.
