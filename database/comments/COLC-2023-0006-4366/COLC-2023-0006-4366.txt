Allowing AI to be copyrighted is going to ruin the lives of so many creatives in this country. We will be unable to prove when our work has been scraped for a copyrighted media and we will be unable to profit from our labor&#39;s theft. We&#39;ll loose our jobs, our dreams, everything this country has promised us. The only way for art to be unique, to say something, to be intentional and meaningful is for it to come from the hands of a hard working human. AI being allowed to be copywrit will be the end of this country&#39;s, and perhaps the whole world&#39;s, artistic voice. Artists will not be hired by the people who could pay us enough to live off of our work, and we would have no money to make known our struggle, as thousands of scammers and conmen would flood our spaces and destroy artistic integrity and the trust and community we&#39;ve spent so long building. Sites like ArtStation and DeviantArt--two long-running and well respected art sites--have already fallen to this very type of person, and big art program companies, like Adobe Photoshop, have rendered their products unsafe for small artists without access to proper copyright. Please, I implore you, this will not be good. This will lead to mass artist unemployment, the destruction of an entire field, and the degradation of all the things you love about art and media. This, no matter how much money it may make one person, will destroy thousands. We have to stand with artists. Art is labor, any artist will tell you this, and it is labor we deserve to be paid and credited for. Please, for the love of all the art in America, do not let these AI companies win. Our country will suffer if you do.
