I am an American citizen from Indiana. AI needs regulations so intellectual content from small creators who can&rsquo;t afford lawyers doesn&rsquo;t get stolen and used without permission. The use of AI on websites without the website owner and individual creators permission also floods the database with incorrect examples, because people post terrible things on purpose to confuse the AI program. Everyone has a right to their intellectual property, no matter how small their following is, and they deserve to not be exploited by programs we don&rsquo;t understand the full impact of.
