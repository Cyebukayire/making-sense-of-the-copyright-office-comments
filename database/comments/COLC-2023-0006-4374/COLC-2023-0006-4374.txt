Artificial Intelligence is the embodiment of anti-human achievement, anti-art, and anti-American practices. It robs individuals of their agency in favor of corporate exploitation, devalues the work of artists, and reduces human beings to numbers in an algorithm--all for the sake of cost-cutting, haphazard and unimaginative executives who don&#39;t understand how to fairly compensate human beings for their rightful work. Personal identity--much less the concept of copyright-- would be torn to shreds if AI is not swiftly regulated for both individuals and corporate entities. Please do not let the like-minded geniuses behind NFTs, cryptocurrency, and now Artificial Intelligence ruin whatever remains of American art, culture, and privacy.
