I believe that AI is a newly developing technology that is impossible to slow down. Instead of stopping it&#39;s developement, it may be more useful to adapt to it and use it. However, I believe there are some exceptions to this, namely voice acting and deepfakes. I believe deepfakes are already developing to an unsafe degree and should have harsh punishments for attempting to imitate someone or use identity theft. Similarly, taking an actors voice and manipulating it to say things that they do not approve of should be heavily punished. By setting a harsh precedent, this can hopefully put off those trying to use AI to do harm. I believe it would be fair if large companies had to pay artists in order to scrape their art off the internet. The AI models.
