I believe AI in it itself is simply a form of plagiarism. It&rsquo;s entirely dependent on input (often stolen from online without the artists and authors consent) that others have created. It itself is unable to create without the already existing template of others works. Unlike a human being who can take an idea and apply there own opinions and outlooks on literature and art a machine is limited by what it is told to do. It&rsquo;s a copycat. Therefore, plagiarism. It has no legal standing.
