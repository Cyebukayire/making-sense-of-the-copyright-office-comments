Artificial Intelligence for art and voices have been advancing rapidly in recent times. It is very disturbing that our very own voices or form of expressions are being used to train, or at worst replicated for selfish or greedy gains. I sometimes fear of answering the phone in case my own voice is being recorded to train A.I., and later replicated to maliciously affect loved ones through scam calls. The entertainment industry, companies, &amp; individuals, especially in the internet, should not have access to record or use my voice under any circumstances. It is not only immoral, but also devastating to think that a stranger may have my likeness for commercial or personal gain. To put it into perspective, our voices can be replicated to say things we never plan on saying, or even be used along a written script to roleplay for sexual pleasure.<br/><br/>As for art that is drawn, painted, or digitally produced, similar points and scenarios can be applied as well. Some forms of training for A.I. can include, but is not limited to, artwork produced by hardworking artists trying to make a living, pictures or videos of ourselves through social media, pictures or videos of us taken in public spaces without knowledge or consent, or picture/video filters provided by companies/individuals in applications or programs. The thought of our, or others&#39; likeness being used for malicious intents should never even cross our minds, but that is the present we live today.<br/><br/>To conclude my thoughts, I personally believe that A.I. still has the potential to become a tool that eases our workload. A tool, however, should not give us instant results, especially one that is trained directly/indirectly from us our our work. If A.I. is ever to be considered as a &quot;replacement&quot; for workers, artists, hobbyists, and other individuals, then it should be subjected to the same, if not more, restrictive laws we all follow.
