AI can be a very useful tool if trained properly, but as it stands, the learning that these programs go through is both biased and built off of theivery. Skilled professionals are having their styles scraped by an algorithm to create &ldquo;art&rdquo; without any compensation to the artist. This must be regulated and the power put into the hands of human creators and protected by copyright. Thank you for your time.
