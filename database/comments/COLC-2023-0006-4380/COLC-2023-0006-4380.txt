I think that AI models should not be permitted to freely train on material as rampantly as they have been. If the models are trained locally on data and images and such provided specifically by those training it with information they have the rights to that&#39;s one thing, but the way most AI is currently trained is scraping whatever it can find online whether it has rights to it or not.<br/><br/>I also think that any sort of AI recreation of voices specifically should be banned completely unless express consent is given, because it&#39;s one thing for images and text to be replicated but voices are one of the most deeply personal things anyone could have, and as such voices should be either entirely originally synthetically generated or when consent is given only for the purposes given. For instance, James Earl Jones recently allowed for AI recreation of his performance of Darth Vader in future properties, but this shouldn&#39;t allow for anyone to recreate his voice for anything outside of Darth Vader. I have seen too often voice actors being attacked for pushing back against just casual recreations of their voices and performances for singing songs they&#39;d never sing or saying things they&#39;d never say, and it is a very dangerous thing to do. Many agencies are trying to sneak consent into contracts as well to get around this. This is one of many things that the current strikes in Hollywood are regarding, and I feel that for free expression and livelihoods of these actors to continue as they have that AI voice recreation has to be perhaps the most strongly regulated part. <br/><br/>In regards to whether I think any of this is copyrightable or not, I believe that, as others have ruled already, it not being copyrightable unless originated by a human is the correct decision.
