Hello, I live in AZ and I am concerned with unregulated A//I because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.<br/><br/>
