Copyright law has been clear for ages- If it is not made by humans, it cannot be copyrighted. AI might take human instruction, but it is not a human who created the final product. AI also only cobbles together things that already exist, and without the capacity for creativity, it is insulting to real copyright holders to claim that an AI can create an original work. AI art and writing is flooding the market and devaluing real artists and writers and true creative work. When two people can write the same prompt and get the exact same result, how could that be considered a true creative endeavor?
