I am a game developer in Minneapolis, MN. We work with many artists but this year one of our artists working on our game was &quot;sampled&quot; by AI and now it is infringing on our designs and work.<br/><br/>The artist did not give permission for their work to be used. We as a company do not give permission for our work to be used.<br/><br/>AI has no place in a discussion about copyright. AI does not opperate with &quot;the sweat of ones brow&quot; there is no hard work other than keywords and stealing artists work.
