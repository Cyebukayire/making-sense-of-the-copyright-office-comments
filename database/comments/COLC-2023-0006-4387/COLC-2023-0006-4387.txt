I do not believe that anything created using an &#39;A.I.&#39; program does not qualify for copyright, which is intended to protect human artistic expression so as to encourage creation. They are no more a unique creation needing of protection than a random assortment of leaves that fell on the ground. This is in addition to the concern that &#39;A.I.&#39; uses data that was created by humans, may be under copyright itself, and is neither credited or acknowledged by any current programmer. I do not believe that any creative or unique expression goes into an &#39;A.I.&#39; created product, it does not need to be protected or encouraged by providing it copyright protection.
