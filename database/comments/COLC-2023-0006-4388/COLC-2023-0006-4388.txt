AI should bot be allowed to train off copyrighted works, and AI art should not be copyrightable. This technology is being used to replace artist&#39;s jobs, and their copyrighted work can be turned into &quot;original&quot; work that belongs to the company using AI. This would be detrimental to the many artists trying to work in this country.
