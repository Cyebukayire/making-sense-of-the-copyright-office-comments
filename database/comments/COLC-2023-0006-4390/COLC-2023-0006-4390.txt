In my opinion if something&#39;s AI generated it should not be allowed copyright rights. Especially for AI art because, the ai that makes ai art it typically trained on stolen art pieces that artists did not consent to have in said training models. Same goes for things sung by AI because that&#39;s literally stealing someone&#39;s voice.
