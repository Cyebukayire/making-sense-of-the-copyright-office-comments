As a writer I have already seen how AI programs such as Chat GPT use my work without permission. I have tested Chat GPT with writing requests in the genre in which I work : scripted family podcasts. The results are clear. The program scrapes my projects and repurposes storylines, characters and tone, even using specific lines of description that I recognize as my own writing. Quite simply, this is not AI. It&rsquo;s a plagiarism program. Without attribution, these programs are clearly violating copyright and stealing intellectual property.
