I am a yet-to-be-published author. The idea of using published works to train AI horrifies me, to be honest. It shows no respect for the work- the time, headaches, and tears- that writers have poured into their pieces. It ignores, undervalues, and stamps on the whole purpose of getting one&#39;s work published: to protect it from plagiarism, wrongful usage, and dishonest gain.  <br/>I dislike the usage of AI to write in the first place- it enables one to seemingly perform a tedious task, all without putting in any effort; but to also profit from the published works of published authors- to rip their brainchilds from their hands and claim the product as your own- is despicable. <br/>If we let this happen legally, we are shooting ourselves in the foot and quite possibly destroying the morale of an entire generation of writers.<br/>Please, I implore you, do not let this happen.
