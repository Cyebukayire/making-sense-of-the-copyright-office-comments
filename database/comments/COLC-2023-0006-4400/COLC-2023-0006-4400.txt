Hello,<br/><br/>Because Artificial Intelligence &quot;scrapes&quot; data from copywritten work (Google search results, images online, fan-created images of artwork, articles, etc) - there is no way that AI creations can be considered original, protected works. When AI uses data, it collects it from multiple sources, often WITHOUT the consent of the original owner. There is very little transparency from AI-generated programs about where they get their images to &quot;create&quot; their works. <br/><br/>In regards to AI-created artwork (written or images), I do not think that AI art should be allowed to be copywritten. It is not original. If someone writes a comic book (original work), they cannot also use AI to create the comic book artwork, because that art is stolen and scraped from copywritten, original material. A person can create. A computer is not a legal person. Therefore, AI art would be public domain. <br/><br/>Here are my answers to some questions:<br/><br/>#9 - Should it be opt-out or opt-in to have your works included in a training set? I believe that training sets should be required to get permission from the artist/writer prior to being able to use their works. <br/># 15 - Yes. Companies/training sets/programs should be held accountable &amp; continue to work honestly and not use works without explicit permission.
