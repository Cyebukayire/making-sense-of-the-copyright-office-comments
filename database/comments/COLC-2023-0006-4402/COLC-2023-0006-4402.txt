Artificial Intelligence created material is theft, pure and simple. The vast majority of &#39;training data sets&#39; that the so-called AIs use to generate their material is harvested from many sources, some copyrighted, some not. They take images, they take words, and they even take recordings of people&#39;s voices to cut apart and rearrange into what they think is being requested of them.<br/><br/>At least one political ad has been created with an Artificial Intelligence-crafted voice of the President saying things that he has never said. Hundreds of videos exist with celebrities expressing extremist views they don&#39;t endorse, or talking about sexual fetishes.<br/><br/>People don&#39;t consent to this. They have actively requested that they not be included. Artists have started using programs to make their art unusable to AI data collectors. They shouldn&#39;t have to, but they do. Their creations, the sweat from their brow, the fruits of their labor, are being taken from them, dissected, and presented by a machine program that doesn&#39;t understand the work, only the end result. Created by people who don&#39;t understand the value of the arts to its audience or to its creators.<br/><br/>Also a copyright nightmare. How can you claim you created something when you type in four words and a computer program creates a collage of words and images and sounds for you?
