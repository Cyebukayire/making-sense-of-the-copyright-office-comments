There is a very simple point here. Copyright exists for a reason. And that reason is to prevent people, companies and AI bots trawling, scraping and repurposing creators&#39; work - whether they be scripts, articles, voice, image, facial and other aspects of physical appearance, in fact any creative work, past or present - and reworking/incorporating it into other work in flagrant disregard for existing and enforceable copyright. Any other argument flies in the face of the law, accepted practice and any reasonable ethical standard. In short, it is theft. This year alone I have been asked to sign a waver which asks me to allow a company I contract to use any and all of my voice, words, image and any part of my input to the company to be reproduced, repurposed, across any media, in perpetuity, for any reason whatsoever, for no compensation. Make no mistake, attempts to expand the reach of AI is nothing short of a land grab that seeks to sweep aside existing copyright protections not just for artists, but anyone who makes work that can be exposed to the internet.
