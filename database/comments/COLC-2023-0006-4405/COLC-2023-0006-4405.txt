A.I. art and writing should not be eligible for any copyright protections. These algorithms and programs cannot create work on their own, rather they must be fed artwork made by human artists. The &ldquo;art&rdquo; that A.I. produces are amalgamations of everything it&rsquo;s been fed, directly copying and pasting portions of the work into a supposedly new piece. The work it uses is copyrighted, directly infringing on the rights of the artists. This means the work produced by A.I. cannot be copyrighted because it is using protected work, and it cannot create artwork on its own.
