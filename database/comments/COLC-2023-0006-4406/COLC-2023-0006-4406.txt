I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in this topic and its request for public feedback.<br/>I am a regular citizen, an artist and writer, and a fan of many creators of creative works, whether they are professionals or hobbyists. To my knowledge, copyright laws in America grant creators exclusive rights to their own work for a set amount of time- usually their lifetime, or at least several years. The creation of public AI that is trained on copyrighted material without compensating these individuals clearly violates this copyright contract, which has always enabled authors and artists to continue doing their work.<br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the consent of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.
