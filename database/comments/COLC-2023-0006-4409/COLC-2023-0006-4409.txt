AI makes me uncomfortable as a citizen of the United States with an online presence. I am not an influencer, but I post my art and poetry online as well as photos of myself and it makes me deeply uncomfortable that my physical likeness or my art/writing would be used to train an AI. I do not want my art replicated with AI to create more images of a similar style. I do not want my writing to train AI on how to write like I do, or even just to write in general. I do not want my likeness used without my consent to train AI. I have heard of safe images being edited into images not safe for work and this would be mortifying if it happened to me. My heart goes out to all those who have had this done to them without their permission. <br/>I want laws put in place that relegate what AI can be trained on, restricting it to work in the public domain or other such fields. I want to know that my images will not be added into AI if I post them online. If a company is providing AI as a service, I want to know where their images or writing came from to use in training their AI. I think we need that transparency. <br/>I also want regulations on citing AI as a source, so that people can understand that AI was a part of some facts that they are viewing. <br/>As a citizen of the US, I am worried by AI. I worry about how it will effect my life, my privacy, and my art. While it can be a good and fun tool, I don&#39;t want it stealing my or another&#39;s likeness and or work.
