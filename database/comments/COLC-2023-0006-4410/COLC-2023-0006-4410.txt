AI as it is currently being used is almost nothing *but* a copyright issue. The vast majority of people who&#39;s intellectual property - writing, journalism, voice recordings, and various other kinds of art and media - have been used to train AI or as part of AI databases were never given the opportunity to give or withhold permission for AI use of their property, the businesses creating these softwares just took what they wanted. It is an incredibly bad-faith and opportunistic way for anyone or any business/company to be using the current accessibility and connection to people&#39;s work and creations that the digital age has given us. <br/><br/>I don&#39;t really see AI going anywhere good in the future; if current copyright laws are upheld and applied to AI, the lucrative-ness of using it will go away sooner or later. And if people&#39;s right to control how their own intellectual property is used (PARTICULARLY in regards to distribution and profit) gets tossed aside in favor making production of intellectual property cheaper, I think it will prove corrosive to a wide range of industries whose foundation is intellectual property creators and workers. <br/><br/>What exactly do people expect to have happen if no one can count on actually *owning*, in a purely practical sense, their own intellectual property? Why should anyone bother making what they create available if it&#39;s just going to be taken right out from under their name? The whole appeal to even using AI seems to be solely to *avoid* the process of making something, or more crucially, for many writers, artists, and other creators, to avoid having to compensate someone else for making something. AI as it is has a misleading name - it&#39;s artificial, but *not* intelligent. Programmers haven&#39;t made something equivalent to Sonny from the iRobot film, a machine/program able to create independently - AI is software that&#39;s very very good at both *copying* data and then randomizing what&#39;s its copied in such a way that it still makes sense. A simpler metaphor I&#39;ve heard and liked was that what AI does with intellectual property is similar to what a blender does to fruit in order to make a smoothie. <br/><br/>Frankly, the push towards AI seems in my eyes another example of a dangerously unrestrained profit mentality. users of AI bask in the sensation of not having to pony up the time and resources for creating intellectual property themselves, and are very happy to fob off the practical costs of this new model of business onto the wider net of workers and people who would normally be involved in that exact process. But just because someone isn&#39;t personally paying for the cost of what it takes to make something doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s free - there will be a cost to that, and you might find that just flat out paying money for things you don&#39;t want to do yourself is honestly one of the least painful ways to get something with actual worth. Anyone who remembers the vine &quot;This is the dollar store, how good could it be?&quot; can probably get the gist of what I&#39;m trying to say here. <br/><br/>It has always been more expensive in some way or another to have good, well-made stuff. Think about how much better a meal made by a professional cook at a restaurant with access to the best tools and equipment would be, compared to the closest equivalent you could get with cheap ingredients in a kitchen that was installed at a substantial discount. If you are given access to high quality something-or-other, but you&#39;re not the one paying, then who is paying? The meal certainly didn&#39;t poof into existence on it&#39;s own, and this isn&#39;t Beauty and the Beast, so they didn&#39;t teach the stove to operate itself. When are they going to pay? Are they *ever* going to pay, and what happens to parts of that industry that *need* incoming payments to continue making the something-or-other at all? <br/>For another metaphorical example, it&#39;s a bit like bottled water - very convenient, wouldn&#39;t you say? Clean water transported to your location and available for purchase! But where&#39;d it come from? Who was using the source of that water? Is there still enough for them to drink? What if there&#39;s not? Why aren&#39;t the folks bottling and selling the water making sure they&#39;re not taking too much? And particularly pertinent, how much of a problem will this have to become before the buyers/sellers feel bad enough to cut it out? If they never feel that much responsibility for it, then how long can those problems continue before they&#39;re too big to fix?<br/><br/>The attitude towards concerns about or opposition towards AI, is met with disregard for those exact questions on the part of AI developers and users, and a very extreme type of individualism that seems to consider it not the user&#39;s problem if there aren&#39;t any personal consequences on the user alone. It brazenly goes against copyright laws and the spirit behind those laws, and was not made or developed with any other intention.
