I&#39;m going to keep it simple: AI used to generate art, voices, and stories/writing are theft. Many of the companies that use it take without consent and without compensation. They use it to rob people who do the actual work and make it harder for them to get jobs they needs, jobs that they specialize in because many have trained for such a thing.<br/>That and there&#39;s an issue I&#39;ve noticed with people who use chat gpt for academic work (ie school essays and such): they use it to get around actual learning and development of critical thinking skills.
