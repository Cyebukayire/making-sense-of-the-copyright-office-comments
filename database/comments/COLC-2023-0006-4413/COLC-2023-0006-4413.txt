Any A.I.-created work cannot be copyrighted, on the grounds that it is inherently derivative work - something that would be completely unable to exist without the other works it relies on, as they are necessary to provide training data. Any A.I.-based media generators are little more than collage creation engines, as has been documented by multiple independent individuals showcasing comparisons (even down to it stealing signatures when the training pool is too small).<br/>Machine learning programs cannot create, only replicate. No original work has come of them, and none ever will.
