AI SUCKS, and we should not be allowing it to be making art/other creative projects, taking jobs away from people who work hard for their craft. You think our ancestors worked and toiled away during hard lives just for the robots to get the fun jobs that are what we stay alive for? Get out of here. Watch Dead Poets Society and feel something for your fellow human beings
