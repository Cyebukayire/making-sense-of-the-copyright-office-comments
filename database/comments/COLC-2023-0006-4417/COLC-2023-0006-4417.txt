Creativity is a skill that must be earned. Artists, writers, and other creatives work for years to hone their skill and are irreplaceable parts of the economy and, more importantly, our community. They deserve to earn a living like any other tradesperson. Allowing someone to use a program to skim off the creativity of a hard-working individual is reprehensible.  Art is a work of passion, done by humans for humans. Protect the sanctity of that work. Protect our humanity at all costs.
