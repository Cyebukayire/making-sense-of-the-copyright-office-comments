I appreciate the U.S. Copyright Office taking an interest in this, as I have strong opinions on this topic and want them to be heard. I am a supporter of authors and artists, and recognize that art is a fundamental part of what makes us human. Additionally, I believe it&#39;s important to a democratic society to support the creation of art. I am also an author myself, although not published as of yet, and thus have a vested interest in protecting my own future works from being abused to train machine intelligence (a product that I despise and believe has absolutely no right to occupy the artistic world in any capacity).<br/><br/>Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws to &quot;promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&quot; Permitting generative &quot;AI&quot; to train on copyrighted works without fair compensation to those works&#39; creators (read: Authors and Artists) for the Rights to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution. I believe it also speaks to the ethical decay of society that the creators of these AIs feel they are entitled to another&#39;s work to train their soulless machine so they may make money off of someone else&#39;s hard work and creative property by shelling out endless generative works. While an author&#39;s work is under its set copyright time, no AI training should be allowed without formal consent and compensation to the works&#39; creator. To do so without those formalities would violate the author&#39;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement INCLUDES training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training. I would argue this is already included in the Copyright Act, but because lawmakers at the time likely could not have foreseen how far technology would come in this regard, the precise language to prevent it does not yet exist in codified law. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering these comments.
