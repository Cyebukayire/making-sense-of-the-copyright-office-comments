I ask you to please continue your policy that AI generated content cannot be copyrighted, as it presents a threat to all creators to completely remove any human creators from the artistic process. Likewise, please treat unauthorized use of a creator&#39;s work in AI datasets as copyright infringement. If a human makes a certain amount of changes to a creative work, it is being done with intention to create a specific effect. When an AI does it.is done specifically to replace the creative ability of the original creator. It is a clear and present danger to creators and creativity, and must not just be treated like its just another artistic tool.
