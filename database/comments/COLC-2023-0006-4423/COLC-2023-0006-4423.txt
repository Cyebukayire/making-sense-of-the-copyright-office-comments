My name is Dr. Jason Polak (jpolak.org) and I recommend that the copyright office officially make anything created mainly by AI not copyrightable, because it makes use of existing copyrighted works without any attribution. Therefore, AI-made works should be stricken from the domain of making profit.<br/><br/>I further recommend that harsh laws be placed so that AI models cannot be trained using copyrightable material. This includes crawling the internet to generate new content. Too many livelihoods are based upon creating content and AI will make those livelihoods obsolete.<br/><br/>AI will thus act as a wealth concentrator, pushing most of the wealth into the hands of the wealthy tech elite, while leaving most normal people even poorer.<br/><br/>Humans have worked for generations to produce art and entertainment, and without strict laws, tech companies will destroy that industry to take all the fruits of that labor away from the people who created it.
