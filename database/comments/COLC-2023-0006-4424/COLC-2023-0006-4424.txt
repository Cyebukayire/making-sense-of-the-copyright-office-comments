I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my views on a matter of considerable importance to the world of creativity and innovation&mdash;whether AI-created art should be granted copyright protection or, conversely, be designated as public domain content. I firmly believe that the latter option, designating AI-generated art as public domain, serves the best interests of society as a whole and promotes the growth of artificial intelligence and artistic expression in the digital age.<br/><br/>AI-generated art, as a product of algorithms and machine learning, presents a unique challenge to the conventional notions of copyright protection. Unlike traditional works of art, which are crafted by human hands and minds, AI-generated art lacks the fundamental creative agency and intent that underpin copyright law. Copyright laws are designed to protect the intellectual property of creators, rewarding their originality and creative effort. AI systems, on the other hand, do not possess consciousness, intentionality, or the ability to experience emotions&mdash;essential elements of human creativity.<br/><br/>Moreover, AI-generated art often draws upon vast datasets and existing artworks to generate new compositions. These creations are not truly original but rather a blend of pre-existing ideas and styles, making it challenging to attribute authorship or creativity to a specific individual or entity. Copyright protection, which hinges on the identification of a creative individual, is ill-suited to address the collective, data-driven nature of AI-generated art.<br/><br/>By designating AI-created art as public domain, we would foster several significant benefits:<br/><br/>1. Encouragement of Innovation: Public domain AI art would fuel innovation by allowing artists, researchers, and developers to freely build upon and modify AI-generated works without the legal constraints associated with copyright.<br/><br/>2. Accessibility: Public domain status would ensure that AI-generated art remains widely accessible to the public, promoting artistic appreciation and technological understanding among diverse populations.<br/><br/>3. Clarity and Avoidance of Legal Disputes: The ambiguous nature of AI-authored creations often leads to costly legal disputes over ownership and copyright infringement. Public domain status would eliminate such conflicts, providing legal clarity.<br/><br/>Promotion of AI Development: A public domain approach encourages AI developers to create and share their models and datasets, facilitating broader advancements in artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I urge the Federal Communications Commission to consider the broader implications of AI-created art on copyright law and the promotion of creativity in the digital age. Designating AI-generated art as public domain aligns with the evolving landscape of technological innovation, fosters accessibility and creativity, and reduces the legal complexities surrounding AI art.<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention to this crucial matter. I trust that the FCC will carefully evaluate these arguments in the ongoing discussions surrounding copyright and artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>
