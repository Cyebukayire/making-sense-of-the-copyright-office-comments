AI Generated images, audio clips, deep fakes, writing, and any other form of AI generated media needs to be full stop banned until regulations can be made to control it. Such as enforced watermarks, legal documentation of the AI generation. Not only does it heavily impact the world of art and culture, it has already been used to fake evidence in foreign countries, and I would not be surprised if it also has been used in our own court system. <br/><br/>The threat of individuals, or even police, generating &quot;evidence&quot; to sway a judge and/or jury alone should be enough to consider the consequences of allowing AI generation of media being unregulated. Individuals, or police, could even claim a piece of evidence was AI generated, and many cannot tell the difference at a glance. <br/><br/>A particularly creative mind could put this technology to work on even more malicious actions. Such as generating work orders, or warrants, to slip in restricted areas. Normally creating these fakes is tricky. But with AI? The world is their oyster. As funny as the deep fake of politicians playing Mario Kart together is, regulations need to be put in place quickly. Not only to protect copyrighted intellectual property, but to protect ourselves from bad actors.
