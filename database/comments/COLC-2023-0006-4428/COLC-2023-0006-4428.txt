Hello, I am Elijah and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/><br/>This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have no recourse.<br/><br/>Unregulated AI is a threat because it lacks any ability to account for stolen or licensed works. If we seek to use it then we need regulations. Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.<br/>Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
