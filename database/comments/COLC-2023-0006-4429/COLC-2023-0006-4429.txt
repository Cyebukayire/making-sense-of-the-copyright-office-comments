I am both a software developer and an artist. I&#39;ve been able to see both sides of the argument around AI and as of current, there is no ethical use of AI when it comes to art, writing, and copyright. The use of AI is both a security issue and a plagiarism issue. AI takes from people who do not consent to having their work used to train an AI and then puts it all together in to something that isn&#39;t even new. It&#39;s like trying to copyright a collage of work done by other people with their own copyrights and without their consent. I work for a company that is also trying to look into the security risks around AI and its use. Currently, there is NO ETHICAL USE for AI. It&#39;s plagiarism through and through.
