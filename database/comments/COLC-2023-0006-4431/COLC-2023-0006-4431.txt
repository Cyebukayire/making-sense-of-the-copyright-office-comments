I am both an artist and a writer, and am really uncomfortable and saddened at the idea of someone profiting off my work by using it to train AI without my permission. The AI cannot create anything without using something fed into it first, so anything it creates would be an offshoot of the works that were used to train it. This does not seem fair to all the creators who have put thousands of hours into their crafts and generally do not make a lot of money in return. <br/><br/>I believe AI should only be able to train off of work from an opt-in basis, and it should be required to pay decent-sized royalties to the creators of any work it uses to make a profit. I also think that anything created by AI should not be eligible for copyright unless it is fairly substantially contributed to by a human. Copyright was made to protect the things humans have created, for the sake of humans. A person should not be able to gain copyright from something they didn&#39;t create and that was not willed to them.
