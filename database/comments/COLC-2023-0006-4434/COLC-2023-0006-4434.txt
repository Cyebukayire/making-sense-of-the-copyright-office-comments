I am a supporter of artists and writers whose livelihood depends on their craft.  I am also an amateur artist and writer.  I believe it is unethical to train learned language model text AI and model-generated artwork AI on work that has not been given in permission for such purposes.  Specific variations of these AI programs are already being taught on work scraped from websites that did not give consent and were not consulted or notified that their material was being used.<br/><br/>Until these datasets can be built ethically, with understanding and permissions given on all sides, the datasets are rife with potential copyright abuse.<br/><br/>I urge you to consider requiring that any predictive AI currently operating under a &quot;scrape first, ask permission never&quot; philosophy to dump their unethically obtained datasets and start fresh with proper permissions and credit given to the writers and artists whose work the AIs have been trained on.
