I feel that AI has a lot more harm than good to offer. It&rsquo;s already creating problems for theft of content for creators of all types. This includes but is not limited to: visual artists, musicians, authors, writers, and actors. AI benefits the rich who wish to exploit the labor and products provided by the creators who put their life into their craft. It makes their existence null and void. This will not only destroy human creativity as we know it, it will crush our economy. Millions of jobs will be lost and become nonexistent because they won&rsquo;t need to with AI. People who already struggle to make ends meet will be forced out of their industry and lose their income entirely. It&rsquo;s already hard enough to make any money doing something you enjoy. It&rsquo;s already hard enough living in this country. Please do not make it harder.
