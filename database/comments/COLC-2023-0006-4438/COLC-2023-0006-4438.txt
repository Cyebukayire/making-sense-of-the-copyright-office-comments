AI should be used to do dangerous tasks that humans can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t do, and to help the disabled. AI should NOT be used for art and writing because AI is trained to steal from real, human authors and artists. That&#39;s art theft, and people who use AI to make art should be charged as such. There should also be heavy regulations on AI usage.
