I do not believe that AI art generation should be prohibited by copyright.  My logic is that AI functions much as humans artists do when generating art--they look at the art, they learn from it, and they use it (consciously or otherwise) to inform new art.  However, artists must be compensated for the use of their art in training models.  Artists should be able to opt-out of their art being used to train models, and that must be respected.  And they should be able to request removal of their art&#39;s data from previously trained models in a meaningful way.  That may mean using the artists work to negatively train the model, however.
