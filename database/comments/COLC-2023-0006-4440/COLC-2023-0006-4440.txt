No one should be able to copyright AI generated content of any kind. All AI generated content is trained off of other individuals work. At this time, most of that work is copyrighted to the original creator, and using it to train an AI without written permission from the original creator is, in my understanding, already a violation of copyright, and ought to be prosecutable. Even in the theoretical case of an AI trained only on public domain material, the individual who uses the program to generate content still has no legitimate exclusive claim to the source works, and thus has no legal claim to the generated output. As an artist, I consider the use of my art to train an AI without my explicit permission to be theft, and any use of content generated partially or fully using my work as theft.
