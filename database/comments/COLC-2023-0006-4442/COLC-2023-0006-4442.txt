I strongly agree with AI art NOT being able to fall under copyright. AI art is known to &quot;make&quot; its work off of fed and compiled images from the internet. Most, if not all, of these images are from artists who did NOT consent to their works being used. As an artist myself I do NOT want my works being used. It would be heartbreaking to see a piece I worked hard on get spit out by someone typing something into a computer text box. AI made works are most likely sampling already copyrighten works given the unchecked nature of what the computer is allowed to sample on. This could cause further isssues down the line for copyright as a whole. Human spirit and emotion is needed to make meaningful and copyrighted works. I implore you to keep AI out of the running for any sort of copyright, forever or at least until these AI machines are fed non copyright work along with artist consent. AI is a threat to artists and copyright as a whole. Please be mindful.
