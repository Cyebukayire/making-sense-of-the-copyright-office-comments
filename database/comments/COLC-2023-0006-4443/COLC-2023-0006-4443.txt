Look, the &quot;hundred monkeys with typewriters producing Hamlet&quot; thing was a thought exercise.  AI... is not a thought exercise.  AI is a dehumanization of the arts and sciences.  AI has no responsibility to not create something that can injure a living being, be that human or creature.  AI has no morality.  But also, AI has no respect for copyright.  These systems are trained on existing, copyrighted works, often without authorization, and they produce at best poor imitations of real artists and authors - while stealing their ability to make money from their own artwork.<br/><br/>In other words: AI is problematic in its inception and an outright nightmare in its implementation.  Please.  Please don&#39;t let people copyright AI crap.
