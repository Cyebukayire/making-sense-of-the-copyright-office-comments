AI is stealing. You need a wide array of sample work for AI to function properly and at current nobody is getting credit for that sample work. Even if AI starts crediting all sampled work we need protective guidelines to ensure work submit for one project is not reused repeatedly. Workers need protection so we can still have jobs &amp; income if AI is going to sample and replace us. I think AI has potential to be good but not in a work environment. It&rsquo;s stealing jobs and income from a lot of people.
