Much like the intimacy coordinators were finally able to reign in the decades of despicable behaviour in Hollywood, your stand against legitimizing AI makes the US Copyright Office the last bastion of truth in a world fueled by despicable corruption. <br/>While many arguments have been presented as reasons AI is the future, none of them can possibly ring true. Anyone who&#39;s had the misfortune to try to get through an automated phone system knows, there&#39;s no hope for the future of AI.<br/>What studios are actually saying is they have no interest in the next generation of talent. <br/>What does this mean to you? If you decide to permit AI, I will move to theatre. I will still write of course but convert all my scripts into live productions. Good luck CGIing that. <br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion before taking studio money and doing what they command.<br/>
