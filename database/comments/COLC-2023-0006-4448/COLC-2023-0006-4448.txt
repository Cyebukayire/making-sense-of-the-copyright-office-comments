Works made using AI have to pull from a library of existing works made by people. The artists, writers, actors, and other creators currently aren&#39;t being compensated from their works being taken for AI training. As it stands, the way AI is currently used could render the concept of trademarks and copyrights fundamentally useless.<br/>Any creator whose work is used towards creating a commercial product or service should be properly compensated.<br/>And that&#39;s not even getting into the fact that AI in commercial settings are being used to replace real artists. Thus reducing jobs rather than creating them.
