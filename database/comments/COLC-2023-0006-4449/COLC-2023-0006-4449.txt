Generative AI are concerning and harmful to a wide variety creative job workers. Contrarily to a human brain, which elaborates information and creates something new by using artistic sensibility and intellect, AIs operate without real inspiration, only based on algorhithms that make them cut and copy-paste parts of other people&#39;s creations- copyrighted work and private work both. <br/>As an artist who never agreed to have their work in the LAION database, I was shocked and horrified to see my pieces were stolen and used to train this technology without any kind of request of consent or compensation. <br/>And again, as an artist, I always check if any material I use to study or as reference needs requires a special license to be used. I wasn&#39;t returned this courtesy by the people who created these AI training databases, who took my the fruit of my hard-earned efforts and skills.<br/>I hope you will consider- you, as any other government entity across the globe- to protect intellectual property of human artists of all disciplines, by making AI generated work (including but not limited to images, scripts, novels, music, videos, animations, voice clips) not copyrightable, and making the practise of scraping prosecutable by law.
