Greetings Congress,<br/><br/>What are we, as a species, trying to achieve? I know what I personally am trying to achieve. A country with zero homelessness, zero poverty. A country with an educated and healthy population which can pursue lives of meaning and purpose. Anything else is a waste of time and energy in my opinion. So what does this have to do with the current so-called &quot;AI&quot;?<br/><br/>I&#39;ll get to that but first let&#39;s take stock of our situation as ambulatory piles of sentient atoms living on a rock hurtling through a meaningless and vast cosmos. We are all going to die. We all have only one life, contrary to the baseless opinions of the thousands of faith traditions our species has devised over the millennia. One existence. All of us here by chance, none of us here by choice. All of us equal in one respect, Death. Any of us can die at any moment for a million unforeseen reasons; car accident, mass shooting, heart attack, what have you. In light of our true predicament as animals, living on a rock in space where life comes from death, we owe it to ourselves to think beyond quarterly earnings, and petty squabbles.<br/><br/>Now that I have tempered the mood a bit to an appropriate level let&#39;s talk about AI copyright specifically and AI more generally. Human beings are a species steeped in symbolism and meaning. We need self esteem and purpose in our lives in order to stave off our awareness of the facts of life mentioned above. If AI &quot;creations&quot; are allowed copyright status, forgetting for a moment the stolen work that AI is trained on, Capitalism demands that humans be replaced with a free workforce to increase profit.  This will happen, it is not a hypothetical. I work in the entertainment industry and see C-level people chomping at the bit to automate everything. What will these displaced humans do? You see you can&#39;t replace workers without replacing the society that they live in first. Our society, Capitalist hellscape that it is, where hospitals can and do charge parents for things like notifying them of the the death of a child for instance, is an anti-social, inhumane society. Built on exploitation and corruption. If there is nothing for these displaced humans to do, no way to contribute to society and build self esteem no way to find meaning and purpose, much less eke out a living, we are headed for a mental health crisis the likes of which we have never seen before. If we are not interested in building a civilization for our species in which to thrive and contribute and to express their one life to the fullest extent possible, then I must ask, Just exactly who are we building civilization for? Why have it at all? Why not just burn down all the illusions of our manufactured symbolic society? Human Rights, Nation States,  Money, Government. Just burn it all the fuck down. These things don&#39;t exist in nature we create them for us. not robots. US, human beings. <br/><br/>That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say about that, so go right ahead and take the bribes and give the corporations what they want. Copyrights on unoriginal, hackneyed work which an AI can neither find meaning nor purpose in, while human beings starve on the streets with no way to contribute or to matter. At the end of the day that is what will happen. You see I understand that corruption is not an aberration in government. It is a lever of power and feature of government. And so go ahead fast track us on the road to the destruction of society. Burn it all down. <br/><br/>
