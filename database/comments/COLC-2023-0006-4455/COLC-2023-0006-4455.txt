I was at a wedding and was having a very nice conversation with someone. When I asked them what they did, they said they were in &ldquo;Artificial Intelligence creation,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;You admit this to people? Out loud??&rdquo; <br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence, as it currently exists, and at least as it pertains to entertainment, is essentially automated plagiarism as the basic mechanisms of AI steal from the information available from basically anything written or shared on the internet. Everything it &ldquo;creates&rdquo; has already, in one form or another, been created by someone else. As such, really the only hope we have of AI not simply stealing from every written work in existence in a way that negatively impacts creators around the country and world, is for all AI generated content to be fully restricted from copyright. Prevent any company to use something generated directly from AI for monetary gain. Hopefully we can continue to gain understanding around AI&rsquo;s positive, potential uses, and it&rsquo;s ability to be a tool for both researchers and creatives alike. But we cannot allow it to do the work of human beings or it won&rsquo;t be long before massive numbers of people are out of work and without the thing that gave them purpose in life. As it currently projects, an unregulated AI world is possibly the most serious existential threat that we face and it&rsquo;s impact will be devastating. I believe there are many uses for AI as a tool in the pursuit of human creation, but as it currently stands, it will become the source of all artistic creation at a rate that humanity will not be able to compete with.<br/><br/>I hope this comment finds a thoughtful, open, and receptive reader. Thank you for taking the time to give it consideration.
