I think it&#39;s incredible unethical for AI to be used in an art capacity. If you stole crops from your neighbors garden but made a meal with it, it doesn&#39;t matter if the food is now in a new form, that original food was taken without consent and without proper compensation. It&#39;s theft, period. So for something to be created out of the stolen property and then try to make money off of that in turn, to try to claim what is not even yours as your own, is unconscionable.
