Generative &quot;AI&quot; such as large language models relies on statistical crunching of vast amounts of data created by people, and lacks any creativity of its own. The Constitutional mandate for copyright is to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries&quot;. I have been a professional software engineer since 1987 and it is my considered opinion that generative &quot;AI&quot; does not qualify as an author or inventor, and I am extremely dubious that it represents progress in science or useful arts. I think the course of wisdom is to deny copyright to anything created from generative &quot;AI&quot;.
