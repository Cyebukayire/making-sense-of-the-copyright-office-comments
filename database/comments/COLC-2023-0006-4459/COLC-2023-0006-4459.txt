To Whom It May Concern,<br/><br/>A.I. as it is currently being used represents an immediate threat to all citizens, full stop. <br/><br/>A.I. is trained on data collected without the knowledge or consent of those providing said data, and A.I. has already proven to be incredibly detrimental to all creative jobs: writers, artists, musicians, voice actors, everything from professionals creating published works to hobbyists sharing their creations online. All of us have had our intellectual property used, without permission or financial recompense, to train A.I. and generate profit for the creators of that A.I. <br/><br/>I have had my own writing and art scraped and used to train A.I., against my will. Several websites where I had previously posted art and writing informed users that their creations had been scraped to train A.I., well after the scraping had already occurred and past the point where creatives could protect their works. In at least one case (seen here: https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/25888), the website itself was not aware the data scraping was taking place until it had already happened, and while they are working to deter future data scraping as much as possible, they themselves said that they were not able to guarantee the protection of their user&#39;s works. <br/><br/>I am active in several artistic communities where I have seen artists struggle to protect their works from A.I. For example, professional artists frequently share tips on how to make a watermark that an A.I. cannot remove, only to show their dismay when A.I. programs are updated to remove that type of watermark. A new technique for watermarking or otherwise making posted artwork unusable by A.I. would be shared, and days or weeks later, the A.I. would be updated again to be able to override the new attempts at protecting our intellectual property. A.I. developers are very aware that they are stealing and replicating these works without the permission of the creators, and they are actively working to override the will of the creators in order to steal copyrighted designs. <br/><br/>A.I. has also led to a decrease in business and pay for creatives. A recent, fairly prominent example was the teaser image for the new Fallout TV series on Amazon, which was fairly obviously created by A.I., rather than hiring and paying for an artist (https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/08/25/amazons-first-fallout-show-art-is-ai-generated/?sh=6642c0b11f12). As part of the recent strike, the Writer&#39;s Guild of America (WGA) demanded protections from A.I. being trained on their writing, or A.I. replacing their jobs (https://time.com/6277158/writers-strike-ai-wga-screenwriting/). Entire A.I. books have been written and published in the style of, and under the name of authors who confirmed that they had never written those books (https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/fake-books-on-amazon-drive-authors-to-shield-their-names-from-ai).<br/><br/>Copyright infringement and theft of intellectual property is rampant and nearly completely unchecked in A.I. today. People&#39;s livelihoods are being actively threatened. Furthermore, data used to train A.I. has included personal, protected data such as medical records, private conversations, or information on children (https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-chatgpt-generative-ai-stole-personal-data-lawsuit-children-medical-2023-6?op=1). At this point, not only copyright is being threatened, but privacy and personal protection is also at risk.<br/><br/>A.I. is a massively powerful tool, but it requires powerful controls in order to avoid hurting people. As it currently stands, A.I. is being used by corporations and individuals that are concerned primarily with making money quickly, and not concerned about ethics, protection, privacy, or safety. A.I. absolutely needs strong regulations in order to prevent the theft of any more intellectual property, personal data, or protected information. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and attention.
