Thank you for opening this issue up for public comment. I am a supporter of artists, and I believe that the ways AI is currently used infringe on their ability to support themselves with their art. The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.&nbsp;This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.&nbsp;Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright. I believe that the Copyright Office should impose restrictions that limit AI training to works in the public domain only. Thank you for your time.
