every demo I have used with ai generated images has mutilated water marks on it. these are copy right materials. no image made by an ai should profit from generating images, codes, or people when its based on stealing and giving the option to replicate based on scanned copy right images, code and personal and professional photos. THis will remove quality, creativity and diversity if a company or person can copyright and sell images with no real effort causing losts jobs and demonetization of creatives. any and all AI creative content should require using non copyright database information. people building datasats from their own data, images, and art is fine as it would still require the individual to still create the items the database uses. actors being scanned to have their images and voices used in perpetuity for profit with out clearly stating the terms or intent of what those images and voices will be used for is wrong. this is theft of a very person and should be a fellon. its identity theft in every literal sense. there should be no profit from that exploitive abuse. AI should be better defined as AI requires independant thinking and not just data annalisis and generation with no thought or reasonable process involved. calling all these systems and datasets AI is misleading and preys on peoples ignorance and promotes a system of lies by omissions.
