Hello, I am a video game designer, writer and artist. I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to livelihoods and copyrights. In fact, unregulated AI has already done a great deal of damage due to not only lack of regulations, but because copyright holders have little-to-no recourse.<br/><br/>I have seen widely published books with covers that were created via AI programs scraping art and photographs. Artists are already losing work over this issue, not to mention writers. People are already suffering losses created by the lack of regulation with this technology.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure that this technology is used in the most responsible way possible. Not only that, they will protect the copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever.<br/><br/>Reasonable regulations are just common sense.<br/><br/>I&#39;m currently living in Illinois, but I am concerned about my future should AI continue to go unregulated. I work partially from home, and would be severely hindered both financially and in my creative work should I be unable to continue to do so.<br/><br/>The truest way forward is to regulate AI.
