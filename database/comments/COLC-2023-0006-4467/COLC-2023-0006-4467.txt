AI takes from non-consenting people to recreate their image, their voice, their art, and more. It needs to be regulated, consented to, and moderated. It can and will eventually be used to create strong enough fake representations to put people in legal harm with false testimonies. It has already been used to create pornographic images of non-consenting parties. It will be used for more, and for worse. It is harming livelihoods; artists, actors, writers, creators of all kinds are losing work to stolen content that has been munched down by a product. <br/><br/>There needs to also be protects for said creatives from companies that can and will try to implement clauses about their work being added to AI bots. Disney already mandates that all art done during a creative&#39;s tenure belongs to the company; adding that their personal style needs to be added to the company AI bot is not out of reach.<br/><br/>Please ensure only open, uncoerced AI bot usage. Thank you.
