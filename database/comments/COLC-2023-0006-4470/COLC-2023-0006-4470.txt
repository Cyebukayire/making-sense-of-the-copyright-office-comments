As a voice actor, I&#39;m perhaps a little more concerned about this technology than the average citizen. But my concerns are centered more on their impact on society as a whole than they are on my own job security. As it stands, anyone can upload a few seconds of audio to ElevenLabs to create a generative AI voice model of the person speaking in them. And while it&#39;s not perfect, it&#39;s VERY good, and getting better every day. Without regulation on both the companies developing the technology and the end users they&#39;re giving permission to use it, truth becomes exceedingly malleable. Anyone can put words into the mouths of anyone else, and can convince the masses that those words were spoken. The possible ramifications are horrifying.<br/><br/>On a personal level, as a voice over performer, I&#39;m concerned about what fans are doing with AI voice models of myself and my peers. Because the recordings they&#39;re using to create those models belong to my employers, I don&#39;t even have the power to file copyright claims against this usage right now. And people are creating pornographic content with this tech. It&#39;s deeply unsettling. And, obviously, I also worry about my employers replacing me with a robot that can sound like me, but as I said, that concern pails in comparison with the simple fear of what bad actors will do with the power to literally put words in peoples&#39; mouths.
