Ai programs steal content from real human creators. Stolen content is not just limited to art but also likenesses and voices. Companies that use Ai technology should be forced to disclose where they source their content, how it is used, when it is used, and pay the original creators if and only if creators consent to it being used. If said creators do not want their content to be used, the companies should be forced to purge all files created with said content. Furthermore, there should be a way for people who&#39;s likeness has been created via these Ai programs to to have their likeness removed.<br/><br/>As for copyrights of the Ai generated content, no human created the Ai content, therefore it is not applicable nor should it ever be. Typing a prompt into a program does not nor should ever count as creating something original and copyright-able.
