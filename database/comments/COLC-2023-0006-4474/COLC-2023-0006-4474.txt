Thank you for looking into these important issues. AI has mechanized inference so that computers can now copy original work in an automated way. Copyright laws must require AI to own the copyright of the material they use or creators have no legal basis to protect their work, and monetize their efforts. For an AI to license it&#39;s work, it must either have unrestrictive rights over all creative works fed it, or it must be able to attribute its work and have appropriate sub-licensing agreements with the original creative authors. <br/><br/>Best regards,<br/>Jeff Vroom
