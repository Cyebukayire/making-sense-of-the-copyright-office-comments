AI-generated content cannot be copyrighted, as no human had a hand in the work created. Except, of course, the stolen work from humans that mercilessly become fed to AI machines without consent and care for the original work. Any laws created around AI should be protective only of humans, not of an unthinking, unfeeling machine that can only make general copies of whatever information is fed. Our nation is for the free, the thinking, the great, and the creative. We support great artists in the past with museums and accolades, yet with our new artists, a demographic that seems ever-growing, we spit in their faces and steal from them. We take entire books, paintings, and illustrations. We have code make a copy because we can&#39;t afford to pay these artists - of which are still alive! I would take care to be wary of who you really want to protect here - the living? Or is it corporations?<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
