I believe that artists, writers, and other creators should be compensated fairly for any usage of their creations in AI training as well as be able to refuse having their creations used for training AI. It is not fair that people who have spent time practicing and honing their craft are being taken advantage of and having their works used without permission. Sadly, I do not have any ideas in how compensation or refusals for materials to be used could be implemented. Any material created solely through the use of AI should not qualify for copyrighting as theoretically an AI could produce the exact same work for another person. There has to be some element of human creativity involved - some form of editing or change to an AI produced material. This does not mean adding additional instructions or &quot;prompts&quot; to influence the AI, but instead an actual person in some way manipulating the AI produced material to make the material no more than 80% created than the AI.
