As a creator of written, and audio media, I do see the value of ai in creating content.  It absolutely is a tool that needs to be embraced, HOWEVER, art, literature, music, created solely by an AI. or mostly by an AI, I feel can not be defined as unique.  The most unskilled artist, given enough time, could come up with a prompt that creates very similar results, that were not ai created would be labeled as derivative/parent works.
