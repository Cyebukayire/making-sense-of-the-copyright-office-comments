What is the purpose of copyright? Is it to enforce &quot;intellectual property&quot; to the detriment of culture, or is it to provide a creator with the ability to profit from their creation for a time? When the laws were first written, it was absolutely the latter. Now it is by all accounts the former.<br/><br/>To be frank, copyright itself is utterly broken. It benefits only the powerful and deprives our society of its own culture and stories.<br/><br/>I fear for a future where this entire debate about machine learning leads to one horrific conclusion: that observation itself is a copyright violation. That merely seeing something you do not own the intellectual property for and have no paid for is a crime.<br/><br/>I fear for a world where the only people allowed to create new things are those with the money to afford an army of lawyers, while independent creators are sued into the ground because their creation clearly &#39;copied&#39; something that already existed. Today, that would be considered &#39;inspiration&#39;. Tomorrow...it could be theft.<br/><br/>That is why I do not believe the argument that machine learning observing art is &#39;stealing&#39;. Because the moment observation becomes copyright infringement in any form, it opens the door for a cultural dark age.
