As things generated by machine learning ,which is what these &quot;AI generated x&quot; services are using requires trainimg based on existing materials text or images, which themselves may be public domain or copyright protected, I belive the only reasonable way to limit theft and abuse intentional or accidental is by makeing the products of these systems unprotected by IP and Copyright law. As it is now these companies and services scrape image boards, text and writing based websites etc without limit and train these algorithyms on publically viewable materials with no permission or contact with origional creators of the works they copy.
