AI is theft, pure and simple. It is trained on other people&#39;s written and illustrative works without those people&#39;s permission. I think AI should be heavily regulated. I do not think AI should be allowed to scrape content either for data extraction or for training purposes without written consent of the person whose data is being scraped.
