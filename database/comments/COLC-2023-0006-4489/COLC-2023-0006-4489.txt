I am a graduating artist. My future career is already uncertain, with the state of the animation industry as it is, what with the poor working conditions and poor pay often seen. AI work only worsens my (and others) chances of getting hired and staying employed. <br/><br/>AI &quot;art&quot; takes actual pieces, most often without permission, and creates a render based on actual pieces. Studios will have another opportunity to exploit their artists. Actors may be replaced with an artificial version of themselves. Writers will be replaced in script writing. <br/><br/>All of us will suffer, for the benefit of companies and organization who don&#39;t care about their employees. The work that is produced will be of lesser quality, and mass produced. <br/><br/>AI is inherently inhuman; it steals from other artists in order to create their works. AI works should not be protected under copyright law. There needs to be regulation laws surrounding AI, especially to protect those under whom its development affects the most.
