To whom it may concern: <br/>I would like to thank the office for their actions in listening to the public opinion regarding the use of copyrighted works to train AI. I am strongly opposed to such actions. While I am not a published author or artist, I do support them. AI scraping of copyrighted works violates the law regarding copyright, as copyright isn&#39;t something that the AI is trained to detect. This means that they would be scraping works and taking money from the artists and writers pockets. Works that are in the public domain are fine to work with, but that hasn&#39;t been the experience of many authors or artists online, as they&#39;ve had to design tools to avoid their work being stolen. Our current copyright policy was designed to allow artists to have complete control over their IP and allowing generative AI to scrape it robs them of their control of their IP and renders their copyright basically null and void. <br/>This office should adopt policies that are fair for both artists and authors, and not allow their work to be taken from them by AI.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
