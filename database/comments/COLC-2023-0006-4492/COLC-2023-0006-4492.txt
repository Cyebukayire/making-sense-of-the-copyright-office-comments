AI by its nature is about gathering information from various sources and making something that combines aspects from these works to make one thing. More often then not, this involves taking media, that does not belong to the person using the AI program to begin with, and making something that greatly resembles some of the original work that the AI took from, all without credit. Because of this it is easy to see how many individuals and organizations are not pleased by the use of AI since many of them believe that it is violating the copyright of their work. There is also the argument that AI is immensely unethical because of its taking of others work and for replacing people-oriented positions with an AI for the purpose of cutting costs.
