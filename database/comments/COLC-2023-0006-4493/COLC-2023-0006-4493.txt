Allowing AI to be copyrighted would not only destroy tens of thousands of jobs across the country, it will kill any sense of creativity left in this world. Do not allow this to happen, it&#39;s cruel and unethical to the thousands of years of artists who poured their blood sweat and tears into their lives work, only to have it shamelessly stolen and flipped for profit. Those who use AI do not care about expressing themselves or sending a message, they only care about their own greed and the maximum efficiency to get rich quick. So please, stop this movement before the beast escapes pandora&#39;s box.
