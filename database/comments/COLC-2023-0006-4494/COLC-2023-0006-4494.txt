Hello! I am a working American voice actor (non-union currently) and have been working in this field for over a decade at this point. While I can acknowledge how AI technology can be a useful tool, especially in the case of accessibility uses, my experience as an actor working while these tools have emerged has given me a rough showing of how these tools can be used in some pretty bad ways. I have known many colleagues who have had audio of their voices downloaded and dumped into voice cloning software, without knowledge or permission, and used to fake voice clips of them saying awful things, or putting their voice to content instead of hiring them. I myself am currently trying to figure out if my voice has been ripped and used in NSFW content without my consent. Not only are individual bad actors doing this, but companies are also looking to abuse this tech as well. Having your voice stolen not only hurts working voice actors, taking away jobs that we could be working, but it is incredibly and deeply violating to hear your own voice saying things you never actually said. I realize this is more about visual art and copyrighted materials but I strongly recommend implementation of protections for actors like me. Our performances are our art, our income, and we need protections from these AI programs just as much as photographers and digital artists do. Thank you for your consideration.
