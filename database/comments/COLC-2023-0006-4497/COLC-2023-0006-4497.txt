I believe that the use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a horrible thing to use because it is only pulling from created works and mashing them together. Many that are copyrighted that is being circumvented. With the use of AI, there is nothing new being made without being something before it. The laws of copyright should not be applied to any works that are made OR derived from AI or any computerized generation in the process of it. If someone wishes to make a piece of art pulling from Disney&#39;s style and pulls pictures of Disney&#39;s property to make their own by mashing them together, is it truly that person&#39;s work? Or is it Disney&#39;s copyrighted work being used and nothing more? What if it&#39;s a play or a movie being used and generated by this AI using a Disney movie? The plot would become the same or similar enough to know where it stole the work from. Many people&#39;s artworks have been stolen from this and people are selling it as their own despite doing nothing but ripping off of another person. <br/><br/>With this, I believe there should be some solutions. Which is that: <br/><br/>1) AI works have no copyright protection, it is automatically public domain because computers are not people. People cannot profit off of the copyright or license because there is none from the computerized generation to make that happen. <br/><br/>2) There should be a law that forces the Artificial Intelligence Website to SHOW on the image or written work, AND their website WHERE they pulled the works from. So that if it has been illegally used then those who have had their work stolen can take legal action on the site from the unauthorized use of their content. Especially because that&#39;s how these sites get away with it. They use so much from many different artists from many different sites and places that you can&#39;t tell where they&#39;ve been targeting. But if there is a place they have to cite where they&#39;ve been pulling from, it lets people and companies either opt out, or take legal action. As well that if these sites don&#39;t follow to cite it, they would get a fine and up to getting their website pulled.
