Ai generative programs are clearly stealing and using intellectual property and copywritten material. The people on the ai commity all have high high ranking positions in the tech industry and only stand to make more money by bettering ai programs and avoiding paying standard wages for skillful people to create what they need. People train hard and spend hundreds of hours learning these skills and should be paid for their services as with any occupation. Even if we could avoid the theft that these ai companies have already committed, we should be giving these jobs to people, not programs. People want and need jobs. Companies shouldn&#39;t be avoiding paying people livable wages just so they can make more margin.
