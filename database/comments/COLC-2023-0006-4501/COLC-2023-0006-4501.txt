AI art is a plague that attacks creators and the people that create the absolute best, most meaningful pieces of media, in favor for something faster. Artists struggle enough and without proper protection they&rsquo;ll only struggle more. AI art leads to not only worse overall media, but a soulless collapse in a culture. Intent is part of the true beauty of art and that&rsquo;s something AI can never replicate. Beyond that, by protecting artists, you can preserve the sanctity of creation. In conclusion AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; is fit only for a society where culture is meaningless, and where joy is only found not in what is created, but in the speed at which it is created.
