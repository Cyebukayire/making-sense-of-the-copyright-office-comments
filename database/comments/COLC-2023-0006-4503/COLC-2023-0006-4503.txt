AI needs to be strictly regulated.  Current AI is not true &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;, it just takes from existing work and is trained to mash it all up into &quot;new&quot; sentences.  But it can only create out of the ideas it scavanges off of, it cannot create any new ideas of its own.  Therefore the only way it can truly succeed is if it continuously steals from other peoples&#39; work.  There has already been documented cases of writers whose work has been taken and fed through an AI, and then others made a new book using that AI and published under the original author&#39;s name.  The AI user profits off of the work and name of the author, while the author struggled to get the fake work taken down.  There needs to be laws in place that protect the rights of these authors and other creatives.  AI is nothing but a leech on human creativity.  If AI is allowed to continue as it is, true creative people will become discouraged and stop publishing their work, which would then cause AI to be stuck in an endless stagnant cycle with no new work to train on.  We all take time to enjoy the work of some creative person, whether it is art, writing, shows, movies, etc.  If we want to continue enjoying their work, then we must protect them from these digital thieves.
