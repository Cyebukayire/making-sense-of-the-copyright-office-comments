I am not comfortable with AI being trained on copyright material. The point of a copyright is to same that this is mine, my style of art, my work that shouldn&#39;t be copied. AI can&#39;t create new things, it can only make things from what it&#39;s been trained on, so using copyrighted material to train AI, is the same as copying someone&#39;s art. This goes against the principle of copyright and shouldn&#39;t be allowed.
