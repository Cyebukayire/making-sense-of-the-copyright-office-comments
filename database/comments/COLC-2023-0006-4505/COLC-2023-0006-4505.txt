As someone with many friends that are going into the art industry, and an artist in my spare time, I think AI-generated content is not able to be copyrighted as it takes work that humans have made and simply creates from that, it does not make anything new besides mashing what it has been trained on together. These AI works constantly take the opportunity from many people to work for companies that need this work done for them, throwing away jobs from people that could benefit from them.
