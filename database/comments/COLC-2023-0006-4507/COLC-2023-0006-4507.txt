I don&rsquo;t approve of the way AI is being used to steal from artists and take the place of people doing honest work. AI draws on real things without consent and is basically stealing identities and art. It needs to be heavily regulated instead of being used freely because it violates people&rsquo;s privacy and freedoms.
