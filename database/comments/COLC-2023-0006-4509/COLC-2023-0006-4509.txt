I urge you to protect the jobs, rights, and intellectual property of individual humans, over AI and organizations. A writer should not have to compete with a machine and a business should not have the option of using an AI in place of a writer. Similarly a persons likeness or voice should only be used with their express permission, they should receive payment. An actor or person should not lose control over the use of their voice or likeness and signing away their voice or appearance should not be required for a business deal, allowed against their will, in small print, or as part of some form of quid pro quo. I hope that society will have the wisdom to protect ourselves lest we all find ourselves obsolete and let convenience and wonder trump the well being of our society&rsquo;s people.
