There are many issues to consider regarding AI, one of which is the fact that other people&#39;s art/writing is used to train the AI. How would copyrighting something that the AI creates work when whatever it creates uses someone else&#39;s art/writing, which, on top of it already being a sketchy thing to do, is also sometimes already copyrighted? It would be like claiming ownership over someone else&#39;s work. If someone else&#39;s art is fed to the AI, it stands to reason that whatever the AI produces should belong to the person whose art was fed to it, but that raises another complication because sometimes, more than one person&#39;s art is fed to the machine. Under such a circumstance, whom should whatever is produced belong to? Even if whatever is produced was to be copyrighted under the names of all the individuals whose art was fed to the machine to create it, what happens in the instance where one of these individuals decides that they want to monetize the piece created and the others decide that they don&#39;t want to? They all would have copyright ownership over whatever it is, and even in the event that they all agree to monetize whatever is produced, what decides who has more say in it than the others? The whole thing just seems like it would be a court nightmare. There is also the issue where corporations are trying to replace artists, actors, and writers with AI. Some are scanning actors without even explaining why or even lying about why, and putting clauses into contracts that give them ownership in perpetuity over someone&#39;s likeness, like the person is an object for them to own, which means that they get to use the scan of the actor/actress in question in movies and other things whenever they want and for however long they want without paying the actor/actress in question. These are a few of the reasons why I believe that AI-generated material should not be copyrightable. It uses someone else&#39;s belongings, it would be theft.
