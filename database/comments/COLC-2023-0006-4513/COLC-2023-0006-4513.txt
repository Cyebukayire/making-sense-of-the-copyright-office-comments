While predictive text models and model-generated art have interesting potential, the current models were overwhelmingly made using datasets including art and writing that was not properly licensed before its inclusion in the data, violating the original artists&#39; and writers&#39; copyrights on their own work. This issue has also occurred with likenesses and voices for actors, both live action and in voicework. For there to be ethical uses of these tools, they must first be trained exclusively on data sets that they have the right to use, whether public domain or through proper licensing of the work. Second, work generated wholly by these models should be considered uncopyrightable and in the public domain, as the model is compiling components based off its dataset and is not an artist or writer in its own right. It is a tool. Third, work produced by these models should be labeled appropriately, to prevent misinformation (such as ChatGPT giving &quot;facts&quot; that are actually untrue) and situations such as entering competitions with model-generated artwork.
