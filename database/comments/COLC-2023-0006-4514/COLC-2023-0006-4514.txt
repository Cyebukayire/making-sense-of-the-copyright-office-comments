I am a voice actor that works in the highly niche field of English Language Dubbing for television, videogames, and movies.  I am concerned that my voice will be used without my consent to train AI to replace me as a worker.  We see now how desperate the producers are to do this, as they have allowed the strike to carry on with the WGA for four months now. They want to do this to cut humans out of the right to earn the money that they helped generate.  SAG-AFTRA has attempted for years to negotiate residuals on streaming platforms in good faith, and studios have refused to give on that so they can continue to brag about record-breaking profits.  Now they want to brag about how much money they make without spending it at all.  If something is not done to protect human labor, the economy will stagnate entirely.  We know that the rich do not allow it to trickle down.  The tax breaks have not helped the economy&ndash;instead they take that money to invest into real estate that they inflate the cost of for the purpose of renting.  If you think the homeless population is bad now, wait until no human is able to work.  They are already replacing us with robots in stores with self-checkouts, they keep staffing as bare bones as they can to maintain the impossible bar they have set for themselves. And the moment they have a chance, they will cut us out entirely.  Please protect humanity&rsquo;s right to work.  Please protect me from the companies that believe they can do literally anything they want with my voice just because they paid me $150 10 years ago.
