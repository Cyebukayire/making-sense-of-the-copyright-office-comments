I am deeply concerned with how AI affects the job market for visual artists. I myself am not an illustrator, but a great deal of my friends from college are, and I pay them quite well for the illustrative Works they do for my career as a musician in the form of CD covers and the like. AI is being used by other musicians like myself to completely cut the artist out of the equation, but these intelligence models are being trained by unethically and sometimes illegally sourced material from artists like my friends. And now ai is being used to create deep fakes of real people and it&#39;s putting words into people&#39;s mouths and eventually this is going to get used for misinformation campaigns. None of this should be legal. It should not be legal to use AI unless it is being trained exclusively with works an individual or organization owns the rights to, and even then I still feel the ethics are questionable. Copyright law needs to be amended to protect artists from having their work stolen, and to protect individuals from having their voices and faces stolen.
