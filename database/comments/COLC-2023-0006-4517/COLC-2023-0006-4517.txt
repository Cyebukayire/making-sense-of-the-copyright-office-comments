AI art that has data built from ripped assets that they did not gain permission from the copyright holders should be illegal. It is not fair that a bot can scrape my portfolio website to steal my artwork to train a robot to make artwork that looks like my work without my consent. It&#39;s frankly unethical. I also don&#39;t think websites should be allowed to make content scraping part of their terms of service. There should ALWAYS be an opt out clause for personal data being used for AI, and it should not be opt-in by default!
