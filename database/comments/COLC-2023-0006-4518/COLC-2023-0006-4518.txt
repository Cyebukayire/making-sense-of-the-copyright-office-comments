First of all, if you understand how AI works, you would know that none of this is workable. You can&rsquo;t use AI To create new ideas, ai is based on the last. There isn&rsquo;t any creative value to having ai do anything regarding any kind of writing or story telling in entertainment. I believe there should be laws made against any type of approach to use Ai to replace humans. It&rsquo;s inhuman if you ask me. People rely on these jobs to feed their kids, they pay dues to a union that is made for this exact reason. Nothing is creative as the human mind, especially a computer that knows only what you tell it.
