It is time to move beyond copyright and intellectual property. Every form of creation is ultimately derivative, we all build upon what others have built in the past. The concept of ownership only makes sense when applied to scarce resources. Nobody owns ideas. The very concept of copyright is now obsolete thanks to technology, and we are left with these archaic unenforceable laws. Rip off the band-aid, abolish all copyright.
