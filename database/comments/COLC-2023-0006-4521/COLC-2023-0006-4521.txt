AI generated works are entirely based off people&#39;s works with zero permission. Many artists, including myself did not give any type of permission for companies to use our works for training and feel this entirely violates our work and also our will. Some companies like google are not even allowing for opting out, they&#39;re just using our data and images that they stored without any permission what-so-ever.<br/><br/>These images are stolen as far as I&#39;m concerned and we&#39;re seeing another instance of Napster, where artists are being stolen from and now profited off of by large corporations and the users who use these generators. <br/><br/>The users and corporations are not creating anything themselves, they&#39;re not making anything unique as it&#39;s based off of the work of real artists and it should not be allowed any copyright, nevermind should companies or anyone be allowed to use artwork created by real people for learning or generation.  <br/><br/>
