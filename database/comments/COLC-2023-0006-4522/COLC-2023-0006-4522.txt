AI does not produce anything original. It takes existing work, often taken against the wishes of actual human creators, and makes a composite. This is not creativity, it&#39;s not art, and it has no business demanding intellectual property rights. Anyone trying to pass off AI generated images as their own art is a thief. Anyone using AI to write their papers is plagiarizing. Imagine going to a restaurant and ordering a meal, then claiming that you were the chef once your meal reaches your table, simply because you told the waiter to tell the chef to take out an ingredient and add another. You never entered the kitchen, your hands never chopped or seared or simmered. You don&#39;t even know how it&#39;s seasoned. The audacity.
