Hello;<br/><br/>As a writer and an artist, I truly believe any work created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) should not be eligible for any type of copyright whatsoever.<br/><br/>When I create a work of art of any sort, I am creating something with my own two hands. I am taking the time to create it, edit it, and work on it until it is at a level in which it shows my thought process, emotions, and all my inspiration to make something that is unique, new, and shows a new angle with whatever type of art I&#39;m trying to make.<br/><br/>However, what AI does is simply aggregates a large amount of data, compiles it in the way a program tells it to, and then spits it out. There is nothing new created. There is no editing, no fine tuning. There is no unique thought, or synthesizing of ideas to push the art piece in any meaningful direction. It leaves the work created by AI simply a replication, like someone taking several mish-mashed pieces and tracing over them and trying to say it&#39;s new; or like someone taking several slices of different flavored pies at a bake sale, putting them in one pie, and saying they made a fresh pie for everyone to buy. It is not anything new, or worth being copyrighted - especially as in most cases, AI is trained off of copyrighted data. So much information in these large data sets that make AI is not willingly given - but scraped from various websites and online sources to be used. It means that before someone gives an AI bot a prompt to make something, it is already using data that is stolen. This makes it impossible for me to believe that AI makes anything that could be copyrighted.<br/><br/>On the note of data sets being full of copyrighted data - again, it is one thing if the data is given willingly. But in many cases, it is not. Nearly every free news outlet was scraped for all of it&#39;s content to feed into AI bots in order to train them to make more pieces. Getty Images was also scraped to go into algorithms that would make pieces. Because this data is stolen, it means that those who make these AI bots and feed this data to their machines should be punished accordingly. It is cruel to think that those who want to make AI can simply take whatever they need without repercussions. No one else can do that legally, after all.<br/><br/>Finally - for the programs that AI bots use in order to pull data from to &quot;make&quot; the prompts, this should be fully transparent. Only when everyone knows what is used to make AI prompts can we understand if copyrighted material is stolen and put into these programs, and we can better understand if the information used is correct. After all, if AI is used to make articles or books, it is very likely they could spread false information. In fact it is happening already - foraging books are made by AI prompts people put into these programs, and these foraging books are full of inaccuracies that could get people hurt. It is imperative that we know what data is being used at all times, not only to protect copyrighted works, but to protect citizens from not getting false information.<br/><br/>Thank you.
