I believe any AI made content may not be used as a substitute for real art or artists. Yes you could argue that &#39;someone made that program but at the end of the day it is a program scanning already existing works from writers and artists. I think if AI tools are ever to be allowed to exist at all, it should not be used as a cheap way to get to a finished product. Use them for references sure, but in the end, art should be made by artists, books and such should be made by authors. And AI feels like it&#39;s cheating.
