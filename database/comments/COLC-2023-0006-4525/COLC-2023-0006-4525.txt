I am extremely concerned about the disregard that has been shown for artists&#39; rights and ownership when it comes to AI. It is clear that the technology allowing for this mass plagiarism is outpacing the laws that should curb it, and that needs to be rectified as soon as possible. This is not an artificial intelligence - it is people dumping the work of other people into a predictive generator and then pretending they&#39;ve created something new.
