Artificial Intelligence should not be able to use people&rsquo;s creation without their permission and also should not be able to Copyright its &ldquo;creations&rdquo; from stolen work. There is not creation being made, it is only a collage of random stuff. There are ways AI help people, but the way it is being used right now in the internet does not help anyone. It only creates job insecurity and unemployment.
