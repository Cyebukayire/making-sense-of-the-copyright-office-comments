Upfront and to be clear: I do not believe and accept that an AI can hold a copyright.  <br/>AI, in terms of story, in terms of creating a new and unique expression of an idea, must rely on input and guidance.  Artificial Intelligence is at its core a tool built and trained on a massive database of unique human created material, it will always be derivitive, especially in terms of story creation.  Because that source material contains unique perspecitves, bias, exaggerations and falsehoods that were understood as such by their humans, and by readers (Alice in Wonderland was a Political Allagory) it follows that the AI would carry forward those same bias, exaggerations, etc., as truths. <br/><br/>AI systems will also carry the bias of its programers, whether towards a style of writing, word choices, etc. AI writing can&#39;t create &quot;tone&quot; or &#39;style&quot; it can only mimic them if given enough reference points. Asking an AI to write in the tone and style of Hunter S. Thompson will never get you near to a sequel to Fear And Loathing, becuase it can only ever try to equal that novel, not use it as a launching point for a new iteration of political participatory hybrid literary-jouranlism.<br/>AI is the ultimate expression of &quot;what you put in defines what you get out&quot; of computing...  or, garbage in ~ garbage out.<br/><br/>Again, AI is a great tool, but that&#39;s all it is. Giving AI a copyright would be like having to share credit with Mirriam~Webster because I looked up the spelling of a  word, or sharing a byline with The AP Stylebook becuase I flipped open to the section on writing about social media.<br/><br/>Humans create, computers iterate
