I was a software student who was taught how to build machine learning programs (generative AI). During my undergraduate study, our professor has the class cite the data set used to train and only from an approved database mainly supplied by MIT for educational purposes. If a student created their own data set or used an unapproved set without permission, it was cited as &ldquo;plagiarism&rdquo;.<br/>Plagiarism is, defined by Oxford Universtiy, &ldquo;Presenting work or ideas from another source as your own, with or without consent of the original author&hellip; without full acknowledgement.&rdquo;<br/>As a credible university understands, plagiarism occurs outside of the literature domain. Thus, why &ldquo;generative work&rdquo; must cite and source their training data as it is, intellectual property.<br/>This also defines, if copyright protected AI occurs, the generated result is not the protected product. Rather, the &ldquo;data weights&rdquo; are the &ldquo;product&rdquo; as these weights, trained by private data sets, is the machine&rsquo;s signature. <br/>Similar to a patient product, the following creations from the patient product are not property of the patient owner (eg. Patient food mixer =/= patient smoothie). Secondly, the data weights are unchangeable and unique to the trained machine, this is why I described them as the machine&rsquo;s signature.<br/>As &ldquo;generative AI&rdquo; stands today, some machines are violating already existing regulations, the major two (plagiarism and patients) have clear solutions, outlined by the existing regulations. First, fully acknowledge the property used in data training by having both parties (the property owner and machine owner) agree to shared terms. Second, if a &ldquo;generative machine&rdquo; can be patient or copyright protected, any generated productions should not receive inherited protection as property of the machine. The &ldquo;generative machine&rdquo; is unchangeable once completed due to the data weights being finalized. This defines the machine a tool, not an author.<br/>I hope this explanation helps advise the regulation body&rsquo;s decisions for the future of &ldquo;generative AI&rdquo; use. I also hope this narrows where protections should be placed and the rigidness required for a new technological format/ process.
