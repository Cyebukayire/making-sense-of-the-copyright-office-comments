Please require that AI-generated material, including artwork, actors&#39; likenesses, and other such creations be created using only data that has been acquired with permission. If a person generates &quot;art&quot; with an AI that was trained on an artist&#39;s work, without that artist&#39;s permission, the person has effectively stolen that artist&#39;s time and work to fuel their own creation, particularly if that person plans to sell or otherwise profit from the AI-generated item that they have produced. &quot;Artist&quot; in this instance refers to any person in a creative field, including writers, painters, photographers, digital artists, actors, video editors, and content creators. Going forward, if a producer or studio wishes to use an actor&#39;s likeness after that actor&#39;s passing, the director, studio, or other entertainment company should be required to obtain that actor&#39;s permission to do so before that actor passes. Using an actor&#39;s likeness via AI-generated deepfake footage without their permission is not only theft, but it is a deep violation of their personage, especially if that actor is not being paid for that footage. Furthermore, websites that wish to scrape their users&#39; data to train their AI should be required to obtain their users&#39; permission for such scraping, and the website should automatically opt users out of such scraping; users should be required to opt into any program that scrapes their work to train AI. Any AI trained on data scraped from users without their permission should be destroyed rebuilt only on data scraped with permission from the artists who wish to contribute to such scraping.
