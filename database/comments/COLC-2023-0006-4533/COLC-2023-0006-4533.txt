AI should not be something that is used to write screen plays, plays, movies, books, children novels, songs, or anything of the sort. AI is dangerous and since it &ldquo;learns&rdquo; from things it has been fed like some sort of ravenous beast I believe it infringes on copyright of which it feeds on already completed or nearly completed works made by man. AI has shown on multiple occasions it does not understand the nuances in which people who have dedicated their life to writing do. <br/>This is not to say that I enjoy every book written - but at least I can understand and empathize with the person who wrote it. AI is a college kid who wants to do well and plagiarizes a paper for a good grade. Those kids are expelled or punished severely. Why would we allow for hungry corporations to do the same with writings when they already do not pay them enough nor show them kindness in which they deserve. Trying to take out the &ldquo;middle man&rdquo; will only affect the country in the long run. The more things that happen like this, the more likely things that occur - like the strike - to upset the balance. I am not of any importance to any of you, and I never will be. Writing should be of the utmost importance since we base a lot of selves on something that was written. I&rsquo;m not being religious here - though I could - I am referencing the Declaration of Independence. They wrote that knowing that we would have free will and AI does not feel or act like free will. <br/><br/>It destroys even more jobs that the country desperately needs. It destroys art that has already been blown to pieces because of the attacks on education and cuts to the system all together. It destroys the exciting part of books on whether or not you&rsquo;ll like it or not because someone who is completely removed from yourself is writing something so personal and published this thing for people like you and I to enjoy. I am not someone who is actively happy about where I live nor am I fighting for a side in the long run of this country. <br/>However, you&rsquo;ll know that I am human based on my probable misuse of commas, or maybe I used a word wrong. Maybe I have a run on sentence. Maybe it&rsquo;s too dramatic for you reading it. You&rsquo;ll at least know that behind the keyboard there is living, breathing person. Gender less and obscure as we are behind electronics, sometimes we forget about the billions of lives every day we come across just because of screens. AI rips a lot of this away. AI should not be used any further for anything artistically. I understand it might be used to weed out certain words on documents, but that is just a computer running code. AI&rsquo;s are learning ùò∞ùò∂ùò≥ mannerisms. AI&rsquo;s are constantly learning and that should scare more people - including you. <br/><br/>AI should not be something that someone can copyright because what did they feed to it to make it learn. Plus if it is learning, then who&rsquo;s to say you shouldn&rsquo;t even give the person &ldquo;driving&rdquo; the AI copyright when AI did all of the work, right?<br/>Regulate AI, control the people who can use it, and stop it from taking art away from those who use it for the intended purpose. Don&rsquo;t allow commercials to be written with AI. Don&rsquo;t have museums full of AI artwork. Don&rsquo;t have library filled with AI novels. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time, I appreciate if you&rsquo;ve read this far.
