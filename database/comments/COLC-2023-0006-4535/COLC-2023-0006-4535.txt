AId aren&rsquo;t people and shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to hold copyrights.  Also, most companies trying to copyright work made from AI use copyrighted data to train their models.  It&rsquo;s just matrix arrays with weights that were accumulated from distilled copyrighted or unconsenting works.  The math is just spitting back out what it&rsquo;s already seen but with randomness thrown in so it&rsquo;s not exactly the same.  Humans, take in everything they experience, their thoughts, dreams, and literally the world to come up with their ideas.  AI is only ever trained on the exact things they&rsquo;re trying to create.  It&rsquo;s not new when they do it, just ild stuff with randomness.
