As it currently stands, &quot;AI&quot;-generated works and imagery function simply by doing the digital equivalent of grinding up whatever&#39;s put into their algorithms and spitting out anything that vaguely fits the criteria specified to them. There is near-zero human input in the process outside of the handful of people actually responsible for programming the systems, which already disqualifies such works from being copyrightable under existing doctrine and court precedent.<br/><br/>However, it bears noting that the efficacy of almost every existing model is /also/ based on the illegal use of thousands of copyrighted works, many of which originate from small artists who have no means of recourse. Accordingly, with the current state of &quot;AI&quot;, even works /derived/ from such technologies should not be considered copyrightable, since they are fundamentally built on flagrant and widespread abuse of copyrighted works they were not given permission to use.<br/><br/>Additionally, even if the dubious origins of the datasets used by &quot;AI&quot; is something that is rectified (I.E. by gathering new datasets with works they actually have permission to use), I would argue that &quot;AI&quot;-derived works still should not be copyrightable unless they have undergone /significant/ alteration after initial generation. Copyright holders should also be required to disclose such origins in publicly-available copyright notices.<br/><br/>As a final note, the likeness or voice of an individual should NOT be subject to be fed through an &quot;AI&quot; algorithm as part of a larger agreement; such an act should be required to be a completely free-standing agreement, separate from any other, and should not be allowed to be required as a condition of employment or work, or as a condition of any other legally-binding agreement. No one other than the individual should be allowed to own their likeness or voice without an ongoing monetary relationship, and without the ability for the individual to cease the agreement at any time with no penalties to them.
