Artificial Intelligence can not be allowed to be copyrighted. AI is trained off of other&#39;s work- near exclusively without their consent- and rebuilds others&#39; creative works into an image. It does not create anything new as can be seen by the fact that artists&#39; watermarks can even be seen in AI generated imagery. What&#39;s more is that it is the machine that produces the image itself- not a person. A machine cannot hold copyright, even if the copyright were valid- which it is not as stated previously.
