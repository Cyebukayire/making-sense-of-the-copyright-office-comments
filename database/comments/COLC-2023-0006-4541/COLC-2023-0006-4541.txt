I wholeheartedly believe that AI generated anything should be under HEAVY regulations. As of currently, AI generation has overwhelming been trained on stolen artwork and writing. So much so that my professor from Kutztown University put into his syllabus that if a student is found to have used AI tools to write their reports for lab, it would be counted as cheating and the report given a zero. Because it is cheating off of other people&#39;s hard work and is a more monstrous version of plagiarism. AI can be such a great tool but as of now it is simply not being used respectfully or responsively. I have seen articles that were clearly AI generated and weren&#39;t even checked for errors which could lead to a lot of people getting hurt or worse due to incorrect information. AI absolutely needs some of the strictest set of regulations possible it order to get this whole mess upon mess under control. It&#39;s putting people&#39;s livelihoods at risk as well as putting people at risk for injury.
