As an artist an actor, I find that AI infringes on my useful art. The progress of science and useful arts is dependent on the creation of genuinely new work. What is the point of creating when it will get stolen? And then the cycle of reprocessing past work by AI means that they aren&#39;t really generating new ideas. It will result in stagnation. As an actor I bring a unique viewpoint that is the culmination of my life&#39;s experiences and that interacts with other actors with their own point of view. There is an alchemy to that which AI is hoping to replicate. For example, Robin Williams was an inimitable human being. He moved cinema and TV forward. His likeness shouldn&#39;t be frankensteined by AI.
