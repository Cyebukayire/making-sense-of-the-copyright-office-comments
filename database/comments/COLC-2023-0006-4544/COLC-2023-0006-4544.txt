AI has great potential to be a useful tool in multiple disciplines. But I believe that AI generated creative work, such as art, writing, animation, and others like that should not be touched by auto-generated material. These are the humanities. It will be a useful tool when we utilize it ethically. Laws should be passed so no one can unfairly capitalize on other people&#39;s work. The coding that gets put into it should be recognized as talent, but I feel that AI art should be required to have some unique identifier so that people are not misled. In my opinion, there should be laws surrounding the monetization of these works and they should allow for the already working writers and artists to live sustainably without worrying that  their job and/or passion be snuffed out because someone was able to commodify their individual work. Please do not let this become something that ruins us. I&#39;m begging y&#39;all
