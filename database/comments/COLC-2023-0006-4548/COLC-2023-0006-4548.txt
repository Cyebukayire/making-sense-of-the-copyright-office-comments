I don&rsquo;t see how training AI on publicly available works is any different than a human author or artist being inspired by the works they see or read and reflecting that in their own works. If the artist, or AI system user, creates something that is substantially similar to a copyrighted work, THAT is a problem - but I don&rsquo;t think the training itself is. On the other hand, scraping vast amounts of data from a website, or its APIs, eats up significant resources for that company that they deserve recompense for. At the very least they deserve compensation for the amount of ad revenue human viewership of the same amount of data would generate, or actual operational costs, whichever is greater.
