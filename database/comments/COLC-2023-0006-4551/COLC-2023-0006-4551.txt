AI tools should not be allowed to be trained on any kind of material that they don&#39;t have explicit permission to use or which isn&#39;t explicitly free to use. Using people&#39;s copyrighted material to train AI tools without permission should be punishable by law. People, companies and the like also should not be allowed to claim AI generated material as their own. It should be explicitly stated when AI generation tools have been used for illustrative purposes in animation and other art mediums, social media posts, marketing, packaging and the like, even if the AI generated material was transformed by a human. Companies, organisations and the like should especially be held accountable in failure to do so. Job applicants should also be forbidden by law from using AI tools to build their portfolios, unless the AI tool is theirs and it&#39;s explicitly stated where it&#39;s been used.<br/><br/> If an artist&#39;s work is found to have been used to train AI tools without their permission, they should be eligible for compensation from the individuals responsible.
