So-called &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; programs that use data that cannot be verified as being used with permission of the original creators should not be used in commercial licensing projects. Any licensed media such as books, television programs, films, commercially sold artwork, etc. should either be free of generative AI program use OR have a full list of permissions given by the original artists for their data to be used in said works. Any AI generative program that cannot verify its sources should be subject to litigation or removed from commercial use.
