I oppose issuing copyrights for images created with generative &quot;AI,&quot;for several reasons.<br/><br/> For one thing, the generative models are trained on data that was unethically obtained under the pretense that it was for &quot;no profit,&quot; use. Other data was unethically scraped from art websites, social media, and myriad other places without the prior knowledge or consent of the owners and/or creators of those images. <br/><br/>Additionally the companies that develop these models exploit foreign laborers to train their AI models. <br/><br/>Also, this technology solves a &quot;problem&quot; that doesn&#39;t exist. It doesn&#39;t automate a tedious or odious task. It doesn&#39;t fill a gap caused by a dearth of artists. All it does it take away jobs from people who love their work. Millions or artists and writers face unemployment due to this technology. <br/><br/>Finally, this technology represents a very real risk of cultural stagnation and decline. If creativity and imagination are discouraged, indeed, automated, then what are we really even working for at this point? If these machines put artists out of work, then they will never have new images to train from and will eventually be unable to ever create anything truly new. Human creativity will wither on the vine.
