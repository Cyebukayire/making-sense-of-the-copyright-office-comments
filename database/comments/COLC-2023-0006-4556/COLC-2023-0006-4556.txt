I do not believe AI should be allowed to take artist&#39;s copyrighted work to train. It is using the artist&#39;s hard work to train itself to steal what makes their art unique. Artists already have issues with people not crediting their work as it is. With AI taking their work to learn how they make art, they are straight up taking away the artist&#39;s ability to make money on their own work. I should not be able to type into an app that I want a specific type of art in this style and get it because the AI model stole the artist&#39;s work.
