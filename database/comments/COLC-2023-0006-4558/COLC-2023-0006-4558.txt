Hello, and thank you for opening comments on this subject.<br/><br/>I am an artist whose living depends on my being able to monetize my work and the time I spend on it. While I do not write, I understand the drive to create, and how the means of making a living on your own creations relies on copyright and other protections. There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.  While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.  To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.<br/><br/>Therefore, I think the Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act. Similarly, I think training generative AI on copyrighted artworks and designs without the consent of the artists and designers of said works also violates the Copyright Act. If the programs these generative AIs run on need to be rebuilt from the ground up so they can&#39;t rely on copyrighted works, and cannot rely on them in the future, then I think that&#39;s the ethical and lawful thing to do.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
