Since the days of cave paintings, humans have created art to explore their understanding of existence and share those feeling with other humans. Art comes from the human need to understand and express the truths of our experiences. Art is the artist&#39;s experiences expressed. AI has no experiences, it can only consume the art of others and output a facsimile. Until an Ai can live a life and create based on those experiences, it is not creating, it is mimicking. It is by the definition of its process of creation, a machine built to plagiarize the work of others, The art of humans and the derivative work of AI are not the same thing and should not be treated as such.
