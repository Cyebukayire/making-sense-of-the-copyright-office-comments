Unless a writer, artist, or other creator of content gives their *express permission* for their work to be used to train an AI, Any &quot;AI-generated content&quot; created using their works as training material is a violation of copyright, and should be treated the same as theft. That&#39;s what it is, plain and simple. AI companies take artists work to train their machines without asking or paying, and then charge other people to use their AI, making a profit off of that artist without permission, credit, or compensation. <br/>It&#39;s theft of intellectual property and a violation of copyright. Treat it as such. <br/><br/>Good day.
