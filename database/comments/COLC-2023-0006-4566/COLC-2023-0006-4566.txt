Generative artificial intelligence can only generate what it knows. It can only know if it learns, and it can only learn from content that already exists. If content already exists, someone already holds the copyright, therefore it is copyright infringement. <br/><br/>From an artistic perspective, if it only generates from existing content, then everything is, by nature, derivative.
