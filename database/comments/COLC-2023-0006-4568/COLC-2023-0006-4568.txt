Since AI software is incapable of generating art and other media from its own creativity, it is simply putting pieces of other people&#39;s artwork together to form a conglomerate of other&#39;s intellectual property. <br/><br/>This is distinct from a human&#39;s composition work, as that is a transformative work generated by a human being with creativity and intent, and is specifically made with a purpose of expanding the scope beyond the pieces of the artwork contained within. <br/><br/>Not only that, but whereas the artists that created the original artworks contained inside the composition can maintain some form of connection to the final piece, the sources of artwork for an AI conglomerate piece have no way of gaining credit. The only conceivable exception is an AI software that has severely limited training data that only contains credited work from artists that specifically consented to their intellectual property being used.<br/><br/>Not only does AI conglomerate art not count as fair use in the eyes of many artists, it violates the intention of art and other media on an inherent level. The only way that the latter would not be true is the case in which the AI software itself, and thus the processes conducted by it, are themselves part of the art piece and said art piece&#39;s scope. This is because an AI system did not have a hand in the creativity in this case - a human did, and thus the intention of art as an idea is withheld.<br/><br/>Furthermore, AI conglomerate artwork violates artist&#39;s right to attribution for work derived from them, as their creative ideas and intellectual property are being reproduced and not expanded upon. This is in direct violation of the rights for the individual and/or organization from which the training artwork originates from.<br/><br/>The AI generation of conglomerate artwork, unless given specifically limited scope, does not uphold the intent of copyright as a system, and thus cannot be legally allowed to operate in its current, nearly unlimited scope.<br/>
