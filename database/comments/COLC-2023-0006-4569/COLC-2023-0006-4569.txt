Artificial Intelligence engines are being copied and used so frequently that, as a tool, they themselves are beyond the security of copyright. If the products of an AI are going to be submitted for copyright, they should primarily be blocked as they have no personal effort input worthy of being claimed as intellectual property. Regarding legality, any works of art being published with the goal of being distributed for profit should have a mandatory disclaimer of AI influence, a violation of which should result in both fines and blocking/takedown notices. Intellectual property should be protected as a human right, not sold by producers seeking cheap labor and shortcuts.
