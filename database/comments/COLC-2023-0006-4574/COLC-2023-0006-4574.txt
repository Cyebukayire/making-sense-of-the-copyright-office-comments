I am so concerned about where AI is heading. It is going to wipe out tons of jobs, marketing, secretary work, tons and tons of jobs will be destroyed. Then it will create massive unemployment that the government will have to support. There 20 other reasons there needs be massive regulation around this industry but faster than we understand, companies will find ways to optimize and reduce cost by using AI. As a VP of a company I am already seeing options presented to me for this.
