Thank you for opening up public comments regarding a sensitive and timely topic such as this.<br/><br/>I am a discerning individual who greatly enjoys art of all forms. I believe each and every art form is threatened by the existence and continued support of generative AI; necessarily, generative AI is tool that is and will be used to replace true, human artists, thus rendering art purposeless. The methods through which generative AI arrive at their output are unsavory and sometimes illegal, as we have seen several times over the last year. Artist consent is trampled by companies unwilling to compromise, and I assert that generative AI should not be trained on copyrighted work, nor should the output of such programs be eligible for copyright.<br/><br/>I request that The Copyright Office put in place policies that find the training of generative AI using copyrighted works, without the consent of the artist, to be a violation of the Copyright Act. The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works. The training of generative AI tramples on these lawful principles, and undermines a democratic, well-rounded society. Art and artists should be protected through policy.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
