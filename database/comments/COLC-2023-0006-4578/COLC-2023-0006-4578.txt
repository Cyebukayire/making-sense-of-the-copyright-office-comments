I think we should have tight regulations on ai generated art as it is using references stolen from other artists that didn&#39;t consent to their art being used like this as well as for the writing part as it&#39;s stealing from both book writers, poems, older and modern literature, as well as fan written works which they did not consent to being used in this way either! not to mention the fact that people are using it in middle and high schools as well as to cheat on typing and writing essays as well as any other paper they need to do for grades.
