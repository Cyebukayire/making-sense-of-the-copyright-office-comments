Hello, I am reaching out because I believe that AI generated works of any kind should not be protected under copyright. It is my opinion, but it is a fact that all generative AI uses the works of other creative minds, often without their permission and with no regulation. I find this personally unacceptable, and until generative AI can create original concepts, I do not think it&rsquo;s deserving of such a thing.
