Good evening,<br/><br/>I am commenting my thoughts on the AI copyright issue. To be clear, what is being called &quot;AI&quot; is not true artificial intelligence. The software in question is something that scrapes content from all over the internet and regurgitates it into something else. It is artificial but not intelligent. I think it&#39;s clear from recent events that AI is not capable of creating anything on its own, therefore nothing it creates can be subject to copyright. <br/><br/>A good example of this is that scraping software used by ChatGPT actually drew a lot of samples from Archive of Our Own, a fanfiction website (which you can read about here https://gizmodo.com/ai-chatbot-fanfiction-fanfic-archive-of-our-own-1850524393). At best, any AI generated works are considered fair use. At worse, they are fraud. <br/><br/>I think the most egregious examples of this are the AI generated foraging books on Amazon (which could kill someone) source included here https://decrypt.co/154187/ai-generated-books-on-amazon-could-give-deadly-advice as well as the author who had AI generated works submitted to Amazon under her name which she did not write and did not authorize, source here https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/10/tech/ai-generated-books-amazon/index.html. <br/><br/>In each of these examples (and others) it is clear that the content of the books was taken from another source and regurgitated as something original, which it wasn&#39;t. I firmly believe only content (movies, tv, art, books, etc) that involves human creation should be eligible for copyright. That is all I have to say on the matter.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time. <br/><br/>Alicia Rossi
