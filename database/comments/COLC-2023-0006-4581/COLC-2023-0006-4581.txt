AI that gathers the data and examples of original art of all mediums to replicate a facsimile of creative work has been a crippling blight on all sorts of creators. Many human creators have given up sharing their work with the world and even creating in general as it will be stolen and often closely replicated by &quot;intelligent&quot; programs, stealing aspects of an artist&#39;s work and claiming it as their own. It&#39;s discouraging at best, and it destroys creators at worst. If my creative work is my own and cannot be replicated without my permission, bots should not be allowed to &quot;train&quot; themselves with my work to then replicate it as something &quot;original.&quot; There is nothing transformative or creative about replicating work stolen from me without my permission.
