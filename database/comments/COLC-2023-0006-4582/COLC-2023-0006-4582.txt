It is my firm belief that AI-generated content should not be copyrightable. The simple reasoning is this: in its current iteration, AI cannot create. It can only take existing creations by people and mash them together to follow its algorithms and prompts. It doesn&#39;t take inspiration from its environments to make something wholly unique. Current AI is, in effect, a long-form plagiarism engine. It steals other&#39;s works and tries to pass them off as new creations. If I were to try to glue Leonardo Da Vinci&#39;s Mona Lisa into Van Gogh&#39;s Starry Night and attempted to copyright it, I would be laughed out of the building. AI is no different.
