The recent court decision that copyright could not be granted to a work without &quot;human authorship&quot; is a step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough. While it prevents submission of works that are ENTIRELY ai-generated, the status of works which are PARTIALLY ai-generated would still be in question. It is very likely that wherever or however the legal threshold for &quot;human authorship&quot; were defined, companies would make a practice of riding that threshold as closely as possible and using as much ai-generated content in their works as they are permitted to while still claiming &quot;human authorship&quot;. Use of ai is already much cheaper in many respects than hiring human labor, and is likely to become even more so as technology improves. But these savings for the company will come at the cost of ordinary people&#39;s livelihoods. <br/>Members of the WGA have already pointed out that they are paid significantly less to &quot;adapt&quot; existing stories (such as books or plays) into a screenplay than they are to write a screenplay from scratch. They are concerned that production companies will make use of ai to generate plot synopses which are then handed to human writers to &quot;adapt&quot;. Writers note that ai-generated text is often nonsensical, internally inconsistent, or factually incorrect--meaning that the work required to transform an ai-generated plot into a coherent screenplay would be equivalent to drafting an entirely new screenplay. If production companies are permitted to use ai in this manner while still claiming &quot;human authorship&quot;, it is very likely that writers will find themselves forced to accept &quot;adaptation&quot; wages for what is essentially original work, severely undervaluing their labor and threatening many people&#39;s livelihoods.<br/><br/>In a similar manner, the emerging use of ai to imitate human voices or appearances presents a severe potential threat to performers&#39; livelihoods. In most TV and film productions, actors are paid only for the days they appear on set, regardless of the length of the shoot. In the videogame and animation industries, voice actors are paid only for the hours they spend in a recording booth. Under these business practices, any use of ai to reproduce an actor&#39;s voice or appearance without that actor appearing on set represents a direct loss of wages. Whereas previously a recurring extra on a TV series might expect a few weeks&#39; worth of work, production companies are already proposing offering a single day&#39;s wages for actors to have their 3-d image taken--at which point the company would use the actor&#39;s image to fill the same roles, without paying the actor any further. <br/><br/>The potential mis-uses of ai are by no means limited to the film industry--it just happens to be the most visible at present due to this summer&#39;s strikes. Artists and graphic designers face lost wages if companies choose to employ ai image generation over human labor for everything from paperback covers and movie posters to website design. Independent artists and writers who post their work online (often a necessity for effective self-promotion) regularly find that their work has been used without their consent to &quot;train&quot; an ai to produce similar pieces. Authors have found ai-generated books listed online which were trained on their work and sold under their name, and have had no recourse to force those listings to be taken down or demand that damages be paid. And while the proliferation of YouTube videos where ai imitations of popular artists&#39; voices are used to &quot;cover&quot; other artists&#39; songs are generally comedic, they also present troubling implications regarding the potential use of ai within the music recording industry.<br/><br/>Across industries, ai generation represents a significant threat to the livelihoods and intellectual property rights of ordinary Americans. A requirement that works be of &quot;human authorship&quot; in order to be eligible for copyright may discourage SOME of these abuses, but would likely be insufficient to protect against the many ways that companies are already using or threatening to use automated content generation to cut corners and underpay human workers. Much stricter protections are needed.
