I believe AI works, or rather, Mimic Algorithim works, since these Mimic Algorithim works can only reprocess and reformat existing data, often stolen from genuine creative works, it would fall under Derivative Works rather than standard copyright. You should not be able to copyright the output of an algorithim. I cannot copyright 2 + 2 = 4.
