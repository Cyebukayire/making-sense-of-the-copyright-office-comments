My response to AI in almost all forms is negative. I do not want AI to take the place of individuals who create things that make life worth living. AI is just a flimsy attempt to remove real people out of jobs and highlights the disrespect and callousness of studio executives and many others. I would only accept AI in the case of running extensive calculations in an attempt to find a cure for disease or the mutual benefit of society. Never will I accept AI replacing artists of any kind, including musicians or actors, and to ask that of anyone is an insult.
