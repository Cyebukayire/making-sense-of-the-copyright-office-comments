AI art is not art, and real human artists(musicians, writers, typographers, editors, and more) need to be protected from having their work stolen without recognition by those who want to claim their artists but put no human soul or emotion into it. AI is not intelligent. It&#39;s machine learning, and it&#39;s dumb. It does not see the full spectrum of the world and is entirely reliant on the view of the company/developer who made the AI. It takes the human element out of art and steals from real artists in order to do so. Please protect artists, Especially the small ones, from AI art
