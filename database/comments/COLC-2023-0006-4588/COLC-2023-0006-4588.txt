As a person deeply invested in both my visual art and my writing, I am very concerned about the rise of AI image and text generators.  Many companies have stated their intentions to replace workers with AI, which will lead to artists and writers struggling to make a living on their work even more than they often already do.  Most AI also take data from large swaths of the Internet without permission or crediting, meaning that they are stealing the hard work of hundreds of thousands of people and passing it off to others as free content.  Sometimes, the creators of these AI even make a profit off of what gets generated, so they&#39;re earning money from work that they&#39;ve stolen.  I have already seen multiple fellow writers and artists discover that their work has been fed to these datasets without their consent, and if the people creating these AI are allowed to continue unchecked, the extent of this thievery will only get worse.  AI is the latest in a long list of things making it difficult for people to practice their craft and navigate online spaces without getting robbed of their work, and this practice needs to be regulated before it causes any more damage.
