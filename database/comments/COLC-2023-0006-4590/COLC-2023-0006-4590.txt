Artificial intelligence should not be safe from the laws of copyright. The training of neural networks should be policed to ensure that copyrighted works are not being used without consent to train AI models to replicate pieces based on said copyrighted works. Generative AI models such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, Dall-e 2, DreamJourney and more should not be allowed to incorporate material into their neural networks if they lack the proper usage rights or consent. This is an issue that needs to be cracked down on, with these training models being forced to provide information regarding the material that is trained on, and not infringe on usage rights by the creators of limited works.
