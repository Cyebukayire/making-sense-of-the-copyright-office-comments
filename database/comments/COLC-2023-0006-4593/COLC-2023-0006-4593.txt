I think the use of AI as proposed as a replacement or even a tool to human workers such as artists and writers is both infeasible in practice and in theoretics entirely thoughtless and unethical. As an AI is not a brain and just an algorithm fed information made by other people which then spits out an amalgam based on what it &quot;knows&quot;, it feeds on people&#39;s work without their permission. I see companies with AIs often advertise that they&#39;ve been trained on the internet, but the people who created what they were trained on are not privy to or compensated for the co-opting of their work. I also believe the belief as AI develops that it could eventually grow so advanced as to replace writers and artists is  as previously mentioned infeasible&mdash;AI is not capable of coming up with its own things that make sense. It is just an algorithm, it does not understand a story or a character arc or a face or a joke. Any use of AI as a &quot;tool&quot; would only serve as an excuse to further overwork writers who have to completely rework what the AI spits out to be humanly clever, only with less resources because higher ups see the AI as supplementing for other writers, which isn&#39;t true. This belief also shows a staggering misunderstanding of the reasons why art is compelling at all.  Whether you like or abhor something, on a base level, you know it came from somewhere and someone. It contains someone&#39;s the emotions and opinions and biases and unmistakable touch of the person or people who imagined and worked on it. You have someone to idolize if you like it, and someone to critique if you don&#39;t. An AI is no one to praise or blame and what it produces doesn&#39;t feel good to consume, because someone didn&#39;t make it.
