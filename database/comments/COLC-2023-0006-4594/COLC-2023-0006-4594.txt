I do not believe anything created with AI should be allowed to be copyrighted as AI is not a human and does not pull from an original, creative source and instead pulls directly from other peoples works. It is not inspiration because it is not alive and cannot think for itself. It is theft, through and through, because a machine or code by itself without human influence or anything cannot create what it has not been told or shown. <br/><br/>The ramifications from allowing AI driven work to be copyrighted would be felt for centuries as if you did go down that path, I fear fixing it would be a different sort of hell. Please do not allow them to do this.
