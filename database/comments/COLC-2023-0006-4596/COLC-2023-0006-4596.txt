While the use of AI could be beneficial to automate things like manufacturing products, it is beyond reprehensible that it&#39;s being used so prolifically in an attempt to keep the human element out of creativity. AI art is art theft. AI writing is plagiarism (and often blatantly false while presenting as factual). Using scans of actors as background characters in television and film and using AI to replicate the voices of actors and voice actors is not only wage theft, but identity theft as well. The blatant disregard for not only the people being stolen from, but the people who are being misled and misinformed by AI &quot;scientific&quot; papers is a real blow to the dignity and intellect of humans, and continued permitted use of them is to the detriment of all.
