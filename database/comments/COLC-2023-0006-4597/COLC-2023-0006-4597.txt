A work created by an AI would be classified, at best, as an anonymous work under chapter 1 of title 17, which defines that the work would be unable to be attached to any &ldquo;natural person.&rdquo; Alternatively, it may also fit, albeit narrowly, into a the definition of &ldquo;work for hire&rdquo; under Chapter 2 of Title 1; however, this would require consent of the AI to have given its authorship to the individual claiming copyright, and a machine or algorithm cannot consent because it does not truly posses free will. In neither case would the work created by AI be appropriately considered the property of the individual who used that AI to create the work. You could no more copyright the output of an AI than you could copyright the result of a game of chess against a computer, or a game of solitaire. It is not the nature of an AI to create copyrighted works, but simply to compile information and produce outcomes based on user input. Any works by an AI would likely need to be reviewed and revised before use in any case, meaning that the individual or organization attempting to copyright an AI&rsquo;s work would be considered an editor at best. This is not to say that someone could not copy right a work that contains some amount of AI produced work, academics use programs to complete complex statistical algorithms which are published in scientific journals and copyrighted on a regular basis. However, it is not the program generated outcomes that are subject to copy right, but the independent words and ideas of the author, and the inferences and descriptions they afford to the programs outputs. In the same way, any work produced by an AI should require significant investment and input by the individual or organization seeking to copyright, and could not be considered proprietary on its own, without significant change or addition to the outcome.
