Generative AI systems have broken copyright law on a mass scale by being trained on copyrighted materials whose copyright holders did not give permission for such use. If, for example, they had used Disney films to train an image AI, I do not believe we would be having this conversation. There needs to be both legal means to withhold permission to having your art or writing used by AI systems, and consequences to breaching said permissions. At the very least, it is imperative to not allow derivative works produced by AI to be considered copyrightable, lest we open the door to fanfiction and other human-produced derivative works being considered valid for copyright.
