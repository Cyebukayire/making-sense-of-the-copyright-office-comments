Please do not allow AI works to be copyrightable. AI, at this time at least, are trained using stolen artwork and writing. The work they produce is a regurgitation of the hard work of real creators who did not consent to their work&#39;s use in this way and are receiving no compensation. If AI works do become copywrightable, there should be strict requirements on how the AI was trained so that unpaid creators are not having their work stolen. Please protect creatives.
