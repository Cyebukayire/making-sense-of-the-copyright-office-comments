Thank you for asking for and considering the opinion of the public on this important issue. It means a lot to me as a writer whose works are published on an accessible Internet archive and on my personal blog that AI and various generative machine learning programs not have a legal right to use my work without my permission or knowledge. <br/><br/>The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.&nbsp; This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.&nbsp; Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright. <br/><br/>As an individual who is not particularly tech-savvy, my understanding of AI models and their workings is limited to what I hear from more informed persons. This leaves a great deal of room for fear whenever I consider a future where the works I hope one day can be my livelihood are legally allowed to be scraped and fed to an algorithm which may then be tasked to create legally copyrightable knock-offs of my work in minutes or hours. I know several authors who have had this happen to them, and who are currently struggling to get such works taken off of sites like Amazon and Goodreads, or at least to ensure that such works cannot be published under their name. This kind of thing causes serious harm to the livelihoods of authors and artists while producing sub-par work and enriching unethical individuals who use copyrighted materials to train their AI models without notice or compensation to the creator who put many hours of hard work and passion into their art.<br/><br/>Even more concerning to me is the imitation of voices, images, likenesses, and styles. Personally, I find the replication of dead actors to fill roles in major Hollywood films ghoulish, but at a factual level it is a violation of the imitated person&#39;s right to determine what films they do and do not appear in. They&#39;re dead; they can no longer consent for their image to be used. The push by certain film studios for actors filling minor parts to sign over the perpetual right to their likeness strikes me as predatory. AI should not remove the obligation that distributors of art must appropriately compensate the individuals whose labor and likeness went into making that art.<br/><br/>As a member of the public and as a maker of art, I would like to see the Copyright Office institute policies that refuse copyright to primarily Ai-generated intellectual property and require the operators of generative AI programs to 1) adequately compensate the makers of any copyrighted intellectual property that goes into the AI&#39;s learning dataset, 2) disclose the use of AI in the creation of primarily human-created art, and 3) publicly credit the copyright holders of art included in the AI&#39;s dataset.<br/><br/>In a perfect world, there would also be a way to discourage the widespread use of copyrighted materials in the datasets of AI models which do not attempt to produce copyrightable materials, like the various phone apps which will generate an image on command. The years of practice, not to mention the skill and effort and time, that go into the production of any art should not be replaced by machine learning. They certainly should not be replaced by machines which built their programs on stolen art. <br/><br/>Thank you again for soliciting public opinion, and for listening to my opinions in particular.
