To whom it may concern,<br/>I&#39;m a professional artist, and as such I&#39;ve been greatly impacted by the rise of AI in the past year or so. I&#39;d like to say that the Copyright Office&#39;s stance so far has been a rare spot of good news for my industry--for which you have my profound gratitude--and the &#39;human authorship&#39; test seems eminently reasonable to me. I hope you hold to it. On a personal level, it would be the height of ironic cruelty to allow these tech companies who ignored my copyright and helped themselves to my original works without my consent as they trained their algorithms to then turn around and establish their own copyrights on those derivative computer-generated works.<br/>Thank you.
