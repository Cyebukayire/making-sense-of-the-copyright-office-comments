Hello! I think we should stick to AI being something that cannot be copywrited. It&rsquo;s already made explicitly from other people&rsquo;s work, whether that&rsquo;s art or writing, and it&rsquo;s basically just a very fancy copy-and-paste mechanism with more steps. I&rsquo;m also thinking about what would happen in a given hypothetical where two people pull something identical from an AI and each try to claim it as their own. It&rsquo;s not really either of theirs in the end but still. Not a fan of AI and I think copywrite as a protection for artists is important! I don&rsquo;t think changing this will help protect artists.
