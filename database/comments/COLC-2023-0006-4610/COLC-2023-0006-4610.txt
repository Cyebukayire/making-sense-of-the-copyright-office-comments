AI/LLM is being treated as a replacement for human workers who make their living as artists, writers, and even experts in intellectual, knowledge based fields. Instead, faceless corporations use AI to spread dangerous misinformation and replace workers so they can pocket the money of working individuals who created the works that the AI is trained on. We must preserve the livelihoods of millions of hardworking Americans and disincentivize the use of AI for commercial endeavors. In addition, the training for ChatGPT alone consumed 185,000 gallons of water, 61 times the average American&#39;s monthly use. This number is vanishingly small compared to the amount of water consumed by AI when millions of users access the servers it runs on in order to use AI to replace human workers.<br/>I urge the US government to take action against the widespread use of AI which is destructive to our economy, to our culture, to our environment, and ultimately, to America. Copyright is the first step. AI should be treated as ineligible for copyright or else the copyright should go to the people who created the works on which the AI model was trained. We cannot allow AI to replace the human workers who built America.
