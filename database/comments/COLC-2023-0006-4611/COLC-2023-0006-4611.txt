If AI can synthesize text and images that are originally sourced off of text and images that are available online, it stands to reason that the output cannot be copy-written unless ALL of the original content producers consent to said copyright claim and are compensated accordingly to whomever is attempting to copyright something they had a hand in producing. When I write college essays I have to cite my sources, no matter how well I synthesize multiple ideas and theories.
