AI generated works are often trained under already copyrighted works, and/or are trained without consent given by the original copyright holders. And because of this, it can put people out of jobs (example: voice actors whose voices were used to train AI without consent, and were misused), and potentially put people in real danger (foraging guides published on amazon by people who used AI to make them, but the information may be severely incorrect and could land people in hospitals).<br/><br/>Not to mention the ethics of training a vocal machine learning program on the voice of someone who has already passed away... shouldn&#39;t they be allowed to rest?<br/><br/>As another thing, AI chatbots may be trained using online creators&#39; and authors&#39; works to create an unimaginative &quot;experience&quot; talking to a fictional character.<br/><br/>AI (or as I like to call it &quot;machine learning&quot;), is in desperate need of regulation at the moment and I ask you, as someone who wishes to write professionally at some point in the future, to deeply consider the risks of letting AI run rampant in our society.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my thoughts on the matter.
