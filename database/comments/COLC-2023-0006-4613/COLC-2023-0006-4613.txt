I am writing to you with my concerns about generative AI. From what I understand the large language models use data bases made up of information scooped up from public sources like the internet and allow interesting combinations of previously created materials. To me this is a form of plagiarism and if uncredited allows a non creative to use someones else&#39;s work potentially for commercial purposes.  For instance, I could ask the AI to write a screenplay in the style of Quentin Tanrantino and it would use screenplays from that writer/director to make up a mish-mash of stolen ideas that have the surface appearance of original material but are in actuality an algorithmically generated copy of an original artist. This material should not be able to be copyrighted and sold. I can live with AGI making interesting free material for social media but it should not be considered original and copyrightable any more than a college applicant can ask chat GPT to generate an essay for their applications and try and pass it off as their own material.
