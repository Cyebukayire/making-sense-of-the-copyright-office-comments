1. Any and all datasets used in training AI should be acquired ONLY after explicit permission has been given by the creator in response to being asked specifically about the use of their work in training models, as opposed to requiring creators to remove themselves AFTER their work has been used following an automatic opt-in through agreement to a site&#39;s general terms of service like with ArtStation and DeviantArt. Creators who have opted in should also be allowed to opt out at any time and have their works removed from the existing dataset immediately. Creators have a right to control when their work does and does not get used. <br/><br/>2. Works created with AI sourced from datasets containing works that are not original to the AI user or created for the express purpose of use in AI training should not be eligible for copyright. I don&#39;t care how many hours one spends finding the right keywords to generate their desired image, they are requesting that a computer throw together an amalgamation of work created by other people. They likely don&#39;t have a creative bone in their body, and are therefore not artists, not creators, and should not be allowed to claim ownership of something they did not truly create, even with the artist&#39;s opt-in permission. <br/><br/>3. If protocols like explicit opt-in permission/opt-out rescindment of said permission are in place and a creator&#39;s work is used to train a model despite giving no permission or rescinding prior permission to do so, liability should lie primarily on the person or company in charge of training the AI model on that artist&#39;s work. There may be cases where the end user may be at fault for deliberately attempting to mimic or copy a creator&#39;s work in a manner that doesn&#39;t fall under parody, but ultimately the company submitting works to be trained on is responsible for allowing that level of imitation to be achieved.
