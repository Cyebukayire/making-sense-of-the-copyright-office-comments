Artificial Intelligence, while an incredible step forward in technology, is setting a terrifying precedent for artists and writers currently. Studios are laying off artists and writers at alarming rates, and it&#39;s because they think they can replace them with AI. This is unacceptable. In no world should humans be kept from doing the creative things they love, just because a robot theoretically could do it faster and cheaper. There NEEDS to be regulation around AI. It can&#39;t just be allowed to take its &quot;inspiration&quot; from everything online, especially independent artists and writers on small websites. People are losing hope that the arts can be fulfilling for them because of this. Please, do something. We&#39;re all begging you to.
