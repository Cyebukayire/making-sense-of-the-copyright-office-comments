As an artist and as a student of law the issue of artificial intelligence poses a serious concern for copyright. I believe the Copyright Office&#39;s current position --that AI-generated works cannot manifest copyright --is strong and should not be shifted. The entire premise of copyright law is to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts&quot; and to encourage &quot;innovation, advancement, [and] social benefit.&quot; To allow copyright to manifest from AI-generated works would not only go against the plain text of the Copyright Act, but the very foundational notion of intellectual property in the United States. Not only are AI-generated works on shaky ground for the issues of plagiarism and potential infringing action in their development, they endanger the very group that the IP Clause sought to protect. To be an author in our society is to put yourself in a financially tumultuous position, and the means by which most artists continue to survive within their chosen profession is to do gig work --work that can very easily but very poorly be done by AI. While the work is inferior, the price point will simply force many businesses hands. It doesn&#39;t matter if the work is worse, they didn&#39;t have to pay somebody. Copy writers, ghost writers, illustrators, all of whom have contributed to the very data set that is being used to try and replace them, will slowly but surely be edged out by AI. The United States government cannot be a party to this nor should its powers be used to incentivize the destruction of an industry. Copyright is a temporary monopoly granted for the sake of authors, not for the sake of businesses and certainly not for the sake of an artificial intelligence. I am not writing in favor of outlawing AI-generated works, but I am a strong proponent of never extending a government-granted monopoly to works made at the expense of human workers.
