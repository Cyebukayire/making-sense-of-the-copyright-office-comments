The teams involved in the creation of AIs across the globe have broken numerous intellectual property laws by not only supplying the AI with intellectual property for which these teams lack the rights, but also perpetuating the AI&#39;s creation of art informed solely by the stolen intellectual property. In many cases, this could be compared to &quot;tracing&quot; in the art community between humans, in which one artist traces another artist&#39;s work (sometimes with small changes) and then sells it as their own. However, in this case, the AI is tracing millions upon millions of artists&#39; work, making it impossible to track the art back to its original artist. AI can be a useful tool for millions across the globe, but many of the current implementations and executions present a threat to the jobs of artists everywhere - a much needed career to uphold today&#39;s society and each institution contained therein. AI can uphold no intellectual property rights by itself if it produces no new, creative, or independent intellectual property.
