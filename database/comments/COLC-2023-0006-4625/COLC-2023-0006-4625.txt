AI should not be able to scrape copyrighted works, including art and writing. Companies also should not be allowed to scrape artwork that was made by independent artists in order to make something for their company, be it a logo or artwork for TV shows, movies or book covers. That takes jobs away from real artists and hurts their livelihood. The same goes for writing, because AI can only steal what talented writers have already created in order to make something quickly. Artwork and writing should be protected from AI scraping.
