I think it&rsquo;s horrific. The person didn&rsquo;t make that. They used a robot to make it, who ripped and stuck stuff together from actual human beings. This is like the situation with the monkey selfie. They didn&rsquo;t make it, they only used it. What will happen to future artists, and styles? Will the Ai just keep repeating itself where it&rsquo;s running out of content being fed to it? Humans have love ideas and passion, ai has none of that.
