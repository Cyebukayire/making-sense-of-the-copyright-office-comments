AI should never be copyrighted. You should make money or keep exclusive rights to whatever AI creates. Artificial intelligence doesn&rsquo;t need money to live, it doesn&rsquo;t have feelings or family, it doesn&rsquo;t create soul crushing symphonies or write a movie that makes me cry every time. REGULATE AI thoroughly and completely.
