I have seen the chilling effect AI scraping publicly available art and I am worried for a future where it is not reigned in. I have seen a noticeable impact on artists who are having more difficulty supporting themselves because they are competing against AI generated art created by people who have taken their protected works and used them as part of their training set. <br/><br/>I would like to see stronger protections for artists. Two things I would like to see are penalties to people taking works with out permission sufficient to make it not a sustainable business practice, and to require corporations holding copyrighted materials to have artists opt into having there works included in a training set rather than opt out.
