AI art and writing has never been beautiful, and there is no benefit to attempting to make it so with unregulated development. The only people truly interested in replacing artists with programs are those sick of paying an already underpaid group. In good hands, as a professional screenwriter I can see AI as a tool to help, but the heads of studios have clearly shown their intention to use it to replace multiple industries--visual art, VFX, screen actors, voice actors, writers--with a substandard, soulless application that only helps their bottom line. In terms of copyright, without regulation studios have clearly indicated that they are interested in using AI as a way to minimize the credit--and therefore payment--of human writers by having them punch up an AI written outline or first draft, to attribute the copyright to a thing that has no livelihood or family to feed. As the historic double strike currently going shows, this is already a mistreated industry and unregulated AI could threaten it even further.
