We need to be incredibly careful with how much leeway we&#39;re giving to the concept of &quot;AI&quot; -- the scraping of copyrighted material and influx of user-input without user consent is creating a plagiarism machine. A computer program isn&#39;t learning a style and creating its own, it is using material of humans that are not being properly compensated for and then recreating that content in a way that only appears unique. People who work on art, be it writing or other mediums, shouldn&#39;t have their work basically stolen and then regurgitated for consumption by companies that do not want to pay them. None of this data is coming from nowhere. This is being taken from copyrighted and creative works of human beings and that needs to be contextualized and protected. We will lose so much creativity and progress by allowing a machine learning program to modify and/or emulate existing work. Its the only thing that computer programs can do, because they aren&#39;t actually thinking or creating.
