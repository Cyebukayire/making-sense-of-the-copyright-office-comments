Hello,<br/>I am writing this as a concerned citizen/artist/writer, and someone who has spent a significant amount of time in the online art community. I have witnessed on multiple occasions the negative results of AI and how it has harmed people&#39;s livelihoods, whether through stolen images, written works, or even voices. <br/><br/>The main problem with AI databases is the amount of both copyrighted and sensitive material that has been found and used without consent or compensation, and more often than not, without awareness from the person whose work or images have been taken. In the case of one artist, her private medical record photos were used in a popular AI training data set, and even after expressing to LAION&#39;s engineer that she would like them removed, absolutely nothing was done to take them out of the database. Her situation just reflects one of many, where personal and private data has been used and stolen.<br/><br/>Even in cases where AI datasets have adopted an opt-out system for the content used in their training sets, why should the burden be on creators to opt out when there is no easy way of telling what content was stolen to begin with, or how their images have already been used, manipulated, and/or sold without permission? Therefore, I believe what would be most fair is an opt-in system that should be required for all AI models, and by default, only allow works that are in the Public Domain. Those who then allow their works to be utilized by AI can then choose to opt in and contribute their creations, if they are interested in doing so.<br/><br/>With problems like these still being so prominent, it wouldn&#39;t be fair or ethical to allow people to use the work of others to monetize content they had no part in creating. AI has no human author, nor is any creative role taken in making AI works, as it is a product of the AI model, and no conscious decisions were made by the one utilizing the AI. The creator of the work is undeniably the machine itself, as the user of the AI would be unable to answer even the most basic of questions expected of an artist, such as &quot;Why did you choose to include these colors in your art?&quot; or &quot;What was the inspiration behind this piece?&quot; or &quot;What emotions were the driving force behind this creation?&quot;<br/><br/>This issue extends beyond images, but voices as well. Many voice actors have lost out on work due to the rise of AI usage in recent times, and more prominent figures in the voice acting industry have explicitly proclaimed that they have given no consent for their voices to be used in AI, which has been repeatedly ignored by the producers of these AI models. To a voice actor, this is a deadly blow to their careers, as the value of their job is inherently tied to their voice. <br/><br/>I cannot support a world in which someone can choose to monetize anyone&#39;s voice or face without permission and/or create false imagery and audio that can be used to slander people&#39;s names, as Deepfake pornography is already a large problem online that disproportionately affects women. I also find it morally bankrupt that numerous studios in Hollywood oppose paying hard-working writers and actors so much that they would rather replace them entirely with AI (which is one of the leading causes of the on-going strikes).<br/><br/>Independent artists and writers also typically do not have the financial means to defend themselves from these predatory actions, and without protection from the law, the conditions that artists and creators face will inevitably worsen. To allow anyone to take what is often hours upon hours of labor and monetize it, without the original author receiving any benefit, will do irreversible harm to the entertainment industry and has to be stopped. The rights and boundaries of not only human creators need to be protected and respected, but the rights of ordinary citizens as well. No one should have to live in fear that their image, voice, or works can be used by others to produce and profit off of content that they had no say in.<br/>
