AI are a serious issue for copyright. AI is made of copyrighted material that it &#39;learns&#39; from and repeats like a robot mimicking what it&#39;s programmed to mimic. It cannot do anything new that it wasn&#39;t given and these datasets are not transparent and one&#39;s copyrighted material cannot easily be distinguished as being infringed upon by this art and cannot easily be removed. As an example, many of these AI programs will create art of Mickey Mouse if prompted to. This is not because the AI happens to know Mickey Mouse; it is because it has copyrighted Disney material of Mickey Mouse in its system that it can pull from. It does not necessarily need a prompt as specific as Mickey Mouse to commit these copyright infringements, but regardless, this is in their system and many of these AI programs are not free. I uploaded an image of a screenshot of a tiktoker using an AI art program to create Mickey Mouse artwork.<br/><br/>Additionally, allowing AI art to be copyrightable, it incentivizes companies to continue to use AI art, which is again built upon the art of real artists, in order to save money. It is bad for the economy and the ongoing artistic culture of the US.
