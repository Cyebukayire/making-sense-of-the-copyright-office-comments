I don&#39;t think that AI is a tool that should have any place in copyright. Even in the event where someone creates an AI-generated image and alters it in photoshop, the creation of that image relies on stolen material. I work for a company that wants to incorporate AI technology, and we went through a tutorial meeting walking us through the best and most effective ways to use Midjourney. In this tutorial, we were taught how to skirt the rules of the program, like how to upload stock photography to personal online libraries to try to get around their filters. I fully believe that companies will use these tools unethically in the name of quick profit, and it will threaten the copyright that every human artist has over their work, disrupt the creative industry in a way that will lead to job loss, and will simply fill the world with bad art. I think that this tool can only ethically exist in a country that has very strict and enforced laws on their usage. I would personally like to see AI-generated images be required to identify themselves as such as a legal disclaimer.
