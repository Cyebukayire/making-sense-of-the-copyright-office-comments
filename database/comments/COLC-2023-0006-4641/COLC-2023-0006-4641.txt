Generative machine-learning (genML) systems, or so-called generative AI, are often trained with data obtained improperly, unethically, or possibly illegally. In many prominent cases, these training data are collected without regard for any considerations that might militate against their inclusion&mdash;such as the consent of the material&#39;s creators or authors, or whether it is subject to copyright or other protections or restrictions that might preclude its use for such purposes.<br/><br/>Copyright law must quickly be brought up to speed with technological developments that bear so directly on the essential concepts underlying its purpose. Not only should materials produced by genML systems be ineligible for copyright protection, but use of copyrighted works as training data for genML systems without express permission should be unambiguously classified as infringement. Additional regulation is also urgently necessary in regard to genML systems whose output mimics the voices and/or likenesses of real persons, regardless of whether those systems were trained with data properly obtained and subject to no prohibition or protection. Such digital imitation without the informed, explicit consent of the imitated persons must be strictly prohibited.<br/><br/>Moreover, to make any of this practically effective, enforcement of these protections and penalization of violations must be consistent and vigorous.
