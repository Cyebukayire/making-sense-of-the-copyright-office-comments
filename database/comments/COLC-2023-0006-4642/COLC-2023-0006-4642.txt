As a professional writer with ties to tech I have deep concerns about AI. If AI remains unregulated, it could cannabilize all creative careers (and anything related to a creative career) and will lead to unoriginal, lifeless work. There&rsquo;s a saying in the tech industry right now that people should value &ldquo;humanity over humans.&rdquo; Translation - it&rsquo;s more important to preserve the concept of humanity over actual humans. The long term goal is to replace 90% of jobs with AI and the only people still employed will be a managerial class. They think that 90% of unemployed people will be fine for because they the government will introduce a universal basic income. But that&rsquo;s insane! There is no way a UBI gets passed in an American government. Not to mention how much of an absolute mess it would be to say that work generated by an AI can be copyrighted as precedence shows that only things created by humans can be copyrighted. Plus it&rsquo;s unethical and legally dodgy to train AI on copyrighted work without compensation to replace the original author. We are at a fork in the road in our relationship with AI where we will either end up in THE TERMINATOR or WALL-E. I recommend WALL-E
