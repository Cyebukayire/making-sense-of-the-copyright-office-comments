Baseline, what recent AI technology generates is not a unique product. It is a conglomeration of already existing intellectual property; it differs from inspiration by bearing no intent on expanding the scope of all the pieces contained therein, however many there may be. While artists who create original works possess an inherent connection to their product, the pieces used for AI generated products have no means of being credited, and therefore qualify as stolen unless express permission is given in very specific&mdash;and hopefully well monitored&mdash;circumstances. These hollow reproductions violate an artist&rsquo;s right to attribution and inherently violate the very concept of art in their lack of ingenuity. AI engines have been developing at a worryingly rapid rate and need to have restrictions placed on them without delay. In its current vast scope, AI generated artwork does not uphold the concept or intent of copyright, and thus I feel cannot and should not be legally allowed.
