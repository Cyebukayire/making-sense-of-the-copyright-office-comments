I don&#39;t have a lot to say other than copyright exists, in theory, to encourage creativity, and allowing copyright of &quot;AI&quot; generated works will only stifle and harm creativity. The datasets these machine learned systems are trained on is overwhelmingly copywritten material, usually made by individuals, and is then remade my machines owned by companies. The result creates a world where creatives are exploited and discarded for the sake of software and robots who have taken their work without consent, payment, or recognition, and that creates a world where people will not feel compelled to create and innovate, and companies will not feel compelled to hire. <br/><br/>The people advocating for AI think they are asking for a tool, but in reality they are demanding the immediate access of countless copywritten works without the consent of the people and companies who made them, generated randomly without any human input. The people against AI are arguing for their works to be their own, and that is what copyright exists for. <br/><br/>I hope you you rule in the favor of people instead of machines. <br/><br/>Thank you. <br/><br/>
