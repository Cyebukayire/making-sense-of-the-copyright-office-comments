I think the use of AI absolutely breaks copyright in that AI are not coming up with their own words on their own but from taking in written work often without permission from the writers and then basing whatever they answer a prompt with on a collection of works by human writers who worked hard on creating a unique and creative thought. AI inherently has no imagination, no creativity, no originality, no feelings from which to draw to write or create in a way that a human person can...they are instead using what has come before and the output will always have the roots of every piece of writing fed to the AI. Until an AI program can be created that does not need to be taught by the consumption of other works in order to emulate a style of writing, a way of putting a phrase together and other parts of writing, it does infringe copyright. Also, more importantly, AI should not be allowed to create work that is then copyrighted by any person or company because whatever work comes from AI is based on other works and work and creativity and imagination of humans that aren&#39;t given the credit for their part in the formation of the AI work. Such work should be credited to the works that inspired it and more importantly there should be transparency about when something is created using AI be it artwork or works of writing.
