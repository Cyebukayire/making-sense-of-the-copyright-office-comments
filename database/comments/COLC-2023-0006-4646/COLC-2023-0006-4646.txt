As an AI hobbyist, I believe there is a subtle nuance to the relationship between AI training and copyrighted arts. In general purpose models, like Stable Diffusion or ChatGPT, the training data encompasses an enormous breadth of works, copyrighted and not. Using these models, one can generate many styles of artwork, but it is virtually impossible to use such a model on its own to create substantial &quot;knock-off art,&quot; or work that is indiscernable from an artist whose work appears in the training data. However, some models are specialized for the purpose of emulating an artist&#39;s style. In some spaces, these specialized models act like a &quot;plugin&quot; for a general-purpose model. This plugin-parent relationship exists between LoRA models and Stable Diffusion, for example. Most specialized models are not capable of mimicking a particular artist, but some are specialized for that very purpose. It is important to regulate the functional intent of an AI model, as this is the crux of copyright concerns surdounding AI. Regulations of the material used as training data would be counterproductive to the creation of massive data sets used in the training of the more copyright-friendly generalized AI models.
