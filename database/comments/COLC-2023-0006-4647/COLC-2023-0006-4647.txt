I do not believe that AI should be eligible for copyright protection. While what it produces is a derivative work, no human had a hand in creating it, except for those whose art/writing/coding/etc. was taken and used to train the AI. Often, this is without their consent and they receive no royalties or compensation for their work being used. A computer artificially creating something on its own is in no way comparable to someone painting a piece of art derived from a photograph for example, as there is no creative involved, just pure theft.
