Since the age of 15, I&#39;ve read and written fanfiction. Fanfiction are works based on original works such as tv shows, books, and movies that are copyrighted. Fanfiction falls in the grey category, where content added to the fan&#39;s work is owned by the fan whereas the original characters, places, and such aren&#39;t and still are retained by the original author, writer, artist. <br/><br/>The key difference between AI works and fanfic works, where they both pull content from other places, is the human connection. It&#39;s about the value of the human spirit and soul. For free, I have written long, long works. For free, I have written and posted short stories on the internet. For free, I have labored over every word, every piece of dialogue, every description to make the story fit just the way I like it. For free, I do this out of love, uncaring of what audiences may see, feel, and react upon stumbling across my work. <br/><br/>But AI is different. It doesn&#39;t care about the way words are structured together. It only can predict and place the word that is good to be there, as seen in thousands upon thousands of other words. It wouldn&#39;t understand the significance of the soft italicized &quot;oh&quot; moment in a passage between two characters falling in love. To AI, the word &quot;oh&quot; is something that is perhaps nice to insert in this particular place. It doesn&#39;t understand the spark, the realization of love and wonder hitting a character in that particular moment. &quot;oh&quot; is life-shattering, and when used correctly, can make readers feel and live through the character&#39;s eyes. What does &quot;oh&quot; even mean to a machine that has no soul and sees the word in binary? What does it mean to it when it can spew a series longer than the Agatha Christie&#39;s books combined, far faster than what humans can reasonably do? <br/><br/>Copyrighting AI means undermining and diminishing the value of the human spirit. AI is unable to form original thoughts. It can only steal from what exists, and  theft has no right of protection. <br/><br/>
