I do not believe works generated by a machine based upon the work of others should be copyrightable. I feel that this leads to a sort of work around for stealing intellectual property and stylistic details that are important to many brands and production companies, such as Disney and Pixar whose work is industry leading. AI machine learning upon material you own the rights to should be copyrightable as that is derivative of your own work. AI machine learning off of others work without their consent should not be accepted as new works, but instead as derivative as well with the rights being held by the owners of the works used to train the AI.
