As a author, I feel very strongly that AI is violating copyright and that this flaw is foundational to its very existence and cannot be remedied. I have never, ever provided permission to any AI engine or owner(s) thereof to steal my writing for purposes of their own (corporate) profit (looking at you, Elon Musk) and yet I know that this has happened repeatedly because A03 (where I archive my works) has been subject to AI data scraping. Furthermore, as a long time specialist researcher, I feel any product of AI purporting to present factual information is highly suspect and should never be used as a reputable source. Machine learning based programs are not and never have been actual human beings producing actual human being-based works and, as such, AI produced material should not allowed to be copyrighted because its function is rooted in copyright violation and flagrant theft of the work of real people. AI should be strictly regulated by the government and violators of copyright must be held legally accountable.
