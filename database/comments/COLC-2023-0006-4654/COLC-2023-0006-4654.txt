The use of artificial intelligence must be monitored and managed by human ethical and moral principles to maintain a just and educated society. The use of AI holds the potential for great harm if used without prioritizing human needs for an informed and valued community comprised of Americans who have rights defined in the founding documents. We have the right not to have our intellectual properties or personal individual identities stolen and used for the benefits of others without regard to rights to privacy or individual rights to intellectual creative works. The use of images and written content not acknowledging or benefiting private individual human creative origin sources is unethical and warrants reprimand. This is particularly true when AI is used in academic, creative medias, and for public consumer consumption. Plagiarism is in all forms a corruption of intellectual property and is harmful. This harm can extend to communities, individuals, knowledge itself. Harm can encompass financial, dignitary, privacy, and personal domains. The use of AI is by definition artificial and is a barrier to human progress if not used in reasonable and ethically applied ways. Without respectful and reasoned use AI stands to create a more divisive, uninformed, easily manipulated, and unethical society.
