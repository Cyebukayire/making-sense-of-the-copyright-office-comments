Works made using artificial intelligence (AI) often steal the work from human artists by combing through website data for images. Other times, individuals will take works from artists found on the internet to train AI. In both cases, these artists are never made aware that their works are being used to train AI and are unable to protect their works from AI training. Even through the generation of a AI made work is initiated by an individual, the works the AI draws from are more often than not taken without consent. Therefore, these occurrences should be considered copyright infringement.
