Using artificial intelligence to create written or visual art is theft, without any question. Not only is it theft of already created work, it is theft of potential work. If we allow companies to replace living people with AI they will, and this will undoubtedly lead to unemployment for thousands of creative workers. <br/>We, as a country, have many laws in place to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; the American people from migrant workers &lsquo;taking&rsquo; our jobs, but what laws have we to protect us from the very real threat of automation replacing us? <br/>I fear for our future, a future where companies replace their workers with robots to avoid paying them. A future where our government does nothing to stop them and nothing to help us.
