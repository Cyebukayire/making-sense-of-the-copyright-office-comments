I disliked that AI is taking the roles of actual human voice actors and actresses, it&rsquo;s not fair to them at all, they&rsquo;re going to be out of work and jobs and there is literally happening right now and not to mention the whole taking someone&rsquo;s voice with out their consent isn&rsquo;t fair at all like I get why some folks use so for certain projects as they are unable to pay to actual voices but they gave credit they stated they were doing it for fun but either way that&rsquo;s is not fair, I hate that air is being used in websites when you&rsquo;re searching anything and it&rsquo;s is not 100% accurate and there are copyrights it&rsquo;s literally illegal folks that are breaking rules and it&rsquo;s basically not fair to the folks at the strikes as well.
