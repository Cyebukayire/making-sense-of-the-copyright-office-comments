Generative &#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39; programs are nothing more than plagiarism. It is horribly soulless seeing more and more companies and individuals using these plagiarism programs to steal the intellectual property of artists to make a quick buck. Writers and artists of all kind are rightfully furious to have their livelihoods threatened by these programs. Generative &#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39; software is detrimental to society by devaluing the work of artists and saturating the media with increasingly low quality content. And that doesn&#39;t even begin to address the issue of software like Chatgpt being used to generate &#39;information&#39; that is increasingly full of misinformation. Generative AI is a massive issue and it needs proper legislation.
