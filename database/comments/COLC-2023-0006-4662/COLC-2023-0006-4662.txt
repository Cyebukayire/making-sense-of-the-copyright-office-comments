Hello, I am an author and a teacher living in Pennsylvania, and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/><br/>This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little to no recourse. Authors and copy writers are finding their work plagiarized. Adding injury to insult, their markets are then flooded by this plagiarized work. Tech companies have not proposed feasible ways of undoing the damage they have already caused, nor is it in their interests to refrain from causing more so long as it furthers their own goals.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.<br/><br/>Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
