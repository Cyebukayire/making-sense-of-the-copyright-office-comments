When we are in school, we face disciplinary action for using others&rsquo; words as our own. As a teacher, I have disciplined students for doing the same. So why should publishers and film studios be able to take a tool that regurgitates existing content and make money off of it? Not only does this infringe on others&rsquo; intellectual property, it also creates a world where new ideas cease to exist. <br/><br/>We cannot grow intellectually as a society if AI is allowed to become a profitable source of &ldquo;new&rdquo; works of art. No publisher will pay a writer for new and fresh ideas when they can generate a bland copy of a copy of a copy for free with AI. This is precisely what copyright law was designed to prevent. It gives creators the right to own their works and ideas. If those ideas can be reproduced without restrictions and those reproductions can be copyrighted, the entire concept of a copyright becomes meaningless. <br/><br/>A publisher using AI to generate content is no different from a student plagiarizing a term paper. The only thing those two should have in common is that they should not be allowed to benefit from the hard work and intellectual property of other people.
