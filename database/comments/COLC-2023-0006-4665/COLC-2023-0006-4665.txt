The use of AI in content generation is not truly generative. It is plagiarism. AI scans the words of real human beings and regurgitates them out of context, incorrectly reappropriating them like an uncited misquotation in a high school sophomore&#39;s essay. But AI does not have the benefit of human error or ignorance to defend it. These programs are doing exactly what they were designed to do. They are tools of mass plagiarism that unlearned individuals argue to be creation. AI cannot and should not be considered to have its own intellectual property, nor should its &quot;creations&quot; be attributed to the person behind the screen who enters the prompt and presses the button. The use of these programs in the creation of media (visual, print, auditory, etc.) infringes on the intellectual property of the real people whose data has been pulled from the internet and compiled into its library.
