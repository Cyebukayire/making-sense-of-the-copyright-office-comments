Ai is just intellectual property theft at this point.  It has no original ideas and steals from individuals to make a bad amalgamation without crediting or compensating any of it&#39;s source material.  Anything created by AI, that is sourced by anything that has not given explicit permission to be used in this information meat grinder, is just sloppy plagiarism.
