I have seen several image generation services which use the names of working artists (and deceased artists whose works are still under copyright) to advertise the service&#39;s capabilities, or allow the generation of prompts from aforementioned artist&#39;s name. The artists did not consent to their professional reputations, by proxy of their name, to be used in the production and promotion of images which are intended to substantially resemble their own.<br/><br/>I do not think it is feasible or reasonable to place copyright on a style or concept rather than a specific work, and oppose any attempt to advance that possibility. Many artists, by sheer coincidence, will draw from similar inspirations and cultural associations, and I believe accusations of &quot;style plagiarism&quot; would lead to frivolous, unfounded lawsuits and a waste of the courts&#39; time.<br/><br/>However, I believe the use of artists&#39; names in the creation of generated content violates their moral rights in a way that merely naming a genre or medium they worked in would not. Including &quot;Jeff Koons&quot; in an image prompt to generate a metallic sculpture, rather than &quot;metallic sculpture,&quot; implies Koons&#39;s involvement and consent. Similarly, the likenesses of many actors, models, and other notable people can be generated via their name without their consent.<br/><br/>I believe that the use of copyrighted content in training data for generative AI (i.e., AI that generates an image, picture, etc.), without consent of the rightsholder, violates copyright. However, I have seen proposals that whether training data constitutes fair use should be different between generative and non-generative uses. Under such a system, the inclusion of a Stephen King novel as training data for an anti-plagiarism AI which cannot generate text, but only return whether or not a text resembles its training data, could potentially be fair use, while the inclusion of the same novel in a text-generating AI would be violating. I think this dual approach is worth considering.<br/><br/>I think AI can be a powerful tool, but that the current popular uses of it such as Stable Diffusion, Dall-E, and Midjourney rely on fraudulent and unethical extraction of value from human artists. If a program relies on external copyrighted work, the creators of that program should be required to obtain a license, just as if they were using a stock image.
