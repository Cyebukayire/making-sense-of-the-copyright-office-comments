Although it can be argued that AI generated outputs may fall under the preview of fair use, due to its transformative nature. The effect on potential markets are substantial, as ai generated works are often in direct competition with the elements used to train said ai. AI monopolizes markets and deprives copyright holders of income and work opportunities thar would have otherwise been done by real people. People who&#39;s works are often directly used in AI model training, without the copyright holders consent. Furthermore, AI output does not consist of significant human input in the creation of ai output (other than that of those who&#39;s works were used in training) and should be considered ineligible for copyright. For these reason I would suggest that ai generated works fall under violations of the copyright of the original works which were used in training.
