AI producted content should NOT be copyrighted. An AI is not a living being, nor one that has passed. It is simply a system that cannot CREATE, it can only REPLICATE. Human creations are built on years of personalized experience, research, and love for a craft, and therefore should have the right to be copyrighted. AI producted content is merrily mashing others work together and presenting it as solely its own. There was no years of training, there was no rigorous testing, and there was no feelings. AI is merely a tool. If a craftsman creates a table with a hammer, the CRAFTSMAN gets the credit, not the hammer.
