I am Ba Hung from Japan, as a researcher in AI applications in Cloud Computing, I would like to comment on the below questions:<br/><br/>6. What kinds of copyright-protected training materials are used to train AI models, and how are those materials collected and curated?<br/>6.1. How or where do developers of AI models acquire the materials or datasets that their models are trained on? To what extent is training material first collected by third-party entities (such as academic researchers or private companies)?<br/>Comment: For secondary data, we are provided for the datasets or we request them from other entities. Mostly the data will be collected by third-party entities as we use secondary data with high number of records to train AI models. Some secondary data are provided by our system.<br/><br/>6.4. Are some or all training materials retained by developers of AI models after training is complete, and for what purpose(s)? Please describe any relevant storage and retention practices.<br/>Comment: In our research, the training materials are retained entirely for validation and further development of AI models. The retention should be at least 1 year for audit purposes.<br/> <br/>7. To the extent that it informs your views, please briefly describe your personal knowledge of the process by which AI models are trained. The Office is particularly interested in:<br/>7.4. Absent access to the underlying dataset, is it possible to identify whether an AI model was trained on a particular piece of training material?<br/>Comment: Yes, it is. When we have the AI model, the series of random number generator seeds, we can identify which material that AI model was trained on.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Ba Hung
