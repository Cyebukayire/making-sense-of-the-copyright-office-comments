Ai should not be able to use or recreate established artists, writers, film makers, actors, models, photographers, etc. works in any way shape or form. People work hard going to school or training to obtain many of those skills. Some have spent their entire lives practicing their craft since they were toddlers. They have to go through struggles, mistakes, errors, failures before they earn an ounce of recognition, income or success for the efforts of what they create. It&rsquo;s insulting to have bots steal and total strangers make money for content they didn&rsquo;t actually conceive. Content that the original creators had to take hours sometimes years of their lives to accomplish just to have it robbed and discredited. There should be more protection against this theft. And there should be more laws banning the use of ai to create fake human identities to catfish people! If there&rsquo;s a way to do that I think that would be wonderful too.
