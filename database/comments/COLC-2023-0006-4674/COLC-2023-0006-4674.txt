The current &lsquo;AI&rsquo; is not any form of intelligence, and that they are nothing more than a massively large scale automated plagiarism programs, built on an uncontrollable scale. They never provide any new or innovative ideals or services; they just regurgitate data based on the stolen data from countless individuals, many of whom have not consented to provide their information as someone else&rsquo;s work. <br/><br/>Moreover, the data they provide is often incorrect, such as a chat programs refusing to consider that Kenya exists in a list of African country, or hazardous, with Google&rsquo;s primary searches including AI generated answers for poisons risks from common household chemicals. <br/><br/>I believe severe regulation against language driven AIs and their implementation would be the best option available. While copyright laws are necessary, attempting to expand them to include AI regulation would place the burden of proof of wrongdoing entirely on the limited resources of the victims. It is much better to go after the large corporations that are misusing the data of others, directly.<br/>
