As a writer, artist and director, I have struggled to make ends meet most of my life. The pursuit of a voice and style that employers find value in paying in increasing amounts that allow one to make a living is an arduous path in itself. To have the creative product of those years undermined by companies that deem our drive and creative pursuit as grist for the mill is spiritually debilitating. Now we have to compete with a thieving operation that can churn out derivative copies without consent, compensation, or credit. We have earned the protection of our government. We need the protection of that copyright. Given the nature of these companies, they can outspend, outlast and out-maneuver creatives. This is where you can help us protect our very human pursuit of creation, invention, sharing, performing, and entertaining. We make a celebration of the human experience for humans. Please enable us to protect our efforts in the face of people who are prepared to take our voices.
