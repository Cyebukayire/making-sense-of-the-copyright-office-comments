AI is a kind of technology that can be used in many numerous and amazing ways, sadly, many of the ways it&rsquo;s being used today are ways that it can harm people. AI should not be trusted to do any job that a biased human would not be trusted to do. Unbiased AI is a myth and a fantasy. AI learns off of existing examples, existing examples that will have bias present in them. AI should also not be used for the purpose of art. Art is a human expression of the human experience and artists deserve to have their space untainted with falsehoods. It should be illegal to feed an artists work to any AI without that artists explicit permission. Doing otherwise is stealing from that artist and infringing on their copyright. Do no let our free market be controlled by people with robots.
