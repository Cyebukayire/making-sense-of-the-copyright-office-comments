Generative AI frequently is characterized as a sentient being or simulated human, but really, is a product designed and developed by an organization of people. Frequently, such a product is designed to compete in markets from which its dataset is derived (e.g. ChatGPT generated books, Stable Diffusion competing with commissioned work). Under this lens, things become much simpler to understand:<br/><br/>If a creative&#39;s work is involved in the creation of, or is integral to the value of, a product, that creative should be paid with respect to how much they have contributed to that product. If that isn&#39;t possible, then AI generated work should not be able to be copyrighted and sold, in my opinion.
