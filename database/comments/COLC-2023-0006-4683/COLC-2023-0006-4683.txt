I believe that, in support of the WGA, AI copyright should be closely regulated and deemed uncopyrightable. The idea that a machine can spit out books/scripts/artworks/etc and take all the soul out of the making and creating of art is abhorrent. These companies who control AI use it to undercut and scab hardworking Americans out of livelihoods while producing junk. Using AI to create an essay in college is considered plagiarism and cheating. Why is this not also true for bigger industries?
