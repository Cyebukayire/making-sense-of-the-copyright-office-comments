I firmly believe that it is entirely possible for a work made with AI to contain enough deliberate and conscious direction by the person using the program to contain the same merits of authorship as other forms of media covered under copyright. My AI images are often a tightly interwoven amalgamation of my own brushwork, edits, and reworks, and the AI&#39;s generative properties. The AI can be fed a creator&#39;s own images and told to only slightly alter certain lines, or to add shading. Some works can be a collage of multiple elements generated by the user through AI that have been selectively edited together, or a user could pose a scene with photographed maquettes or 3D posing tools and use it as a depth map input to generate a scene exactly as they want it. As for the matter of training, case law and legal precedent is clear, as was established in 1972&#39;s case of Dave Grossman Designs, Inc v Bortin &quot;The law of copyright is clear that only specific expressions of an idea may be copyrighted, that other parties may copy that idea, but that other parties may not copy that specific expression of the idea or portions thereof. For example, Picasso may be entitled to a copyright on his portrait of three women painted in his Cubist motif. Any artist, however, may paint a picture of any subject in the Cubist motif, including a portrait of three women, and not violate Picasso&#39;s copyright so long as the second artist does not substantially copy Picasso&#39;s specific expression of his idea.&quot;. As AI does NOT copy specific expressions of ideas, merely concepts and styles, which do not fall under copyright protection nor should they, AI image training is not a violation of copyright as it is not copying anything that would be protected under copyright. An artist can not own the idea that an apple looks like an apple nor do they own a particular inking style or a certain way eyes are drawn, and these are the only things that image training retains, and only through so many input samples that any individual expression of an idea cannot be recreated without deliberately using an image of that expression as a direct input when guiding the AI and telling it to alter it as little as possible.
