AI has potential to help in technology fields&mdash;coding, other machine learning needs, etc. AI does not, should not, and must not be allowed to in any way infringe on copyrighted material in any way which violates the rights of the creator. This includes using art and writing without permission to &ldquo;train&rdquo; AI. Research needs to be conducted for how to make the technology beneficial to the economy without impacting the job market. Regulations must be put in place to keep employers of all business types from relying entirely on AI for the work of a human being. Please restrict and regulate the open access of software like this so that those who create and use it must agree to terms which expressly forbid the users and the those who create and disperse the software from benefitting financially from their creations in any way (like the Son of Sam law). Technology is not an enemy, but the way people currently are using AI is an abuse of technological advancement. We must apply this kind of technology only in ways that do not take away from human workforce positions and economic products.
