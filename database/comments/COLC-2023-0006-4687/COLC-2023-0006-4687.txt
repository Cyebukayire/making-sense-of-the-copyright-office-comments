At least at this point, I would imagine the quality of AI would simply recycle into a garbage culture.  I&#39;m not entirely opposed to copyright and profit off AI if the resulting work took reasonable effort and resulted in a quality product.  As referring to something like a transcript.  I don&#39;t know why it should be needed though for anything other than crass profit, as though there is not more literature from which potentially quality material could be made.
