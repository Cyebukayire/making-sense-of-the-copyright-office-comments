1. On the use of copyrighted works to train AI models<br/><br/>In order to adequately train a large language model (LLM), developers, researchers and artists need access to incredibly large sets of training data, the licensing or vetting of which is a practical impossibility. By disallowing LLMs to be trained on copyrighted material, regulations such as these would effectively limit this emerging technology to the scant few entities that already hold the rights to incredibly large sets of copyrighted materials and prohibit independent researchers, developers and artists from using LLMs. Additionally, depending on the nature of this prohibition, it may have wide-reaching consequences outside the realm of AI art, as these prohibitions could restrict the ways that human artists could be legally allowed to have their human-generated works influenced by copyrighted materials.<br/><br/>2. On the appropriate levels of transparency and disclosure with respect to the use of copyrighted works<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, the necessary amount of training data for a LLM is incredibly large, and this data is also not stored anywhere accessible by the AI. While full transparency and disclosure with respect to copyrighted works may be desirable, given the scope of this data, it may be a practical impossibility as well to fully disclose the copyright status of the data an LLM is trained on. Regulations in this area may, too, limit the use of this technology to only those entities that have a large amount of resources at their disposal to ensure this data is disclosed and prohibit independent researchers, developers and artists from using LLMs. Additionally, depending on the nature of this prohibition, it may have wide-reaching consequences outside the realm of AI art, as these prohibitions could lead to human artists being legally required to disclose copyrighted works that influenced their human-generated art.<br/><br/>3. On the legal status of AI-generated outputs<br/><br/>Legal precendent in the USA is that works with no human input cannot be copyrighted by humans, as such works lack artistic expression, which is a necessary prerequisite for copyright. This should be maintained in the case of artificial intelligence. A LLM is a tool and thus lacks the ability to output artistic expression in and of itself, and thusly its raw output should not be protected under copyright law.<br/><br/>4. On the appropriate treatment of AI-generated outputs that mimic personal attributes of human artists<br/><br/>Once again, as previously mentioned, a well-trained LLM works from an enormous amount of training data. Also mentioned previously, this training data is not stored anywhere accessible by the AI. As such, a well-trained LLM is practically incapable of reproducing part of its training data as an output and thus retroactively following the output of an LLM to the original training data is also a practical impossibility. In the case of mimicking personal attributes of human artists, i.e. their &quot;style&quot;, such mimicry is not prohibited under US copyright law as it currently stands. As such, prohibiting mimicry of personal attributes of human artists in the case of AI may have wide-reaching consequences outside the realm of AI art, as these prohibitions could prohibit human artists from mimicking those same attributes and, especially if these attributes are as nebulously-defined as the concept of an &quot;art style,&quot; potentially pose great harm to the study of art itself. Lastly, in the case of mimicry of the likenesses of individuals, while the issue of an individuals personal rights and right of publicity are very concerning, copyright is not the appropriate tool to address these issues. Individuals do not and should not hold a copyright over their likenesses, and to grant individuals copyright over their likenesses would be to effectively prohibit art that functions as criticism of individuals or potentially even just photographs of individuals.<br/><br/>In effect, the best policy that could conceivably be implemented with regards to artificial intelligence, at least in the case of AI-generated outputs, is to maintain the current status quo. The regulations that have been currently proposed to restrict these AI-generated works are too potentially destructive to art to be safely implemented at this time.
