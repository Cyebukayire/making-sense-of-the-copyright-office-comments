I&#39;m against the use of AI to learn from existing or generate new written content or artistic content in the entertainment space. Using existing material, either written material such as a script or book or visual material such as drawings or paintings, without the original creators&#39; consent is at the very least highly unethical and dishonest. To then use that learning to generate new works is tantamount to theft of artists&#39; intellectual properties. Please regulate against AI in these spaces. The jobs of creative talents depend on some oversight of AI in this area.
