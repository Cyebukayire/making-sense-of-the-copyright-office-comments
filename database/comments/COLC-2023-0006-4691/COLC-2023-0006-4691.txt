AI is a gross violation of human&#39;s creative freedom in the arts by being &quot;trained&quot; by other artists&#39; art without their consent to create something that was not created by a real human. Copyright should only extend to something where one or more humans put real effort into creating art (writing, acting, painting, drawing, voice acting, movies, tv shows, etc.) without STEALING! Otherwise it is covert plagiarism with more steps! If the AI is created by the studios or a person to specifically aid in making a piece of art to make the process easier and not DO IT FOR THEM or STEAL, then I believe it is okay. You should not be able to copyright something that involves stealing other&#39;s art, voice, likeness, etc.<br/>Say NO to AI replacement. Say YES to AI as an aid to creativity!
