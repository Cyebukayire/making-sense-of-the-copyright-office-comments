AI should NOT be used to steal people&rsquo;s art or voices. It should be used as a tool to help artists and actors, NOT directly replace them. There are many creative minds out there just waiting for a chance to shine, and they won&rsquo;t be able to if AI becomes mainstream. Advancements in AI are inevitable, and the technology behind it can be really useful for artists and creators, but it should be regulated and controlled only by those with the responsibility to use them wisely. AI should be moderated in every industry it&rsquo;s used in, because in the wrong hands, it can cost people their entire careers. I really hope we see some proper regulations with AI usage in the future, and I believe there are ways to be able to implement AI without risking people&rsquo;s jobs or copyright and keep things fair for both creators and companies alike. There should be trust and respect between creators, companies, and the public, not hate and fear, and AI is a major contributor to that. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons why the writers&rsquo; and actors&rsquo; guilds are on strike right now. In the right hands, AI can do some fascinating things, but only if it&rsquo;s used responsibly and not used to steal other people&rsquo;s content, be it art, stories, or voices.
