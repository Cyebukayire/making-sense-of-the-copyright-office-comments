I think it&#39;s highly unethical to use copyrighted works to train AI and I believe the use of AI as an art form should be heavily regulated. AI should not replace human artistry in illustration, writing, or voice work. Normalising these kinds of practices is dangerous to the livelihoods of many artists, journalists, and voice actors. Not only that, but I believe it stifles creativity and can be exploited as a cheap alternative to real art. AI substitutes, like in art, often turn out poorly and don&#39;t reflect good quality. AI should be used as a tool not a substitute or training method from the hard work of real people.
