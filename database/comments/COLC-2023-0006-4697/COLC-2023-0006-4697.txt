I am concerned about free reign of AI technology because it has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse in the event that their work is used to train AI against their wishes or without any permission. I believe that having regulations in place about what it can be used for would help the technology to be used in a more responsible manner.<br/><br/>Commenting from Missouri.
