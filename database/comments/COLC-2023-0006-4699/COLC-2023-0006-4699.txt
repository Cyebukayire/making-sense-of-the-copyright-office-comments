Hello! I am a television and podcast writer who is passionate about my work. I cannot put into words how much I worry about AI making my job obsolete. Not because it will be able to write as well as I can, but because it will be able to write something for free. Human creativity and livelihoods have to be prioritized over cheaper content. This tool can be useful, but smarter people than me need to make sure it is highly restricted so that it remains a tool for content creation, not a creator itself. Thank you for reading, and I hope you&#39;ll think about individuals -- not corporations -- when making these important decisions.
