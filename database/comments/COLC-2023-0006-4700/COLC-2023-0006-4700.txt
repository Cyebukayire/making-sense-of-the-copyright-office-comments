Any AI generated commercial content that makes use of models trained on the works of non-consenting human beings should not be eligible for copyright, full stop. These models should only be legally able to be trained on work that is in the public domain, or work specifically made for such a purpose. The current methodology involved in collecting these datasets is fundamentally a violation of copyright- any models that have used copyrighted work in their training should be reset and retrained on datasets free of such work, as any and all points of data make an indelible effect on the final outputs of these generative models.<br/><br/>I believe it would be best that all existing and operating generative models that have been found to be trained on non-consented copyrighted works to be prohibited from doing so, and that they be required to roll back or be entirely retrained on non-offending datasets or else face legal consequences. There is also a case to be made for seeing class-action lawsuits on the behalf of artists, writers, etc. whose works have been used to train these models for commercial interests.<br/><br/>In any case these fields require much stricter oversight and greater transparency regarding datasets and methodology, as well as greater protections for parties whose work is being abused.
