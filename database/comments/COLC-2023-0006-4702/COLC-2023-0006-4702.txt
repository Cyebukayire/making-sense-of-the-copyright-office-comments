i cannot relate to a robot, and a robot is fundamentally incapable of relating to me. ai is trained to mimic what it sees, which makes any emotion it expresses disingenuous from the getgo. i do not want to see how well a machine can be taught to imitate my emotions. that is not what art is about at its core. whether it be in a museum, in a theater, or my own home television, i want to see art that reflects true, real, candid human experiences, in all of their beauty and ugliness; moreover, i want to express these things for myself in my own art, and the absolute last thing i want is to be squeezed out of my dream career because it was decided for me that my unique perspective on life is not as impressive as the machine that was told to imitate it. it&rsquo;s in the name: artificial. the &ldquo;art&rdquo; it produces at the drop of a coin makes a mockery of the time, effort, and experience that is put into the art of a living, breathing human being. <br/>maybe the corporations want ai to streamline art production in the hopes that it makes all art soulless, causes the public to lose interest in it entirely, and forces creatives to abandon their passions to become workhorses. but if that comes to fruition, i can promise that every single person, including the greedy ceos, will find themselves miserable at the absence of the creative expressions they&rsquo;ve surrounded themselves with for their entire lives, from visual art, to music, to tv, to movies, and everything in between.
