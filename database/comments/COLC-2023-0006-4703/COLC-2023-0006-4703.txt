As a writer, it frightens me that a non-sentient entity can access the work I&#39;ve struggled over, and copy or use it for purposes other than those I intended it for - namely, represent me and my ability to craft something readable, or something filmable. I make a living from words, and if an AI program can take my words and generate content that I might have been able to write and get paid for...it makes it impossible for me to work. There MUST be regulation, otherwise no writer will ever be confident that their words will always be theirs.
