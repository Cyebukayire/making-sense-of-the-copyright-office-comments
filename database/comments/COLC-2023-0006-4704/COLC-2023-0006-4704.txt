Hi! I&#39;m Brox.<br/><br/>I&#39;m commenting as a 3D artist, a content creator, and a lover of the arts. Since the use of AI, I&#39;ve noticed the hard work of other artists and creators have their work uploaded without consent to AI databases.<br/><br/>The problem with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Nightcafe and other AI programs like this is that the data sets containing all of those images are based off of hundreds &amp; thousands of others work. Real human artists work who were not approached or asked, and in some cases experienced people building AI generators specifically to replicate their works. It&#39;s basically robbing us of our hard-earned effort.<br/><br/>As a result, this can be harmful to that artists career and livelihood. I&#39;ve attached an example here that is a screenshot directly off the StableDiffusion reddit page. This bot is directly being fed hundreds of images from one specific artist or even several similar artists to replicate their style of work.<br/><br/>In it&#39;s current status, the use of AI in a creative space is theft. All of the datasets that have been gathered and created off the work of other artists. Whether this is drawing, painting, photography, music, really any creative medium. Understandably, AI can be used to help others find inspiration where it&#39;s needed, but I am wholeheartedly voicing my displeasure and disappointment in seeing such artificial intelligence being used in the malicious manner it is currently being used in.<br/><br/>There needs to be boundaries and rules in place for this to protect people and creatives. Because if we lose the real people who pour their lives into the works they create, what will become of the artistic nature of us humans?<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and I hope you can to see the damages and repercussions this will cause if not addressed.
