Copywriting laws have been clear for as long as they have been in place, but those rights have been completely removed with AI. AI has passed not only the copywrite laws but also medical information. Cases of people&#39;s personal medical information have been found in &#39;AI creations&#39;, which is just as scary if not more disturbing than having your Identity stolen. <br/><br/>AI is quickly removing jobs from hard-working artists in all fields of work. Not just artwork, game design and movie animation but also writers for books, TV and movie scripts, and actors. People who used to have a stable and well-sorted after job are now jobless because AI is &#39;cheaper&#39; and &#39;easier&#39;. <br/>Ai can not provide the same touch in its works as a human can; all it can do is copy and rip off from artists&#39; hard work and remove all the beauty and joy that comes from a piece of work that some human-made. Humans are storytellers. They always have been since the beginning of their time on this earth. From painting on walls to making music and creating the legends that, as kids, we watched, learned and listened to, all of that will be removed from humanity because big companies would instead remove half of the crew needed to make any production and replace it with a few computers to spit out garbage that is ripped off copies from previously made works. Every person loves to tell stories. From embarrassing things from childhood to something one saw from walking around the neighbourhood. Everyone creates art in their way.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>If AI is allowed to continue to grow and produce works, not only are you looking at every artist in the world being jobless, but you&#39;re also looking at every writer, singer, and actor losing their jobs because a computer could do it faster and cheaper. You will hear music on the radio produced by a computer with no human involvement, and any show you watch on Netflix or Hulu will have no actors in it, from the script to the actual footage and music being made by an AI. No one will be safe from AI. It will steal everything that it has access to and copy it only to reproduce it further down the track. There needs to be more protection enforced for people against AI. More rights than just protection against work being copied.
