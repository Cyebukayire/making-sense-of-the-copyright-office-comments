I haven&#39;t (yet) been personally impacted by AI stealing artwork, but I hear all these stories and opinions about it and I&#39;m genuniely worried about what we&#39;re coming to. I think it&#39;s reasonable to expect disclaimers on AI-generated works, no matter if it&#39;s art or scraped data. I think we should expect credit given where it&#39;s due and a release of all copyright protections on tbat AI art (especially because they used someone else&#39;s work to create it). I can maybe see a benefit to AI, but not if it comes at the expense of human artwork and rights. I&#39;m interested to see what comes of this and I hope we can all agree that everyday citizens should have protections against corporations using them for their own greed.
