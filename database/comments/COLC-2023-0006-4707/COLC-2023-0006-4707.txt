I think that AI is not only theft of intellectual property but is also taking jobs from our American people, taxpayers who want to work for a living and are seeing their jobs and livelihoods taken away. None of the AI that exist right now are using fully properly sourced materials, and are &quot;scraping&quot; from other people&#39;s work without their consent. Theft, through and through.
