The outputs generated by language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 should not be considered as derivative works that infringe upon copyright. Drawing an analogy to educational settings, when one utilises a book to impart knowledge to another individual, this is generally accepted as fair use. Similarly, GPT models ingest a vast array of content and then transform it into something entirely new and distinct. This transformative process is a key factor that places the model&#39;s output within the realm of fair use, thus negating claims of copyright infringement.
