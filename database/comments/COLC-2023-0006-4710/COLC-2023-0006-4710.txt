I want begin by thanking the Copyright Office for the opportunity to comment on the matter of AI copyright issues.<br/><br/>I am an artist who has concerns about Copyright against my exclusive right to my works.<br/><br/>Allowing AI to be trained on Copyrighted material without consent (and compensation in the case of purchasing the rights to train an AI off said work) from the Copyright Holder infringes upon an artist&#39;s rights to control their work.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the author of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
