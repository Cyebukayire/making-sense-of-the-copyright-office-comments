AI Art is being used as a profiting tool and sold as actual art when it is in actuality sampling others drawn art without permission.<br/>They are literally profiting off of i other artists without their consent/input and claiming that they did the &ldquo;work&rdquo; even though no actual input was made other than just typing words.<br/>It is an deliberate insult to artists everywhere when AI is being used to surpress artists.<br/>
