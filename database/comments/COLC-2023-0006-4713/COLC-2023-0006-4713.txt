AI, ChatGPT and other models of artificial intelligence rely on data scraping and the intelligence of human being and people to gather their material to create &#39;new&#39; work. So much of that &#39;new&#39; work is a poor amalgamation of material where the true creators have received no compensation. I stand in solidarity with WAG and SAG/AFTRA to ensure that their artistic integrity is maintained and properly compensated. People deserve to be properly paid for their art. I believe AI has a place, but I would much rather it be picking up trash in the ocean than ever be used in the creative process. When we introduce AI into our art, we risk losing its heart, its thoughtfulness, its empathy, its risk, its soul. AI also relies on a lot of resources for upkeep, a lot of water and electricity and I want my money going to an artist, not a machine. Just because we can doesn&#39;t mean we should. You risk cheapening the legacies of artists everywhere because it&#39;s &#39;cheaper&#39;. Monetarily, it might be less expensive, but there will be a great social, cultural and emotional cost.
