I think there should be like an &ldquo;AI disclosure act&rdquo; where if someone uses AI to create anything&mdash; their english essay, a mimic of someone&rsquo;s voice singing a bo burnham song, &ldquo;art&rdquo;, a novel imitating someone else&rsquo;s writing style&mdash; they legally have to disclose it and would face harsh penalties if they didn&rsquo;t.  AI programs should also be obligated to put masks on their content&mdash; digital signifiers that this content was AI generated.  Not necessarily changing it, but leaving in a signifier code that can specifically be detected by other algorithms to determine if something is AI generated.  This can be especially useful for AI writing&mdash; kids can&rsquo;t use AI to cheat because it&rsquo;ll be picked up by the school&rsquo;s anti-cheating software, amazon won&rsquo;t publish fake books under real people&rsquo;s names because there&rsquo;s a digital tag that says it&rsquo;s fake<br/><br/>AI mimicking peoples voices, writing styles, and art should not be allowed to make profit.  This is a mechanism that goes beyond parody, it is deeply intrusive to the individual it is attempting to mimic.  AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; is a facsimile of reality, a shallow imitation of what already exists.  AI cannot make art because it has no experiences to draw from.  <br/><br/>Also, companies like Google should be legally barred from scraping their users&rsquo; data to generate AI content and programs.  It violates a right to privacy and intellectual property.
