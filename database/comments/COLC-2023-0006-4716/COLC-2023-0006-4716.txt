Artificial intelligence as it is does not have the capacity to create works independently, as it relies on an amalgamation from scraping to create its generated output. With such generation, it violates the substantive copyright protections that is allotted to individuals and their works when posted in the public forum, whether a monetary profit was achieved or not. The &quot;transformation&quot; that such artificial intelligence may provide may be minuscule if attempting to replicate a certain style, or overly saturated with &quot;key words, tags, etc.,&quot; that it becomes unrecognizable until further inspection pinpoints specific infringements.<br/><br/>To allow artificial intelligence a wide berth in regulations would cause substantive harm and failings to working populations that create and edit, whether on a micro or macro scale. As seen with multiple artists and writers, such artificial intelligence indiscriminately scrape available works, against the policies and wishes of creators (among the living and the deceased), to return a profit of sorts. With such infringements, creators&#39; works would and could be used to build upon a generated output and see no recourse in payment, no matter the multitude of &quot;searches, tagging, key words, etc.,&quot; that relate to such specific creator(s). With that the financial situation of individual creators and the economy that utilizes creative and/or liberal sectors would be disrupted, altering the livelihoods of many creators. <br/><br/>In addition, the generated output of artificial intelligence does not promote progress that copyright protects, but rather regurgitates a stagnant or regressive product. Without the ability to truly transform or create works of its own, artificial intelligence would only flood the marketplace of ideas and creative works with mediocre replicas, akin to the like of spam, if left unregulated. With even more detriment to progress, the outputs of artificial intelligence can produce falsified information/products that can cause harm to the uncritical eye, resulting in the devolution of social, political, intellectual, and cultural environments.<br/><br/>Overall, the artificial intelligence of today must be regulated as its functions does not replicate intelligence but rather generation.
