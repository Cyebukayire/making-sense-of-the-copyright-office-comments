Thank you for soliciting citizen feedback on such an important issue. I am a writer and editor by trade, and while the advent of AI I do not believe threatens my job, I believe the way other people are treating AI will. An AI can write a scene &#39;in the style of&#39;, but it cannot write a whole story, novel, or script. And it can only do &#39;in the style of.&#39; It cannot write a story in the style of Blade Runner, The Matrix, or Mad Men in a world where those don&#39;t already exist. If AI is allowed to flourish, then my job does not become the creation of wholesale new worlds and stories, but rather trying to piecework together an AI creation. 80% of my job is already editing and revision, the true joy is in the creation. AI would take away the best part of my job and replace it only with the drudgery parts of it. And don&#39;t get me wrong, I accept the need of revision and editing. As tedious as they are, the task becomes worthwhile when I&#39;m able to complete the other 20%, the part that some would see offloaded to an AI. <br/><br/>Art is important. It is how we preserve and transmit our culture, our values, and teach our children how to be a person. It is how we explore what the future may hold, and how to meet those challenges. It is how we can imagine ourselves as the hero or heroine of a story. AI does not and cannot understand that, not at the level at which it currently exists. Art must remain in human hands, controlled and copyrighted by humans. You already understand this, because in order to submit this comment I must verify that I&#39;m not a robot. Human voices matter. <br/><br/>I add my voice to the many creative workers urging this office to preserve the focus and purpose of art, and to protect those who create it. Nothing created by AI should be protected by copyright. If AI was involved at any point in the process, the work must be as transformative as current copyright demands.
