As a artist myself putting up any of my works online, be it drawings, paintings or the rare writings I do I can&#39;t trust that they won&#39;t be stolen to be used in a ai generator. My characters that I have poured hours, days, years into making, writing, breathing life into in any form I can could be stolen from me without noticed cause a ai date scrap my works. I start loosing out on a potential customers that could one day commission me once to many times from me cause they don&#39;t see my works under me, they see a shell of my creations put out there by a ai used for who knows what. I and many like me lose our jobs for inferior works cause we&#39;re real and want to be payed for what we make but ai is being use to kill us off cause its free and many companies, and even some individuals, can cut cost that way by using ai. Giving customs/consumers inferior works to replace the blood, sweat, tears, joy and many other things that goes into making art, writing stories, singing, acting, ect..<br/>I&#39;m lucky enough that art isn&#39;t my currant main job. That these loses cause by ai won&#39;t kill me off from a lost of main source of income like it has so many others I have seen it happen to or even know personally. AI art, song covers and writings is made up of stolen works and voices from real people. It is theft and/or a copyright infringement.<br/>AI trammels all over lively hoods and the passions of many that pour their time into all art forms that being over taken by ai.<br/>I&#39;ve been told for years a robot will one day replace everything I do, but yet they haven&#39;t yet. At lest til now, cause its always been cheaper to keep a human instead of a bot. But now it seems the bot is cheaper as it steals from peoples hard work and passions, both living and dead.<br/>
