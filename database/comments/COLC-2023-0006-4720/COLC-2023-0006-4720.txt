A.I. creations, in their current form, are simply an amalgamation of the works of others, be they drawn images, written words, or taken photos, and most every tool as it stands runs nigh entirely off of dubiously source and often stolen imagery.  To allow the blatant theft of human work to mass-produce cheap products is an insult to humanity as a whole, and should not be allowed in this country.  Using A.I. to make a new work out of someone else&#39;s hard efforts is nothing like inspiration or transformative interpretation; I&#39;d argue that, in terms of effort made, it&#39;s more akin to tracing another&#39;s work and claiming it as one&#39;s own.  To allow the monetization of A.I. works, those whose works were used to create that A.I. generated images must be compensated and accredited properly, or be subject to appropriate consequences of the law for intellectual and creative property theft.
