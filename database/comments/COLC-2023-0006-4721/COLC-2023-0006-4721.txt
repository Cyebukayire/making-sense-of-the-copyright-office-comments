AI-Generated works should *not* be copyright protected. They are created using the amalgamated data of countless creators online with little to no recognition or compensation. Because the data that AI-algorithms depend on is actual, physical hard data taken from the scraped images, it cannot be argued to be the same as an artist &quot;taking reference&quot; from another piece of art for their own work. In the latter case, the artist does not truly replicate the data they take reference from, they still only make their own interpretation. In the prior case, the AI works on the actual, tangible data of the images that have been scraped online, meaning their work is being stolen, and used as an asset without their permission, compensation, or even recognition. <br/><br/>Secondly, AI-art cannot be copyrighted because nobody truly *created* it. They are created through algorithms with little to no input or effort from the one who prompts them. The same would be to commission a piece of art and claim it as your own creation with no credit to the original creator. In such case, breach of copyright. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I am strongly against the notion that AI Art should be copyright protected. Before such should even be considered, I think there would need to be heavy regulations and legal consideration for what is still a brand new technology.
