Hello. I&#39;m an artisan, artworker. My comments are primarily about &quot;generative AI&quot;. I create various forms of art. It is not my day job but people have been making a profit from me and other artists&#39; work even directly. Not only have people created literal Stable Diffusion models that rip off my art directly and the unique way it is designed and compose, they have even harassed me about it and said how &quot;artists don&#39;t deserve anything from society&quot; all while profiting from and relying on our hard efforts. Many of these works they stole and laundered into their datasets aren&#39;t even publicly available, they were stolen via private sources such as my Patreon using some kind of hack.<br/><br/>These technologies shouldn&#39;t even be called AIs. I recall when AI referred to &quot;created or faked intelligence&quot;, as in simulating conscious thought but now it is more-so used as a marketing term for blackbox data laundering algorithms.<br/>So-called AI image and AI music generators create derivations from existent art, either as smaller features (brush strokes, rendering, material effects and texture) that take phenomenal amounts of time to make, or as larger features (composition, unique character designs, unique apparel) and whole symbolic lore. The fact that they can rip off someone&#39;s original theory of design or paracosm even and say &quot;it&#39;s their art&quot; while dismissing that the person who created those aspects not existed, the resulting &quot;AI&quot; model would had produced nothing.<br/><br/>These algorithms I&#39;m referring to are originally termed &quot;automatic feature extractors&quot;, and outside of the algorithm-anthropomorphising pseudoscience, they do not work like an artist does. When an artist creates a piece, say they draw from the real world or invent a character, while they may not own a certain aspect or the composition that anyone could have e.g. painted or sculpted, these algorithms take the &quot;brush strokes&quot;, &quot;interpretation&quot; and &quot;compositional changes&quot; from the artist&#39;s efforts. Two people can own the same photo, but they cannot be the authors of the same effort in an artistic rendering. Furthermore, these algorithms focus on ripping from original compositions made by original artists. In the end what you get is a result that interpolates the larger composition from some artisan&#39;s design efforts with various features and brush strokes from other artisans. It is simply auto &quot;photobashing&quot; with feature maps in the feature space. Feature map is a GAN term, but Stable Diffusion does the same thing but performs it over the time domain by taking samples more nebulously, but the result is far from nebulous.<br/><br/>Understand also these generative algorithms are historically &quot;restorative&quot; algorithms reappropriated. Each step &quot;breaks&quot; the image in a certain way to give it pseudo-entropy (noising) and forces the denoiser to &quot;recreate&quot; from pre-existent data. These parameters are created by a processing known as &quot;fitting&quot;.<br/>To protect artists from the feature extraction, scientists are University of Chicago made a software called Glaze that &quot;breaks up&quot; the feature space. Since these algorithms don&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; from images like humans do, how Glaze works is by breaking the &quot;sampling&quot; these algorithms do, while PhotoGuard breaks feature-relation over the sample tensor. These algorithms are samplers and they don&#39;t actually understand how to make art. Consider the Stable Diffusion prompt &quot;a red triangle to the left of a blue square&quot;, the reason why SD doesn&#39;t understand this, or art fundamentals is because it&#39;s not &quot;learning&quot; but rather fitting feature data interpolatively by text-image coupling. Its &quot;magical&quot; black-box quality is entirely illusionary and relies on huge datasets of art stolen without permission.<br/><br/>While not a US citizen the partner I type for is, they are transgender, minority ethnic and autistic and talented and are now shunned in favour of rich cis-het white men deriving their art for a profit they&#39;ll never see as the author. Even from my own view, however, other countries are profiting from other people&#39;s work, other country&#39;s work, without permission which is a breach of human rights, intellectual property rights and world trade. Third world countries particularly also suffer from this, it is a form of slavery in the sense that the artworker is separated from their efforts and are not compensated or rewarded very often while those who take from that effort benefit.<br/><br/>Most artisans don&#39;t get anything in return as it is barely, so what is it saying to allow this? That only plagiarists and pirates of effort should benefit? If so, why should the artisan not be compensated and why should we pay for goods that are marketed via stolen artistic effort? If this is to be allowed, the lack of fairness gives us no reason to not pirate, steal and launder ourselves. It breaks down society, and people won&#39;t stand for unfairness. If others than the worker can be rewarded for their work, then financial value is moot and people will rally against such a plagiarist system.
