Hello! I&#39;m a writer and freelance artist; unregulated AI is a tremendous concern to me because of how it threatens copyright, livelihoods, and how dangerous it is when abused. I have already seen the damage being done: dead artists being mimicked, voice actors&#39; voices being twisted to things they have never said, REAL people having porn AI generated of them without their consent, plus so many other examples. The Pope has already been shown off in clothing he wasn&#39;t wearing and people thought it was real, how long until people start fabricating evidence, if they haven&#39;t started to already? But there&#39;s little that can be done when someone&#39;s likeness, voice, art, writing, etc is stolen. At best, the people stealing such things get a slap on the wrist as they promise that next time, they&#39;ll &quot;ask permission.&quot; And of course, they don&#39;t, because there aren&#39;t proper regulations in place to stop them. But regulations, strict ones at that, could prevent all of this. I think it is safe to say, there is not a single person who may read this comment, who would like to wake up one day to find that their likeness or something they created was stolen by unregulated AI, and now all your friends and family are mad over words you didn&#39;t say, photos that were never taken, or art you never actually created. At the very least; imagine seeing AI art that resembles your own, but the thief is getting the credit and has no interest in crediting you, acting as if the idea spawned from their own imagination and the AI just helped them. AI could be a useful tool, as seen with how it was utilized to help the Animators for &quot;Across the Spiderverse&quot;, but it NEEDS to be strictly regulated to prevent further abuse, to protect individual&#39;s copyright and likeness, and to allow proper recourse whenever someone is foolish enough to abuse it.
