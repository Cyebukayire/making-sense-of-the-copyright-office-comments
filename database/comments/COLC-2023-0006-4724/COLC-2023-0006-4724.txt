AI has already begun to damage artist lives disregarding the debate on whether it&#39;s ok to use or not. People are losing jobs, and the code has been given seats at the tables of studios like Netflix. There needs to be a prioritization on actual living people rather than algorithms that are disguised as &quot;learning just like people do&quot;, no matter how incredible they may be or how appealing the price to hire inanimate programs is. The objective truth is that even if they did learn like people do, it takes away livelihoods and gives them to people who did not spend money or time learning how to draw. Plagiarism is something that is taken seriously in both the art world and academic, AI art should not be an exception. Just because it is harder to tell what artists it took from? That makes no sense, it still took advantage of their work and would not exist without the effort and minds of real people.
