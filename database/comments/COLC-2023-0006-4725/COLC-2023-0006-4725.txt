Public access to AI tools is not inherently wrong to partake in. It is a tool of observation of media and information compiled into a command based generation.<br/><br/>The ideal use of this would be similar to a search tool, to find something that suites a person&#39;s needs in terms of information or artistic reference.<br/><br/>AI can be used to assist many people and serve as a tool to inspire and enrich those that are lacking guidance if used properly. <br/><br/>However, there should not be a precedent being set to encourage those to use AI as a form of production.<br/><br/>AI&#39;s basis of creation is theft, and there are a multitude of artists and writers that are being stolen from today with AI tools taking advantage of their nativity. So many scams where a company offers you a job, asks for your portfolio, steals your art and adds it to their AI and turns you down.<br/><br/>If you allow copyright ownership of AI generated materiel, you are taking away the rights of an artist.<br/><br/>Artists already have a hard time preventing outright theft of their art being reposted without permission, the average person does not feel entitled to ask permission to steal art from an individual, some people even argue that it is their right to own your designs based on how &quot;ridiculously&quot; you charge.<br/><br/>Copyright ownership of AI generation is against the very acronym &quot;IP&quot; stands for. Since a humans Intelligence is not being used to create something, I can no longer be considered a person&#39;s &quot;intelectual property.&quot; If the intelectual in question did not create the image, paper, animation, audio, or even a number sequence. The hands that guide the hands are not the hands that created, and therefore they are only the creators creator, not the creator of the creation of the creator.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a simple concept many who are unwilling to put time and effort into a skill cannot and will not understand. It&#39;&#39;s why I&#39;m hoping individual concerns will be taken into consideration as opposed to the financial benefits that can be gained by a company that already pays a poor excuse of a salary to their staff.<br/><br/>Please, from the bottom of my heart I beg of you, do not allow creation that is not made by human hands to have a basis I generating revenue for those who do not wish to use the human Intelligence we are so lucky to still have.<br/><br/>A copyright law that prevents people from patenting an exchangable possession created by an AI would be in capitalism&#39;s best interest.<br/><br/>Writers, scholars, teachers, artists, animators, teachers, etc, should not need to fear that the slightest ounce of corporate greed can be easily satiated through the malpractical ownership of AI produced content.
