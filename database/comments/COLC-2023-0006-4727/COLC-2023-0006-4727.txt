As someone who is an enthusiast of both technology and art, I&#39;m deeply alarmed at the irresponsible way in which firms developing AI products do so by exploiting the works of artists. Taking the works of artists and writers without consent or compensation and using them to develop generative algorithms is unethically profiting off of their work, and a fair copyright law would ensure that generative algorithms are required to properly license all images in their dataset.<br/><br/>Further, I support the current position of the law and the US Copyright Office that works generated by AI are not protected by copyright. Even if generative algorithms were generated from datasets with fully licensed works, art must be the result of human effort and labor, and thus a random or pseudo-randomly generated noise pattern cannot be &quot;copyrightable.&quot; Works that take an image generated by an AI and then edit or manipulate them to some artistic effect, however, are different, in my opinion. A metaphor would be: when spilling a bag of flour on the ground, the subsequent pattern on the floor wouldn&#39;t be inherently copyright protected. But, if a person then took a photograph of the flour on the floor, or drew some image in the flour using the random pattern as inspiration, that might be protected under copyright as tangible expression.
