The use of AI algorithms to create art or writing is tantamount to plagarism. These algorithms scan images and texts to &quot;learn&quot; how to recreate it. However, these algorithms are just that: algorithms. They do not learn, they are not inspired by the matetial they see, they can only copy. They accumulate a data base of stolen material and mix it up to create an output. Scanning a piece of media with an AI without the creator&#39;s permission should be considered plagarism and punished accordingly.<br/><br/>In addition, consider this: do we want to live in a world where creatives are replaced by AI? Where becoming an author or an artist is impossible because it&#39;s cheaper to use an AI? If AI becomes the industry standard, the entire field of creatives will lose their work. Art is one of humanity&#39;s oldest and most sacred traditions. Don&#39;t let it be destroyed by the greed of media corporations.
