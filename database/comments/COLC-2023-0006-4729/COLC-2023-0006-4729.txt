To the US copyrights office,<br/><br/>No doubt, you will hear from many artists, creators and just as well corporations who seek to replace them with machines. I would like to offer perspective from a more neutral third party. I am a graduate student doing research in deep learning intelligence. <br/><br/>I would like to raise three points against the copyrighting of all deep learning neural networks and not just &lsquo;generative AI.&rsquo;<br/><br/>Hypothetical benefits of a copyright AI model: I would like to raise the case study of LLaMA. Back in February, Meta developed a generative language model, much like &lsquo;ChatGPT&rsquo; named LLaMA for approved research groups. In summary: against Meta&rsquo;s interest the model was leaked online. Immediately, researchers and hobbyists globally began to experiment with the model, developing it, further tuning it, making applications of it. There are now hundreds of new research papers, inventions, and findings made possible entirely because of the leak of LLaMA. Open-source generative models became almost 4 times as efficient, and dozens of entirely new startups were founded based on these new technologies. The open-source research community even built upon the original LLaMA model and improved upon it, achieving better performance on all benchmarks. All while this was happening, Meta&rsquo;s legal team were busy filing DMCA takedown requests. When LLaMA 2 was released, Meta made it publicly available this time. <br/><br/>The use case of copyrighting AI models is to protect the interests of mega corporations who seek to monopolize the technology. It does not protect researchers. It does not protect artists. It does not protect the consumers. When these models are made available to the public without restrictions, quite literally everyone benefits, even the corporation. <br/><br/>Assignability and what constitutes &lsquo;authorship:&rsquo; I would like to use the following analogy. Let&rsquo;s say you are a farmer. You produce eggs, milk, flour, etc. One day, I break into your house, and bake a cake out of your ingredients. Just because I baked it using my own recipe, that does not mean I own the cake. That cake could not exist without the ingredients you produced, and I have used those ingredients without your consent. Maybe if I paid you and asked you if I could use your eggs to bake cake and give you some of the proceeds I get from selling said cake, that would be ethical, but that is not what is happening with generative AI. Every other research industry the deals with personal data in clinical settings take consent with the uttermost degree of respect even when it maybe overkill, but in the generative AI landscape, we see frankly an unprofessional degree of negligence and indifference towards consent. <br/><br/>Enforceability: How do you plan on enforcing a copyright on a model? Say a model is leaked online much like LLaMA. I take the original model, alter the architecture, and train it slightly on my own dataset. The model is now essentially unrecognizable from the original. There would be almost no way of proving that the model is &lsquo;stolen.&rsquo; <br/><br/>
