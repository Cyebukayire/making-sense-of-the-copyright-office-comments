Either AI is transformative, and as such must receive permission from the copyright holders of the works being transformed as is the case for all other art (I can&#39;t sample a song in my own without paying royalties, why would it be different if I sampled a million songs instead?) or AI is just a fancy autopiloting autocomplete and it deserves as much copyright protection as Siri does for paraphrasing Google search results when I ask it how to fix my oven&#39;s clock, which is to say none at all.<br/><br/>Paraphrasing my thoughts, if AI art can be copyrighted then it must not commit copyright infringement in its training data. That, or the generations of AI must be in the public domain. I do not see any reasonable option other than these.
