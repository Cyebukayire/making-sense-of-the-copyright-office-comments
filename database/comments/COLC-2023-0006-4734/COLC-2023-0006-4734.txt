Artificial intelligence seems to only be used to scrape creations and steal. If AI is used by the government there has to be regulations where the information comes from and prevent it from being used to target and identify private individuals for any reason. There is already enough tech used by the government which I do not trust the people or the tech or lobbyists to not use AI to their advantage. AI should not be used on people but only to automate basic tasks like dispersing traffic congestion by manipulating traffic lights or shunting power from one part of the city to another in emergencies. I oppose the use of AI for identification purposes. I oppose AI to be used to identify people, cars, houses, etc. The government police is being unleashed on the private citizen as if they were military with attack robot dogs, drones, sound machines, etc, for what? For what reason is AI being used to hunt and hurt people instead of HELPING the private citizen. Recent news story of NYPD using drones to police backyard parties. I&#39;m sure AI will gleefully be used by NYPD to further turn their precinct into a military zone. For what? For who??? Enough. Do not use AI on the private citizen.  Do not use it even if the companies shit themselves silly with promises they are helping, they will bite your hands and us and use it against the private citizen. I&#39;m not a conspiracy nut but this pushes the boundaries. The government (senators and representatives and governors, and police departments) must stop deep-throating the rich that shoot money and do something helpful for the private citizen and reign in the terrifying use of technology and AI. You all have ENOUGH money meanwhile we are scraping by to buy shoes and the bare minimum. None of the senators or reps in congress would survive as a private citizen. Do not use AI, it will further ruin our freedom and lives.
