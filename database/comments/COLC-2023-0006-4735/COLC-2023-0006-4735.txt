Apologies if this turns out to be less than useful, but here are my layman&#39;s thoughts on the questions up for discussion. If this isn&#39;t useful, discard it!<br/><br/>Answer to Question #1:<br/>Frankly, I see the impacts (positive and negative) coming in two tracks - in expert hands it will be a potent force multiplier that allows small cadres to accomplish their work with exceptional speed relative to the size of the staff (ie: an animation studio who hands the most tedious and least creative work off to a server stack rather than to overseas contractors) , while in amateur hands it will allow for those who may be talented in one area yet lacking in another to make up for their deficiencies (ie: a musician who seeks to make a music video, yet lacks skill in the visual arts and lacks funds to hire one who is, making use of generated imagery).<br/>If handled poorly, this could lead to job loss as larger businesses slash budgets yet maintaining output, while smaller projects proceed without needing to hire freelancers who would otherwise have been involved. But, handled well, it could also have a massive positive impact on the ability of artists to accomplish great things within their limited budgets - and allow for more lower-budget projects to exist. I do not know which is more likely.<br/><br/>Answer to Question #5:<br/>Absolutely. Rather than trying to force new circumstances to fit old laws, build new ones. Otherwise we will wind up with a mess of loopholes and contrived precedents rather than a comprehensible legal system.<br/><br/>Answer to Question #11:<br/>The practical issue is that contemporary AI models are (if you&#39;ll forgive a bit of anthropomorphism) ravenous for data - they require obscene quantities of information to reach a useful level of &quot;skill&quot;, and that means the developers of such AI models are heavily incentivized to acquire as much data as they can and feed it directly into their systems. Which certainly isn&#39;t helped by the fact that many of the highest-profile developers in the AI space either own, or are deeply connected to those who own, social media platforms and search engines. Setting up a licensing regime NOW? Expect heavy resistance, for they would see it as an attempt to cripple their business model. It would have been best to act on this years ago, but I cannot fault you for not being prophets - you are lawyers and bureaucrats, not soothsayers.<br/><br/>It may need to be done, but it will cause a great deal of collateral damage to these businesses. Do it regardless, for it is your duty to follow the law regardless of where it may lead. They will scream, they will lobby, they will set the media ablaze with their howling. If it must be done, then do it.<br/><br/>Answer to Question #20:<br/>I will be blunt with you: the greatest and most desirable impacts of AI models will not come from copyrightable works. It will be in the automation of many tasks in part, and some tasks in whole. I do not think protection for AI-generated material would be required for the further development of AI systems - because there are so many other fields in which AI systems will have an impact. You need not fear this, the developers of such systems will have many other income streams.<br/><br/>They&#39;ll probably complain about it, regardless.<br/><br/>Answer to Question #32:<br/>No! That would be a profoundly silly law - you may as well prevent artists from emulating each other&#39;s styles.<br/><br/>Those were the questions I found most interesting, thank you for taking the time to read (or immediately discard, perhaps) this mere undergraduate&#39;s thoughts on a field he has no real stake in.<br/><br/>-John Kelly
