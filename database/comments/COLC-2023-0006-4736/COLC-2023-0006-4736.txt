I believe that, due to the nature of how artificial intelligence programs &quot;learn&quot; what art to generate, that AI generating art programs to be fundamentally a breach of copyright laws. These programs scrape the Internet in its entirety to &quot;learn&quot; what things are supposed to look like, and then generates images based on those they scanned, which in the case of artistic pursuits, results in attempted replication and regurgitation of that art, without the owner of said art&#39;s input, and is often used for making money on someone else&#39;s labor. I believe it is a very simple case of copyright infringement.
