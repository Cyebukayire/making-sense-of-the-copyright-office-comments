Copyright was developed to protect the intellectual property of human beings who create things. By necessity this excludes the products of the algorithms that govern the function of so called &quot;AI&quot;, which cannot function as a human brain can and is limited in its creativity by the instructions to which its programming must adhere. Humans create art that uplifts, informs, galvanizes, shocks, and moves us, and which must therefore be protected from theft. AI creates derivative noise that benefits no one and needs no such protection.
