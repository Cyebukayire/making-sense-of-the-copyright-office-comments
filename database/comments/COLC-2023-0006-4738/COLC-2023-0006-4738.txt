I am writing because I am terrified of AI. Not in the sense of a robot uprising or any sci-fi nonsense like that, but in a much more mundane way. It eliminates the need for creativity, and in doing so, cuts out the need for creative people. More and more, people are finding that articles meant to convey information- sometimes important instructions, have been written by AI, and filled with the kinds of mistakes AI will make, that people wouldn&#39;t. People are uploading novels to Amazons written by AI in the style of specific authors, and those authors whose style was stolen can do nothing to take them down, because there is no way for them to stop people from feeding their stories to AI. It&#39;s dangerous to the concept of ownership, and dangerous to the profession of writer. In a world where people&#39;s communication skills are on average getting weaker, making use of a tool to side-step the need for any creativity, simply stealing and recycling someone else&#39;s creativity without permission, will only make the situation worse.
