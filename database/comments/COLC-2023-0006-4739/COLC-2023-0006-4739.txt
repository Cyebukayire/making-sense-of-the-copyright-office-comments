AI based content is a danger to art, privacy, and public safety by posing a very real threat of fabricating misinformation. AI generated sounds, video and images cannot exist without stealing uncredited work from dozens of sources. Human-created art, photography and likenesses are being manipulated and repackaged by a software as something new, but the work is not transformative if there&#39;s no real creative human element at play or an imaginative spin. AI can&#39;t imagine or transform these pieces of data, it can only combine pixels together or put filters on someone else&#39;s creation without their consent. It&#39;s a threat to the livelihood of any and all workers in creative fields by compiling their stolen works with no compensation or credit. AI is also harmful for taking likenesses of people&#39;s faces and voices to create realistic new video of them without their consent that could be packaged and sold without their involvement or used to create damaging misinformation to be used against people. If this technology is not heavily regulated before it develops further, then we risk living in a society where video and audio evidence of any person could be faked so realistically that it would all become worthless in situations where it&#39;s needed most. People&#39;s reputations, jobs and lives could be massively negatively impacted by this technology. It&#39;s dangerous on a fundamental level and needs to be regulated out of circulation before it causes irreparable damage.
