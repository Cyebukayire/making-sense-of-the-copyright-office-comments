Hello I&rsquo;m here to voice my concern about unregulated AI and its threats to copyrights and livelihood.  With the rise of AI it&rsquo;s been blatantly obvious that there&rsquo;s an extreme lack of regulation.  The constitutional justification is to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts.&quot; yet AI is doing the opposite.  AI is rapidly imputing data only to regurgitate a knockoff of what it&rsquo;s learned from.  How are authors supposed to feel safe and publish when there&rsquo;s the looming risk of AI scraping data from their works?  What a slap in the face is it to  have your work regurgitated by AI in the exact same style and prose only to be told you have no claim over your own body of work.  How insane is if that AI can &ldquo;expand&rdquo; upon starry night a painting that&rsquo;s a beautiful depiction of mental health and a view from Van Goghs asylum.  Then to be told no the AI version is gorgeous it&rsquo;s art it&rsquo;s bigger it&rsquo;s more it&rsquo;s better.  How confusing is it that I have to go on the internet and see a deepfake of my own president.  I don&rsquo;t even need to mention what they&rsquo;re doing to women with deepfakes.  Everyday I watch this spiral more and more out of hand and my lawmakers do nothing they say nothing it&rsquo;s exhausting.  When I look to the arts I don&rsquo;t want to see artificial intelligences purging made from real peoples work, their livelihood, their raw emotions, and their ideas that have all been disregarded in the name of technological advancement.  Regulation in needed in order to protect creators and copyright holders and they can be made in a way that doesn&rsquo;t hinder innovation.  This is common sense.
