It is disheartening to see humanity erased by technology that isn&#39;t fully developed. Artificial intelligence / machine learning requires lots of data to function. It is unfair that people&#39;s works are being used to train these models, but aren&#39;t being compensated. Artificial intelligence models can be used to assist people not replace them. It is my understanding that whatever a person creates is considered to have copyright even if it is not registered. If people&#39;s works are being used without their permission this is infringing on their copyright. Regulations must be made to protect copyright holders and prevent exploitation.
