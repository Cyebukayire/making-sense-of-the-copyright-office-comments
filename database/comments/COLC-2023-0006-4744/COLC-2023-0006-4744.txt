I do not think that AI should have access to copyrighted works. I believe that it will cause more harm them good. In my eyes, AI will eliminate any author or artists ability to maintain their own copyright- so many people are having their art styles ripped off or their names attributed to works that aren&#39;t their own, but AI works, and I do not believe that AI shoupd be able to be copyrighted given what is currently happening. I personally detest AI and would be upset to see AI be available to be copyrighted.
