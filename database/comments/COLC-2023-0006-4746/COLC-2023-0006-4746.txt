I don&#39;t believe there is any ethical way to copyright anything generated from AI, especially in a creative way. All of the existing programs have been trained without consent of the original human artists that created the works, so anything of that work that attempts to copyright itself is doing so without the permission of it&#39;s direct influences. How could a company making generative AI with illegal property correct their misdeeds without simply starting from scratch? These platforms are fully built on a lack of consent and the disruption of human copyright. Supporting generative AI would directly go against existing copyrights as your office is meant to protect. I also stand by that copyright can only be granted to human-created things. Humans have something to protect of their work and livelihood, while AI does not.
