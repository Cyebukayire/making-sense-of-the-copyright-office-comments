To allow AI to train on copyrighted works is essentially saying that there is no copyright protection to begin with. AI has no ability to create a new narrative, at least not one of any depth, and AI writing and art are both forms of frankly obscene plagiarism. I fully believe the only ethical and moral thing to do is to prevent AI from training on copyrighted works. To do otherwise is to undermine the entire premise behind copyright.
