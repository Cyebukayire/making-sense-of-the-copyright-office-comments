I urge you to consider and protect artistry and artists in this pivotal period to establish rail guards.<br/><br/>I think of myself as an artist. I am in my twenties, have a relatively stable job in the video game industry, making models and 3D animations. In my spare time, I paint digitally and make my own game. I hope I make other people&#39;s day better by making them laugh, by letting them immerse themselves in the worlds I create. To offer them a form of escapism, maybe even teach important values, cultivate empathy. I enjoy my job, and I can hardly imagine myself doing anything else of my life. I think everyone should strive to find their calling, do what they like best most of the time, and build a better world around them, more understanding, more harmonious.<br/><br/>This is the antithesis to what I have seen big actors in the AI art space do. Big models built on scrapped data exploit a multitude of individual artists, competing in the same space as them. Those companies have built software using artworks to make new images. This is particularly de-humanizing to us artists, it seems like a good number of people using those software appreciate the results they get, yet will not even look at the human artworks &quot;powering&quot; them, won&#39;t credit or compensate them. I understand the satisfaction to create things by yourself, but such programs enable users to exploit the work of artists, to produce the fast-food equivalent of cuisine in various fields. I observed a growing sentiment of entitlement in online communities based around AI art, and a disconnect from &quot;&quot;traditional&quot;&quot; artists. I fear that this will extend to innocents simply discovering the technology, and teach them that any artwork (a painting, a novel, lyrics...) is ripe for the taking; all in order to make a quick buck, or for purposes of self-expression. Need I say explain how making the bastard average of a gigantic pile of artworks is contrary to self-expression...<br/><br/>I understand gravitating around the things you like, most including myself have copied someone else&#39;s drawings by tracing over it as a teen. Growing up, we discover ourselves, others, our environment. Progressively deepen our understandings of our likes and dislikes, spontaneously want to create drawings, films, etc. The mediums of expression shape what we can do.<br/>To draw a character with a certain level of fidelity, you will have to learn some anatomy, perspective, practice drawing many times... We are bound by some technical limitations, which on the flip side allows us to do some &quot;outside of the box&quot; thinking, allows us to amaze ourselves and others. One of the promises of programs such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney is allowing us to create any image we like, in a matter of seconds. This convenience is attractive, but I find it has the perverse effect of diminishing the artistic value. Over abundance makes everything matter less. Who&#39;s going to appreciate an illustration when they are as common as the pebbles in a river? Not to mention the decrease in quality and innovation, and the meaninglessness of the story that may be depicted.<br/>A lot of people cared very little when AI art encroached on visual artists, but reacted vehemently when they heard about AI generated songs. People usually have a face and a name to identify the artist they like the songs of, so it is easier for the wider public to see the artistic issue with AI art when a song talks about personal life experiences; but reveals itself to be merely the product of a machine.<br/><br/>I have seen colleagues use AI art; but in doing so produced less fitting and compelling work. I also recently met in person a family member that&#39;s more of a business-man. He&#39;s rather tech-savvy, and started making a living selling models based on image recognition or generation to various clients. He told me he was concerned with copyright issues, and would never sell models based on stolen art. He told me about one of his clients, a big game studio that wanted a way to generate outfits for characters. He produced this model, after all the studio handed him the artworks they owned. What he wasn&#39;t thinking about is the artists the studio replaced to cut costs, with the very work they produced...<br/><br/>Not everyone HAS to care and know about every field of Art, not everyone has the same sensibilities. But I think there should be laws and preventive measures against theft, unfair competition and downstream harm in all fields of Art.<br/><br/>I have read posts online about demoralized young people in their high-school years telling how they were thinking about giving up on arts, because that seemed &quot;pointless&quot; seeing how now anybody can generate hundreds of pictures in the snap of a finger. Young people are influenced easily, they will believe what they are told. I fear that many would-be amazing artists will never come to exist for the same reason.<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/><br/>Thank you for reading me and considering my, and by extension, many artists&#39; point of view.
