A.I. has it&#39;s uses. However, A.I. is not an individual&mdash;it can not and does not create anything that can be copyrighted, and can not be held accountable if it breaks the law. A.I. is also derivative, meaning it can only function based off of the data that it&#39;s given. A lot of this data is given without consent. It&#39;s databases are created off of stolen property, which remains unregulated. A.I. can not create anything artistic. When I engage with art, I do so with the intent of trying to understand another person. You can see how this becomes a problem when engaging with &quot;art&quot; created by A.I.&mdash;it&#39;s a sad world we live in, where art is automated and assembly lines are manned by people.
