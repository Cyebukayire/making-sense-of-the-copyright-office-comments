AI in use with artwork and creative writing has a severe flaw- to be able to do what it does, i.e. generate &#39;unique&#39; imagery an prose, it must first be trained by inputting previously existing artwork and/or writing, depending on the creative form. However, no protections have been provided to prevent the works of writers and artists from being &#39;scraped&#39; from the internet, scanned from books, magazines or freestanding art, for this training. This is, in essence, theft of the the creative output of writers and artists, to which they recieve neither credit nor renumeration. This of course also applies to musical compositions. As it currently stands, such theft is rampant, and it is causing grave harm to the artistic, musical and writing communities, and cannot be allowed to continue. Any creative&#39;s work should be protected from being collected without credit or renumeration for use in generative AI.<br/>The reason for this is simple- thie art and writing and music is their livelihood. Their careers, or even just their hobbies. They should not have to fear that someone is duplicating their work and undercutting their careers and creativity.
