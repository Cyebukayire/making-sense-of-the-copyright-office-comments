I&rsquo;m not an American citizen, but I upload my original plot lines and fan fictions to archiveofourown.org. My works contain ideas and sentences that I aim to reuse in other works of mine. Reportedly the website has been getting scraped for AI without the consent of the admin team, the authors whose works are used for the fanfics, or the writers and artists who made the works on this site. I have spend hours of my life on writing those works, some of them full novel length and to see them appropriated like that without repercussions hurts me.
