As both a Creative Writing student and upcoming writer, to me, the usage of A.I. to steal our works without consent is a crude violation of the time and effort poured into creating stories and scenarios. No matter how easy and cost effective is using A.I., just simply ideas from multiple sources does not compare to the boundless potential of human creativity. A.I. should be instead used by us artists as a tool to help us with first drafts or experimental ideas. Please consider this in mind when making your decision.
