A.I. is trained off of millions of skilled peoples work from across multiple disciplines without their knowledge or consent for the purpose of replacing them. The precedent it would set by allowing A.I. generated media to be copyrighted would be devastating. It would allow the unskilled to profit off of skilled peoples labor. It would reframe learning and expertise as costly inconveniences to be eliminated in the name of efficiency. It would turn fairly compensating skilled labor into an act of charity rather than necessity. Eliminating careers that use skilled labor by replacing them with automation will de-incentivize future generations from cultivating those skills. Just as calculators and spellcheck have become crutches in lieu of actual aptitude in spelling and arithmetic, A.I. will be the crutches for entire disciplines such as writing, music and art. The natural outcome will be a very ignorant society that&rsquo;s completely dependent on tech, unaware of what cognitive skills they&rsquo;ve lost, skills their predecessors chose to give up.
