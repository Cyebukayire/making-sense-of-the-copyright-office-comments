Any &quot;art&quot; or &quot;writing&quot; or other media created by AI (Artificial Intelligence) should not be considered at all as something that can be copyrighted. This media has not been created or touched by any person who could own the copyright and is instead condensing a &quot;collection&quot; of media content. This &quot;collection&quot; it uses is content that was created by individuals and has been used to &quot;train&quot; the AI without their consent. Because of this, nothing it makes can be considered an original thought or concept.
