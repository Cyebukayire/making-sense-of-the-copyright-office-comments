AI generative works use human-made works to generate the output by scraping websites for data. Image and word generators do not notify artists and authors that AI data pools are scraping their work, and many people cannot protect themselves from AI scraping their online portfolios. While the process of generating an AI image or written work may be initiated by a human, the human-made works the AI sources are still gained without prior knowledge or consent, and the law should treat this as theft and/or copyright infringement.
