I think the use of AI in any creative medium (ex. films, art, etc.) is a direct threat to why art is made in the first place, that being the human condition itself. Art is made because we as humans see the world around us in different perspectives, and AI cannot replicate that or replace it in any form. Corporations are intrigued by AI because they see art as disposable. Something to hang up on their wall and occasionally glance at to remind themselves of how powerful they think they are. Without art that can show us the human perspective, we would not be able to understand the world we live in like we do now. AI cannot form ideas on its own, it can only look at the work of others and replicate it. That represents the occasional glance corporations have at art. They don&#39;t look at it and try to understand it or relate to it. They look at it for less than a second and think about how they can exploit it. Maybe AI could have a place in the creative medium, but whatever that place is, they are not considering that at the moment. They are considering how they can replace us for their own financial gain.
