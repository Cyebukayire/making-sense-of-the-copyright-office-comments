The rise of AI art that profits off of the work of any artists that post their work online has caused me to fear posting my work. If my work gets lots of attention, there&#39;s absolutely nothing I can do to stop people from using AI to copy my style and artwork with little to no effort. Something needs to be done before this gets even further out of hand.
