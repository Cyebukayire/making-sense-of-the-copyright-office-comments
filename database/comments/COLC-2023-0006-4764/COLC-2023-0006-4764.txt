i don&#39;t think ai should be allowed to scrape or use works that they hadn&#39;t obtained prior permission to do so- like, chatgpt scraped the website archiveofourown, which i publish on. i locked all of my works when i heard about that. it felt like a theft. it&#39;s a little bit gutting to know that my writing, which i write for fun and enjoyment, is being used in whatever little capacity to feed a chatbot. and it&#39;s just... it&#39;s theft. worse than that because it&#39;s being trained on people&#39;s work who havent consented to it. i don&#39;t like that it&#39;s legal in any capacity. there should be things they need to do before this! contacting the original artists or authors or whatever. obtaining written permission! and compensation! and there&#39;s the whole thing about voices and deepfakes and it&#39;s just... i don&#39;t think it&#39;s ethical to let that loose on everybody on the internet. i&#39;m against using generative ai on anything who&#39;s original creators haven&#39;t consented to the process. i&#39;m against deepfakes and generative ai and all that stuff being used to mimic real living human beings. <br/><br/>artists and writers need to give consent and receive compensation to be included in a training set, and images and writing resulting from ai should not be eligible for copyright or maybe even payment without significant further human manipulation/improvement of the generated image or writing. thank you for your time
