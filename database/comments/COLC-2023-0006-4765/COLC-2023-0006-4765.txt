Neither generative AI or clear-thinking Humans should be allowed to Patent-Trademark or Copyright anything until both the Patent and Copyright systems are corrected for fairness. Currently the Patent and Trademark system is completely broken in-favor of entities with deep pockets. Just look at the Patent system - the winners these days are always &quot;First to File&quot; clients, not &quot;First to Invent&quot;. As a private citizen and self-employed degreed Electrical Engineer, I no longer have the time nor money to patent an invention of my own making before being hijacked by a large corporation or the Chinese Communist Party with an army of patent trolls watching the watchers. The same will happen to the copyright system - and wait for AI to start watching the patent system too (if it isn&#39;t already)! The whole U.S. patent-trademark and copyright system will be weaponized as an adversarial of creative Humans. Stop it before it gets out of control.
