I do not believe AI models should be permitted to use copyrighted works in their training data. AI cannot produce anything without a dataset. It completely relies on its input, thus owing any degree of output efficacy to the source of its input. Any works used to train an AI model should be free of copyright, because the output is not able to ascribe credit.<br/><br/>As I understand, it&#39;s like a digital blender; the input is converted into mathematical patterns. These patterns don&#39;t retain any information that can be used to indicate their source when they are used to create output, and thus cannot give specific credit to the sourced input. The credit would be reduced to &quot;every piece that has been used to train this model,&quot; which is millions of pieces in larger or generalized models.<br/><br/>AI output should also not be copyrightable. In addition to being a pattern system completely reliant on its input, what little human element is involved in the output (for visual art) is the equivalent of an image search. It boils down to knowing what key words will give what you want; and in many cases, some of the key words are the names of specific artists. Without those specific artists, AI models often don&#39;t give &quot;satisfactory&quot; output, and thus doubly owe any success to those individuals; both for the training data, and the recognition of their name and the corresponding style.<br/><br/>Additionally, since AI models are pattern recognition tools based on massive amounts of input that in some cases isn&#39;t (or doesn&#39;t seem to be) regulated, its quality is highly subject to deterioration. I know several people who have had to stop using writing- or spell-checkers that started using AI models, because the suggested &quot;corrections&quot; are recognizably worse, or outright incorrect. For people who aren&#39;t skilled or trained enough to recognize and ignore such bad suggestions, their work is likely suffering, errors compounding as more people input and reinforce errors.<br/><br/>If AI models are permitted to be trained on copyrighted works, anyone whose work is input into a model must be compensated. The only way to ensure this is to keep models as closed systems that users cannot add input to. The compensation itself would need to have at minimum a large initial payment as would be expected of acquiring permission to repeatedly use a copyrighted work. The terms would also likely need to be reviewed and addressed frequently, with potential bonus payments based on the success of the AI model. This is an emerging technology, and it&#39;s not possible to predict whether a standard initial payment is worth the ultimate, possibly-indefinite output of an AI model.<br/><br/>There have also been instances of companies firing their entire art team, with the intent to replace them with an AI model, often to be utilized as a secondary responsibility by someone with a separate job title. If this is allowed to happen on a large scale, many artists will no longer be able to support themselves by producing art. Having to work a separate job for income reduces the amount of time and energy for art production, so original human-made art risks decreasing. This, in turn, would likely cause the eventual collapse of the companies that adopted AI and fired their art teams. AI models need constant new input to improve and avoid, and if the majority of input they have access to was AI output, the regressive pattern recognition eventually removes outliers, and is unable to create &quot;satisfactory&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; output.<br/><br/>Personally speaking, I struggle every time I create an illustration to decide whether to share it. The only way to guarantee that my art is not being used without my permission to train an AI model is to not make it available in the first place. Or, alternatively, to not create it in the first place. AI models are largely being used by people who want to replace or harass artists, rather than by artists themselves. They discourage the creation and sharing of art, rather than advancing the ability of artists to create. AI models output &quot;finished&quot; works that often require editing; so any potential use of them by an artist would categorically make them an image editor or writing editor, rather than an illustrator or writer. AI models have been created as attempted replacements of artists, not tools for artists to use. By and large, they do not encourage truly original human creations.
