Generative AI is incredibly harmful to artists and all peoples due to its presence in many unavoidable areas of modern life. From the news, to search engine results, to published books AI is everywhere and that is not a good thing. Generative AI is taught by scraping the posted works of artists, writers, scientists, and creators and publishers of all kinds. This is a violation of the rights of these creators as now their skills, talents, and opportunities are stolen from them by a machine who cannot do this work without exploitation. This destroys economic opportunities for these creators, twists their words and art in ways that can slander them, and threatens to undermine the integrity of any person with AI generated falsehoods. AI is entirely negative and has no redeeming qualities at this point in time. Additionally, AI is incredibly susceptible to attack by even the most layman hackers. Tell any AI a falsehood enough times and it will repeat it as the truth, and if the information originally fed to it was false, then this is only exacerbated. And finally, AI only makes the biases in our own society larger, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, or any such other derogatory behavior and thoughts is only exaggerated by the AI learning models and contributes to harmful and dangerous misinformation and behaviors.
