I believe AI is something that needs to be moderated with laws and regulations. Over the past couple years we have seen numerous AI works ranging in how much it affects others. Things such as AI deepfakes and AI art and voices affect many people who have not consented for their images, art, or voice to be used by other people. These things are actively effecting peoples jobs and public image. Especially AI deepfakes.
