I simply want to voice my disapproval for AI generated art that was trained on stolen data.<br/>I am not against the general technology, just against the unethical way these models were trained. <br/>If a company can proof that they have the consent for ALL the data they used to train their AI models then I would be okay if the material created with these models are copyrightable, otherwise I&#39;m not. And the burden of proof should be on the side of the AI developer not the artists.<br/><br/>I&#39;m not expecting much from the US in terms of justice these days, but I still wanted to make my voice heard.<br/>We will see, but my bets are on the EU to keep US corporations in check once again.
