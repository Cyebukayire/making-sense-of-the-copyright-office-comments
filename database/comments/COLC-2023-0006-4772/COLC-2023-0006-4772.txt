I am a digital artist and designer who has about a decades worth of growing my craft on various internet platforms. In the past year, generative AI images have begun taking hold in my field, and appearing much more frequently. These images have been mimicking the techniques and styles of real life artists, most often without their permission. Despite the supposed transformative nature of generative A.I., this technology requires the works of real human artists and writers in order for the generative A.I. to piece together what seems like a &quot;new&quot; creation. This piece of work however does not fulfill the originality requirement of copyright, because  generative A.I. works are not inherently original. The human element of entering prompts into a generative A.I. is not valid &quot;originality&quot; because those entries merely fetch from the vast catalogs of the A.I. databases, which are using already copyrighted work, to then structure it&#39;s own work. Due to the nature of generative A.I., I find it impossible for it&#39;s works to be considered &quot;original&quot;, therefore I believe that it is also impossible for generative A.I. works to be granted copyright protections. Protecting original, creative, evocative pieces of art and writing are essential to a functioning society, on a global scale. I personally fear of what might become if generative A.I. is granted legitimacy, scrapping millennia of original human creations, and instead regurgitating unoriginal text and images for the sake of the uncreative in the world to make a profit off of other&#39;s work. Thank you for opening these comments publicly and taking them into consideration.
