Why are we allowing people to call AI art theirs, when it was clearly generated by the AI itself. What a AI &quot;artist&quot; does is type a few words, a command really, and the AI responds. How can it be called their creativity when they do none of the work but tell the AI to generate what they want? <br/><br/>People claim that this is the new stage of technology, but it isn&#39;t. The AI is not autonomous. The ideas it creates are not of it&#39;s own. To call it an Artificial Intelligence is extremely disingenuous. It is an algorithm that uses the efforts of others in order to create an idea of what the AI &quot;artist&quot; commands. And to allow this technology to become copyrighted like art does is a slap in the face to the real humans who work hard at their craft. <br/><br/>I can understand the desire for this. It&#39;s easy. It&#39;s there at a click of the button. It&#39;s free work from a machine who will not complain about the costs, who will obey your every whim. Who cares that the fine details are missing. Who cares that this will corrode away creativity and art, two things that are already in danger in our present society. It&#39;s convenient. <br/><br/>But conveniency is not what we should be striving for when it comes to these practices that are intrinsic to humans! Will we leave the work of creativity up to machines while humans continue to toil away at their jobs? This is not the future that anyone should strive for. We should look towards a future where people are able to be better connected to that part of themselves, rather than just being focused on being a good worker for their company. <br/><br/>Don&#39;t allow this to happen. We can stop this before it becomes widespread, before companies have the excuse to cut out humans entirely from creative work and instead lock them into labor.
