Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment. As an artist whose work appears online and who accesses art communities online, it is important to me that this be addressed. <br/><br/>&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a misnomer when referring to the extrapolations of data sets that are referred to as &quot;AI&quot;, i.e. Chat GPT, Midjourney, etc. The models these programs are built on use unethically sourced content, without the consent of the original creators and publishers. It should not be legal to copyright or profit from works stolen and recycled through these filtering programs. It is my opinion that the intent behind the datasets currently being utilized is to misuse material created by others for profit, and that the way to fight against theft and misuse out from the equation is to prevent copyright of the items being generated. The people compiling (&quot;scraping&quot;) these datasets tout the technology as &quot;inevitable&quot;, and creation of new datasets isn&#39;t possible to prevent, but it is possible to incentivize ethical models and disincentivize those built on unethically sourced materials. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and your consideration on this matter.
