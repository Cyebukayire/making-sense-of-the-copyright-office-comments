The current state of &quot;AI&quot; is more artificial than it is intelligent. It does not make anything new and is little more than a rebranding of machine learning, which is a very useful tool in many circumstances but should not be mistaken for original creation. What is currently touted as AI is the result of taking human creation without credit, and morphing it into something derivative. It is technically intriguing and 99 times out of 100 artistically devoid of merit. An artist may combine previously extent material to say something about and with those component parts, but AI and the way it is being built only wishes to copy. From a financial point of view, it is ultimately harmful to those working in creative mediums. Why hire an artist/photographer/musician/author to make something unique and good when you can buy a program that will regurgitate something &quot;good enough&quot;. A prospect that hurts jobs as well as the end product consumers experience. As a musician, I have very little fear of &quot;AI&quot; replacing me from a skill stand point, but I feel a precedent must be set that something Artificially Generated (which, again, must be trained on uncredited references from real human artists) must not hold the same weight in ownership and copyright. Without naming and crediting the thousands of people whose work train &quot;AI&quot; models (often without consent), it seems impossible and unjust to dole out copyrights to the users of AI tools. AI (machine learning) has many good uses, but generating new and unique artistic materials is so rarely one that I urge whoever is reading this to consider AI generated materials uncopyrightable.
