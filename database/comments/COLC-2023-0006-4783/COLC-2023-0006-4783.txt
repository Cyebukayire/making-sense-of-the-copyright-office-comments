Anything that is trained and created using other peoples creations should not be able to be copyrighted without significant personal additions. Not only is it insulting to creators who have dedicated their time to learning the skill, but it&rsquo;s actually damaging to their lives as well. Big companies do not want to hire real artists, writers, voice actors, background actors, when they can have a computer do it for them for cheaper because a program doesn&#39;t need a living wage to survive. And many people can not survive of of small businesses and work within their communities. All these people who are responsible for these programs even existing can no longer support themselves because a soulless program  stole their creations and spat it back out as a worse and cheaper version. It should not be able to be copyrighted because the copyright could rightfully belong to thousands of people. I never though I&rsquo;d live in a world where I&rsquo;d have to stop a machine or program from stealing jobs centered around human creativity and practiced skill. Its a fun idea to mess with seeing what a program can come up with but based on what it is at its core and the damage it will have on society AI generated content should not be able to be copyrighted.
