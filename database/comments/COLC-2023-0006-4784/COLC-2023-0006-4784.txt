Hello! I am Sarah Matear, from Canada. I know this may disqualify my comment from being relevant, but as decisions made in the US affect the world, I feel my thoughts on the matter may prove useful anyways.<br/><br/>Algorithmic Imitation Technology (AIT or AI for short) is a massive threat to the livelihood and rights of writers, artists, and other creative people. It is being used to replace them, forcing people already in an unstable economic standing even further into economic difficulty.  Many AIT programs are also trained using stories and images unintended for the purpose of corporate mass production, without creator consent. Though the &#39;data&#39; used to train these programs might not be saved directly, the results of that training are forever embedded in the AIT program. That being said, some actually are made to outright mimic specific art or writing styles. The creators whose content was taken and mimicked receive no compensation or credit for the products of these programs, and as such it can be seen as a type of theft. It is entirely unconstitutional and unethical.<br/><br/>Furthermore, many universities define plagiarism as &quot;submitting work that is not one&#39;s own&quot;. Any content created using AIT programs is therefore plagiarism on top of theft. The programs are not designed with crediting the original source material, and the users of AIT do not seem bothered to remedy this.<br/><br/>Great civilizations in the past are not remembered solely for their money and economics and businesses. They are are chiefly remembered for their art styles, their architecture, their culture. By forcing artists and writers and so on out of creating things, there will be no soul in our culture. We will have massed produced drivel that is unappealing and unethical.<br/><br/>As a concerned neighbour and artist who has had my works stolen before, please. I get that many people don&#39;t see art as anything more than lines on a page, or a product to make and consume with zero regards to ethics... but please. Please, please, please. Do not blind yourself to the unethical practices behind Algorithmic Imitation Technology. Or &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, as it has so wrongfully been branded. There is no intelligence here. There is only immorality and entitlement to the hard work of others.
