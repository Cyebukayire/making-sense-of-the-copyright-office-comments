I believe artists can potentially be threatened by the growing influence of AI generated media. Our livelihood, the way we make money and gain influence in an economy continually mounting itself against us, may potentially be removed from relevance using programs that took our ideas, blended them together and rebranded them as their own. I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that&rsquo;s not a fun prospect. Creative media AI&rsquo;s influence should be limited to non-commercial, personal projects, and AI should only be fed works that have been created and given explicitly for the cause by the user or the creator of the AI. This goes for writing, visual art, music, sound design, and anything else under the creative umbrella. It would be impossible to overstate how upset I&rsquo;d be if my lengthy, pricy 4-year education as a video game scoring major was upstaged by a program that mashes together the work of other established musicians. It should be common sense.
