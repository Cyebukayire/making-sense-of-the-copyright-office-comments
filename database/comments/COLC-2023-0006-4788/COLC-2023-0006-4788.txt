I think every artist and creator are entitled copyright of their original works. If an AI collects or scans from artists/creators works each artist/creator should get credit and monetary compensation for it. The trouble might be how to track it. Metadata IPTC already exists but if someone could ad way to trace the artists even after the fact of AI. Interestingly it already exists in form of blockchain technology with smart contracts. Which blockchain is best suited for it and who could implement that tech into digital assists needs to be researched. I asked ChatGTP how this could be done and got a sensible todo-list of how to go about it, (not specifying any companies). <br/>Thanks
