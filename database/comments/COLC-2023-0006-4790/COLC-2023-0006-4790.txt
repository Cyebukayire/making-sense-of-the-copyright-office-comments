AI generated content should not be protected by copyright. AI is incapable of creating anything original, and it is all a mismash of copyrighted works thrown together. To allow copyright for AI works, would essentially be allowing someone to take a part of someone else&#39;s already copyrighted work, and copyright that small portion differently. There is no human element of originality in the art AI makes, it can only steal.
