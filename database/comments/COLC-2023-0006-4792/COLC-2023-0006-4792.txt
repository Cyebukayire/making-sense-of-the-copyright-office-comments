The use of AI for for creative works serves only to steal from artists who actually created things, all for the benefits of people who didn&#39;t put any actual work into the creative process. As such, I believe it should be disqualified from any sort of copyright protection which would normally be in place for creative works, as they are made by violating other artists rights. Additionally it opens up too many possibilities for a violation of consent for people, whether professional actors or otherwise, to be used in content they may not have any knowledge of, or that they do not believe in or support (such as AI manipulation of voice, deepfake pornography, other libelous usage). The added factors put forth by Studios in their attempts to scan in people&#39;s likenesses for a small fee to then be used in perpetuity with no further compensation or consent to the content is an additional violation. Flat out, it should not be allowed because the damage it will do to do many people is not worth the potential benefit for very few, who again, would not be engaging in the creative process at all.
