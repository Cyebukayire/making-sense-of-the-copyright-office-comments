As a freelance artist, I believe that creations generated by AI should not receive any form of Copyright protection and should instead be held responsible for copyright infringement, because of the abundance of copyrighted material fed into the AI models as a part of its datasets, from which the generated work is made from. Copyright protection given to AI generated material would only cause more financial struggles for professionals of the entertainment/creative industry, given that it is often using their works as part of the datasets, that was not given with consent or permission of the original creator, therefore causing an economic downturn brought on by a massive drop in revenue given to those previously mentioned professionals. Copyright protection should instead be given to any and all sources of data used for AI models, and can be only be given rights of use upon agreed terms between both parties involved, that including the Human creator/source of data and the owner of the AI models, for example, through an opt-in method as oppose to having to opt-out, a method that would require the original data owners to be aware that their data/property was used in datasets for AI models without permission.
