I strongly believe that the current AI generators have violated copyright by training on artists and authors work without consent or compensation. I think that any AI tool should only be allowed to use material that they have gained permission to use to train their AI tool. This may mean that the current AI tools have to be destroyed if it is not possible to remove all of the material they have been trained on without permission from their memory. <br/>I also believe that it should be a requirement for any company or person who uses AI in a product to disclose that they have done so. For example if a book cover image has been created with AI I think it should be required that it says so on the cover.
