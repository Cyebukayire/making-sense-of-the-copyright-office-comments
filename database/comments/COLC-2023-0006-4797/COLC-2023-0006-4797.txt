Material generated using ai models should not be copyrighted. <br/>Ai is scraping public and freely posted content such as blog posts, original stories, and images without consent of users then generating content and selling them as their own. Ai takes advantage of the public&#39;s creative freedom. As a model trained on patterns, &quot;styles&quot; of copywrited art are already being produced and exploited without the original artist&#39;s knowledge. Ai technology is growing at too fast a rate, and without copyright regulation, cheap, unoriginal outsourced media from robots will be the norm.
