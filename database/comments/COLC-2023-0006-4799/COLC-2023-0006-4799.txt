A.I is theft. The programs are all using funneled artwork from artists that were never compensated or asked for permission. It&#39;s also lacking the human touch of real creativity by using a text base mechanic that only takes ideas without the user actually having to do the creative thinking themselves. A.I is a threat to creativity and absolutely shouldn&#39;t be allowed to be copyrighted what so ever. <br/><br/>If you allow it to be able to be copyrighted thousands of artists will lose jobs ( Japan animation studios have started using A.I) and as human beings we will lose what makes our society even the least bit creative. A.I is a thieving tool.
