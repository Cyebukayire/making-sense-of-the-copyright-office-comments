AI takes the voices/writing/illustrations of artists. Often without permission or even against the victims&#39; wills. At the very least, AI should be heavily regulated to protect artists, as these fields are already competitive and difficult to make a living off of as is. Not to mention, they can be used for at least morally bankrupt actions, if not highly legally dubious actions. Often times making consumers pay for simply things that weren&#39;t made by people. Protect artists. Protect consumers. Thank you.
