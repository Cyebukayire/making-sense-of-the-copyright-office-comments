speaking briefly as an artist as well as just a decent human, gAI as it is now is unregulated and the ones responsible for stealing and scraping the image data of millions of artists without permission or compensation, I understand that this technology will not go away, but I at least want there to be a legal system in place to make sure it is done right, that being said, I believe that images created by Generative AI cannot qualify as copyrightable or hold any inherent copyright of any kind seeing as there was no human authorship, only a large data set created from the stolen work of artist with the malice and disregard for the art and creators who made the art and never opted into their data being stolen. Any opportunity given to express my concerns and desires to regulate the gAI as it develops faster than any legal precedents that can be made against it, I believe it is overall harmful and if it cannot be stopped i&#39;d rather it be commercially useless
