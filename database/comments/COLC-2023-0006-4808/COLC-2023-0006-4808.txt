They said that Archives of our own (one of the most visited site of the world) which host fanfictions (writings works) has been scrapped by AI bots. WHile Fanfictions are not copyrighted because of their very nature, the work / the way the story are written the choice of words belong to the author who wrote it and they were scanned -analyzed and copied and trained their AI without consent both from the site and the users. This is a MONDIAL problem as AO3 host fics from severals country not just the USA.
