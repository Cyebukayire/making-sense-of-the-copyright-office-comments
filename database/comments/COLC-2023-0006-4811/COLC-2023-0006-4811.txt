I believe that AI generated works should not be able to be copyrighted. They are an algamation of other people&#39;s artistic styles, and the fact that the only human involvement when making a piece of art using AI, be it literature or a picture, or even somebody&#39;s voice, (and using somebody&#39;s voice to make them say something they never have using AI is incredibly creepy by the way, and should be illegal), is usually just typing a prompt into a computer is just lazy. Writers and artists put a lot of soul into their work, and do not deserve to have lazy rich people, who just want to get something produced without paying their writers properly, coming up behind them and stealing their livelihood with a computer. Copyrighting AI generated works would likely open up a whole new level of disaster amongst artists and is just a bad idea overall
