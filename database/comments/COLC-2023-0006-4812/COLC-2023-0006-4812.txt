Existing copyright laws can&#39;t fully apply to artificial intelligence and the content generated by it. The power of AI is so vast that it would be unfair to have it play by the same rules as human creators.<br/><br/>1) Human content creators whose content has been used to train an AI should be eligible to receive small royalties if the AI companies generate profit through the models trained on that human content. The royalties don&#39;t have to be so big that innovation in AI is completely stifled, in fact innovation in AI should generally be encouraged and training new models should be made as easy as possible, but human creators shouldn&#39;t be left out in the cold either.<br/><br/>2) Somewhat related to the above, ideally, the content created by the AI should have a form of shared copyright between the entities prompting the AI for the generated content, and the specific creators whose content was used to train and then generate the newly generated content. Since the part of granting copyright to specific creators whose data was used for training the AI may not be feasible to implement in the short term, a simpler model of shared copyright can be implemented, where all the human creators whose data was used to train the AIs get a small share of the copyright.<br/><br/>3) On this item, maybe the same rules as for infringing on works created by humans can apply.<br/><br/>4) If the output generated in the style of a human artist generates profit, the human artist should be entitled to a portion of the profit, or even the entirety of it. If the generated content is used under the Fair Use doctrine, then the same rules as Fair Use can apply.
