Ai relies on the artworks, recordings, and writings of humans to generate art/text. Someone putting a prompt into an ai generator is not actually creating the art themselves, they are not putting in hours of work to make something. There is no thought or emotion, no devotion in these generated works. Since ai relies on works stolen from someone else, copyright should not be applied to ai generated work.
