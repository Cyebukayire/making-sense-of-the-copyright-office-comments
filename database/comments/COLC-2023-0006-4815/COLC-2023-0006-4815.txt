AI technology only works when it is allowed to steal the work of artist and writers to base its work off of. It is theft and it harms artist. It threatens the jobs and livelihoods of artist and writers alike. It will also be used to replace actors, spread false information, write fake articles or studies, and that isnjust the beginning. What it is already doing. Please regulate AI technology to protect tje work of artists and writers, and protect the average America from disinformation spat out by AI to intentionally mislead the American people
