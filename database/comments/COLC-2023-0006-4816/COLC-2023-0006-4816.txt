Artificial Intelligence (AI) is indeed artificial, but it is in NO way intelligent. The same people who seek to peddle pyramid schemes like cryptocurrency and NFTs now are attempting to rebrand Machine Learning and profit off it. And many companies are being quick to jump on the bandwagon to this new digital gold rush. Everything is starting to have &quot;AI&quot; be added to it, whether it would actually benefit from it or not. But the truth is, nobody but the people selling it gain any benefit. Machine Learning doesn&#39;t actually learn how to do anything on its own. It can be fed algorithmic data and be shown how to re-combine things put into it, but it will never create something new. And the worst part of it is people are feeding it with things they stole from others. Artists especially have felt the worst impact, as &quot;AI&quot; generated art takes pieces from several different artists and mishmashes them into a horrible facsimile just because someone typed &quot;beautiful woman, large breasts, digital art&quot; into a search bar. It&#39;s disgusting. There isn&#39;t a single word of credit given towards any of the artists it took from, not a copyright to be seen save for the people using the &quot;AI&quot; who have the sheer unmitigated gall to attempt to copyright what the computer spat out for them. &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, Machine Learning, as it exists now needs to be heavily restricted and perhaps even made illegal. It shouldn&#39;t be allowed any more than you would allow someone to walk up to the Mona Lisa, take a photo, then put a filter on it and claim they made the entire thing themselves and try to sell it to you. And that is greatly simplifying the level of theft occurring and the hoops these people will jump through to claim they&#39;re entitled to payment for the &quot;effort&quot; they went through.
