First of all, thank you for opening up the comments on this issue. It&#39;s very important to me, and though I&#39;ll stay under the character limit, my thoughts are definitely going to be a little bit on the long-winded side. Please bear with me, as I truly do believe this is an INCREDIBLY important moment for the future of all artists, writers, performers... really, anyone who is involved in what we call &quot;the arts.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; is a misnomer. There is no &quot;intelligence&quot; involved, merely set of programs scraping the artistic and written creations of human beings, breaking them down into data points, and reconstituting them into something that someone then tries to sell as &quot;original.&quot; It is automated plagiarism, a grift, plain and simple. There is no greater threat to the livelihoods of artists and writers today than these soulless content regurgitators. The economic damage, lost opportunities, closed doors, and layoffs are already happening and well documented. Corporate greed is already eagerly seeking to replace as many real human jobs with robots as it is, are we seriously going to allow them to do this to the arts as well? To the very concepts that for ages we have referred to as &quot;the humanities?&quot; These programs must not be allowed to usurp the rightful position of human beings in the act of creation. Indeed, they literally cannot, because as I mentioned before, all they can do is steal, reconstitute, and spit out images and text which are vastly inferior to anything created by human hand or eye. It is for this reason that I believe that, at bare minimum, any output of an &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; program should be barred from trademark or copyright protection, rendered de facto public domain by virtue of its very existence as a product borne of cold computation rather than a living brain. That&#39;s the bare minimum. Personally, I&#39;d prefer if every small or large entity out there shamelessly swiping the hard work of actual creatives so they can repackage it and eliminate the very people whose efforts ACTUALLY made all the assets their &quot;intelligences&quot; are &quot;creating&quot; were opened up to the full force of infringement laws and sued for every penny they&#39;ve cost every individual maker out there. But more than anything, I just don&#39;t want to see the domain of artistic expression taken away from people. For many of us, it&#39;s the thing that makes life worth living. <br/><br/>And, really, it should be obvious that the humanity of a writer matters, or else why would I have to click a box insisting I&#39;m not a robot in order to submit this comment in the first place?<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
