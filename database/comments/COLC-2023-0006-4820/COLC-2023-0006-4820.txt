A.I. is an astounding tool that has the potential to completely revolutionize many aspects of our day-to-day lives. However, a large part of its usage has been extremely troubling and if left unchecked, will cause great damage to many industries.<br/><br/>In the realm of copyright, A.I. is especially troubling since no effort seems to have been made by different A.I. generators such as chat GPT to protect from stealing content from creators across the world. Not only are these creators not receiving credit for what they have created, but this will allow for companies to endlessly use A.I. to generate new works based entirely off of existing works and potentially make large sums of money, none of which is given to any of the creators whose works are stolen, to say nothing of the effects this will have on creativity.<br/><br/>As a filmmaker myself, while I love for people to find my work inspiring, I would be very upset for any of my works to be absorbed into some sort of algorithm and blended up and sold as some soulless product, one that I don&#39;t even receive any credit or money from, and I am in the same boat as many other creators. <br/><br/>In the realm of copyright, A.I. should face massive restrictions in what sources it can learn from and how they can be used in order to maintain the artistic integrity of our country&#39;s future.
