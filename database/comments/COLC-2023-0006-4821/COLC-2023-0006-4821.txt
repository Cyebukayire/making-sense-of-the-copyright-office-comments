AI should be heavily regulated. At present, programs like &quot;ChatGPT&quot; are at best plagiarism machines and at worst making up lies. There must also be oversight on how they collect information. I create stories and images for fun and share them with others, but AI programs steal my work and use it without permission. AI cannot be allowed to continue unchecked.
