Hello, I am a writer and I am concerned with unregulated A//I because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/><br/>This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. <br/><br/>The survival of artists and of the arts depends on this matter. Do better.
