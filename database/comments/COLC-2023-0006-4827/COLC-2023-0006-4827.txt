as it currently stands, ai in my view looks to be trained on multiple data sets that include artists&rsquo; original work, which ai mindlessly strips and uses to generate further images without the consent of those artists. ai can be a useful tool, but the manner in which its being used to rob artists of their hard work and destroy their credibility in the eyes of the public is incredible disheartening and miserable to see. if ai should continue as an artistic tool, artists and writers should be compensated for the content they may provide for ai to be trained upon, and ai generated images should not be able to receive copyright without significant human interference/improvement upon the image/work.
