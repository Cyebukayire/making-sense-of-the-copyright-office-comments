It is in my belief that AI art and AI programs that are capable of producing art should be strictly regulated in ways to prevent any AI tools from producing art of any kind in an independent or semi-independent capacity. While AI maybe a good tool in the learning environment, a factory/workplace, or in a military capacity it should never be used for forgery or art.
