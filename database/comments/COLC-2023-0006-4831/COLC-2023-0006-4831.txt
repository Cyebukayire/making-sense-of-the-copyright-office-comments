AI has no place in art, music, film, and television. Art is made by humans, for humans. A machine should not be allowed to scrape through an artist&rsquo;s work to copy their work, replace them, and make money off of them. Machines cannot hold copyright, and as such, AI models should have no right to scan and learn from other artist&rsquo;s work. Even as humans learn from other artists, they add their own flair and transform whatever they were taking inspiration from or referencing into something new. Machines cannot do any of this, nor should they ever hold the same rights as another human, nor should a human be allowed to profit off of AI art that steals from artists who put in effort into their work.
