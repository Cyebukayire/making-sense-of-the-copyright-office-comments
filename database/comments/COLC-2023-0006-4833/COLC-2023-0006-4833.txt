As an author, I am concerned that others may profit off of my hard work by using my writing for AI training without my consent. Those who use AI should not be allowed to copyright or profit off of stolen content. I think the best solution to this issue is if we require everyone who uses AI to show proof that they own the copyright, or have permission to use the content used in the AI&#39;s dataset.
