Hello, I am a freelance digital artist and illustrator by trade and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/><br/>This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse.<br/><br/>Unregulated AI is a threat because without regulation nor oversight many people, include myself, are at risk of losing our work and livelihoods and our brands. Our work is unprotected and viable to be &quot;scrapped&quot; or imported into generative software that copies our work to churn out (many times very poor) copies and rip-offs of our art style. While some may think &quot;people want QUALITY work, they won&#39;t use AI to just steal your style, they will certainly pay you&quot; it has unfortunately already begun affecting many of my and my colleagues client pools. There are in fact many people who do not care about quality, nor paying us our worth, and would rather have a cheap, stolen likeness of our work rather than hire us for well-crafted work. If &quot;the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness&quot; are inalienable rights, then our right to this career field should also fall within that. We want our livelihoods to be more secure against unethical practices, that take our work, our years of study and practice, and bastardizes it.<br/><br/>If you&#39;ve heard of &quot;deepfakes&quot; this issue will get WORSE, as many of those also use AI generative technology to produce the same things. <br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.<br/><br/>Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
