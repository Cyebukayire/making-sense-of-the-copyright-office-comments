Copyrighted works should not be used without permission in training generative AI, nor should AI-created works be copyrightable. Generative AIs are unable to determine whether their results copy or infringe another creator&#39;s work, nor could they do anything about it if they did. A human knows their inspirations and can add their own unique voice to a work to create something new, but the AI has no &quot;voice&quot; to add. It is simply putting words and pixels together in statistically likely combinations based on what it has seen before. The end result may appear to be something new, but it is simply a hodge-podge of existing works. While human creations at times bear that burden as well, the very fact that there is a human behind them&mdash;with their own unique story, experiences, beliefs, biases, and emotions&mdash;ensures that even a human takes no effort to obscure their inspirations will still end up creating something unique to them.<br/><br/>An AI has no story; it has an algorithm. It has no experiences; it has data. It has no beliefs, biases, or emotions; it has only Bayesian probabilities. The purpose of copyright law is to protect intellectual property, but an AI has no intellect to protect. Copyrighting an AI&#39;s creation would be no different than copyrighting an algorithm-created social media feed. The algorithm does not create the content; it simply puts it together in a way that has proven effective in the past.<br/><br/>This argument does not even begin to touch on the idea that AI can be, and currently is, used as a faulty research tool. AI cannot answer questions, because it does not understand the meaning of what it sees or says, and so, it&#39;s answers can be confidently, dangerously wrong, with no way for the user to determine the truth. Allowing AIs to use and create copyrighted works adds unwarranted credibility to a poor tool.<br/><br/>There are good and valid uses for AI, and we should be discussing what these are and pursuing them. But creating works of art&mdash;the purpose of which is to express the human experience, evoke an emotional response, and ultimately connect one human with another&mdash;is not one of those uses. It is dangerous for us to pretend it is.
