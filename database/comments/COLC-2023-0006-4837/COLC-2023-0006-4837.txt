AI is built on having stolen copyrighted material and so generated content from that copyrighted material should not be able to be copyrighted. My personal art and stories being used to generate something isn&rsquo;t the same as inspiring someone to create &mdash; instead it&rsquo;s along the lines of people stealing my work to sell on shirts and then claiming that&rsquo;s fine because they &ldquo;found it on the internet&rdquo;. Also, tangentially, there is no way to know what content has been fed into the algorithm and therefore there is no way to ever prove that it does not contain stolen content
