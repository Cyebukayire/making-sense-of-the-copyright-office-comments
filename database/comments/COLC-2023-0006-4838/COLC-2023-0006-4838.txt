AI as a concept has little application that I can think of. Deploying it to generate art (album and book covers, songs, books, films, even advertising, to name a few places where it&#39;s being widely used) is deeply wrong. The human capacity for creating new ideas and executing them in a way unique to every individual is something fundamental to us as a species, and it cannot be imitated by a trained algorithm, no matter how sophisticated. That AI is currently allowed to go unchecked and steal art from genuine humans against their will is a massive oversight on the part of everyone who could and should be doing anything about it. I personally have heard from people who are having their vital sources of income eaten into by the flood of AI-generated books on online booksellers. This isn&#39;t the future, this is happening right now, and someone needs to act to make sure AI does not continue to push real humans who have real needs and real lives into poverty and destitution.
