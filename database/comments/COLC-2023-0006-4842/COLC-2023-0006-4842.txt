AI processes, especially ones trained on large language or picture models should be severely regulated because of the possible harm and large scale disruption they can cause to the economy and employment. Likewise, many of these models use works that are not theirs to &quot;learn&quot; and have not offered the work holders the right to refuse their work from being included in the large model. This is unethical and, i believe, copyright infringing, especially as the AI&#39;s can recreate a specific artist or author&#39;s style, even when that artist has not given permission for their works to be used in the creation of these models.
