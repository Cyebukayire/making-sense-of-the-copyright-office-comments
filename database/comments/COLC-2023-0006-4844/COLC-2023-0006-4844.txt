AI being allowed to be copywritten will only incentivize big entertainment media companies like Disney and Netflix to gain more money off the backs of people AND depending on what the AI is making, it may make it impossible for actors to act in films because XYZ company &quot;owns&quot; ABC body scan, ergo the actors themselves. <br/><br/>Artists may also have a hard time because their art might end up being used and how can you use someone&#39;s art if it is already copywritten? Don&#39;t fall for the scam that is allowing AI to be copywritten. Leave AI public domain and let entertainment companies struggle. Actors, writers and artists should be paid properly for their work by these companies.
