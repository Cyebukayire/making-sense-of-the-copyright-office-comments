We stand at a crossroads&hellip; where we are faced with a choice to honor our own humanity, or give away our ability and creativity to that of AI. There are tremendous benefits in the use of AI. This is obvious. However, it has to be so closely monitored, regulated and measured so that our human touch is not lost. How many movies and stories have we seen to warn us of the dire effects. How many jobs and careers have to be lost to acknowledge the consequences.<br/><br/>I would like to voice my concern and recommend EXTREME caution when it comes to the use of AI. Please do not allow this path to strip us of our humanity. Please! If we must move forward with AI, I believe it has to be so closely guarded and held in check. The advent of this new technology has to go hand in hand with systematic changes to ensure that it does not become out of control and the human touch becomes obsolete.
