To put it simply:<br/><br/>I&#39;ve had to scrape my pre-existing internet accounts of art I&#39;ve posted, as they were either used to train AI models, or set to be used in the future. This, as well as the barriers I now face in not being able to comfortably try other platforms willing to unethically use this technology, has deprived me of a source of income. I cannot find an audience as easily nor can I trust sites who do not outwardly post initiatives to not use/host AI models and &quot;works.&quot; <br/><br/>All the while, people using this technology, built on the hard and human work of others, actively sell the produced images, often at a much cheaper price than a normal artist charges. Where an artist may be basing their prices off what will allow them to make a living, the level of detail being requested, or the purpose the image will serve, these AI &quot;artists&quot; do not have to worry about putting in time or thought. All the hard work has already been done and actively exploited from, they just need to do the amount of thinking required for something akin to a Google search, and then wait the amount of time the AI model requires to draw from all the images it stole, which in this age of technology, is mere seconds. <br/><br/>None of the content produced by this technology should be able to be copyrighted. It&#39;s like saying using a program&#39;s centering features to paste a PNG of Mickey Mouse produced officially by Disney onto a background color randomly chosen by the computer is worthy of being called its own piece, just with a million other dubiously sourced layers and soulless machine intervention. Disney didn&#39;t choose to have that image be provided for that purpose, the person behind it (if there was one to start with) didn&#39;t make anything new or properly derivative, and should this example be refined enough through other works depicting images similar, to create something that seems &quot;different&quot; enough and of enough quality as we&#39;re seeing now, it will be and is being exploited to &quot;cut costs&quot; and put real humans out of jobs.<br/><br/>Perhaps there is merit in technology like this being used in some capacity, but we will never find that answer unless they are built on ethically sourced databases where artists agreed (and preferably were compensated) to have their work be drawn upon by the programs. And if not enough artists are willing to submit images to allow for this technology to make a cohesive output, that&#39;s not on them to change. People trying to take the vulnerability and humanity out of art will just have to deal with it. <br/><br/>And on a side note:<br/>Do a simple search online of any topic and you are guaranteed to find AI-generated articles. Not only does this take away the job of a writer by stealing from their work, the content is almost exclusively wrong in some way. This can range from the absurd (such as the AI-generated article messily saying there&#39;s no African countries that start with the letter &quot;K&quot;) to the legally troublesome (such as articles &quot;sourcing&quot; from papers that don&#39;t exist with real names of real researchers credited) to the outright dangerous like that of AI-generated edible plant/fungi identification guides.
