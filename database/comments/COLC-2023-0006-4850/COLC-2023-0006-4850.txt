As a fiction author with a catalog of over 146 traditionally published works I am completely appalled by AI &quot;chat&quot; type programs using my intellectual property to generate derivative works without my consent and without any compensation.  It makes me physically ill to think that my work, which spans 38 years and encompasses hundreds of thousands of hours of hard work can be pirated and plagiarized in this way and used to create, not only derivative works, but works expressing a worldview or philosophy with which I do not agree.  Or worse, used to generate pornographic versions of my work.<br/><br/>This is piracy, and there is no other word for it.  <br/><br/>I do not believe that the US Copyright Office should allow copyright protection to these so-called &quot;works.&quot;  <br/><br/>
