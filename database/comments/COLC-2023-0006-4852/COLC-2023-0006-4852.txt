Human creation is well established legal precedent for copyright protection. An ape with a camera does not have the copyright to the photos it may take, nor does the human who gave the ape the camera. Large Language Models, popularly called AI, even with prompting can&rsquo;t be considered more than the randomly/procedurally generated material that one might get from giving a camera to an ape.
