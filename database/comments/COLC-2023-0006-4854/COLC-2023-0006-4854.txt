Anybody creating AI should have to publicly document all works &amp; data they used to train their algorithms. They should be able to use data &amp; works that are in the public domain without charge. But for all other works used to train, the writers, artists, photographers, etc should be paid. AI developers must pay creators before using their work, just like any other customer who wants to use their work. <br/><br/>This system must be set up so that AI developers have to get people&#39;s permission and pay them for their work before using it. The burden cannot be placed on writers, photographers, etc to track down and sue AI developers who use their work without permission, because the time &amp; legal fees burden would make such a system unenforceable in practice.<br/><br/>training data used and provide appropriate compensation to the owners of said data, unless the data are in public domain.  This should have to be done prior to using the training data and be the responsibility of the AI developer/provider to clear, not of the data&#39;s owner to request a stop.
