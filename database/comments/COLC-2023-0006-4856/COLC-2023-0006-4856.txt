I do not support AI and the copyrighting of AI. I do not believe AI has a place in creative spaces and should be heavily regulated to stop the spread of stolen and copied artworks. I shouldn&#39;t have to worry about posting my art on the internet just for it to be stolen and used in an AI program.
