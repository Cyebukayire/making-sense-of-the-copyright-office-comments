My comments regarding whether AI generated works should be subject to copyright protections is this... since AI generated works have taken from human creative sources and copyrighted material, AI generated works should not be permitted to retain copyright protections as the developers of that technology violated the copyrights of numerous individuals, including myself. Why should someone be permitted to create a technology, that steals content created by others as a training mechanism, be allowed to have copyright protections attributed to works created that use elements of the work created by another individual?
