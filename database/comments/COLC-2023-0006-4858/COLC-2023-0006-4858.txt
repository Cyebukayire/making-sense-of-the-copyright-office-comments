Tools have enabled works for longer than the US has issued copyrights. Ultimately, it&#39;s an individual or entity who received that copyright. Whether CAD tools are used to create a design, or a word processor to help produce a book, the resulting works originated from an original input/request of a sentient person that chose to use those tools for a specific purpose. While CAD tool may leverage laws of physics and design libraries to ensure its output meets the intended purpose, or the word processor uses a dictionary to check syntax, semantics, and spelling; using AI tools to create a works should not be considered any different than those previous examples. The concerning differences seem to be 1) the underlying data source that the AI tool leverages, and 2) the resulting productivity that a sentient person can benefit from. In the same way that I can add words to my word processor&#39;s dictionary, training an AI on a dataset of available data isn&#39;t the same thing as copying the data because it is the learnings that are retained, not the specific source works. Regarding the productivity, which will certainly present issue resulting from the sheer bulk of copyrightable material, the same could be said for what CAD and the word processor did for individuals and entities in the last 50 years. If at some point AI becomes sentient then we would need to revisit personhood more broadly than just copyright law, but until then, AI is simply a productivity tool and should be treated as such.
