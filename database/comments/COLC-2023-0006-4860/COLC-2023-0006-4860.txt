I don&rsquo;t believe work done solely, or a majority, by AI should be eligible for copyright. AI don&rsquo;t have the ability to add any personal experience to work they make, so it&rsquo;s just a combination of preexisting works. There is nothing that makes another AI incapable, or even unlikely, to create the same work independent of interaction with the first AI&rsquo;s piece. I believe a piece that has been made by an AI and edited by a human should be viewed as AI work and therefore ineligible for copyright. Editing is not something unique to an individual. Many professional editors will give very similar feedback on the same piece. Touching up some parts of an artwork to make it more natural and accurate is not sufficient to claim the piece is not solely AI work. An editor could not claim the work of a human client, so they cannot claim the work of an AI client either.
