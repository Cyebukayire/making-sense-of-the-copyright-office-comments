I am extremely alarmed that artificial intelligence (AI) technology is using copyrighted materials to &quot;train&quot; AI and generate AI content. I believe such use of copyrighted materials should be illegal.<br/>I also believe that works generated using AI tools should be ineligible for copyright protection, as they do not embody original creation.
