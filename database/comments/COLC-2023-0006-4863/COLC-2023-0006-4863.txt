AI is quite fascinating and infuriating. It cannot equal human talent and labour. Kindly let writers and artists do their work and pay them well for it instead of replacing them with AI because it will never be the same and it is also quite immoral. Use AI to help people and not push them further down the social ladder (which shouldn&#39;t exist in the first place but unfortunately does). AI can be used to done wonders. Don&#39;t waste it and harm people with it.
