I&rsquo;m glad that the Office is interested in public feedback on this topic. I am a graphic designer whose creative work appears on my personal website, and I am concerned about the possibility of AI being trained on my work, which would result in a loss of income/livelihood on my part. While I think there are some potentially useful applications of generative text and image AI, I think the current unchecked use of these models to mimic and replicate existing copyrighted work is unethical and goes against the interests of artists and writers, whose livelihoods depend on being able to profit from their own work. It is my opinion that artificial intelligence models should not be permitted to train on copyrighted works without explicit consent of the authors of those works, and I ask the Copyright Office to adopt positions finding that doing so violates the Copyright Act. Thank you for your consideration of this topic; I hope that the Office comes to a conclusion that supports the rights of the people.
