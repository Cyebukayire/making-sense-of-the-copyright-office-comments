The part that&rsquo;s morally wrong about AI image and text generation is the use of copyrighted material nonconsentually used in the AI&rsquo;s training model. I have yet to hear of an ethically sourced model. I do not think anything output solely by an AI should be able to be copyrighted. (This means anything generated completely by the computer from the start, as opposed to something like a filter overtop a legitimately taken photograph) If copyright can be extended to nonhumans, human creativity becomes limited.
