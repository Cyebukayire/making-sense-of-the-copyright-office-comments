AI should not be allowed in artistic spaces, period. In visual arts, in music, in writing, the only way for it to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; is to blatantly plagiarize people&rsquo;s work. It&rsquo;s also especially concerning that AI can replicate real people&rsquo;s voices and create audio of them saying things that they have never and would never say. That sounds like a legal nightmare to navigate, especially as internet trolls use this feature with reckless abandon because hurting people is apparently funny. AI can be useful in automating repetitive tasks, or in identifying bugs in a coding project, but it needs to stay out of artistic spaces. It&rsquo;s stealing jobs in a landscape where art is already an absurdly challenging industry to make a living in, and it&rsquo;s stealing those jobs off the backs of the artists who are already struggling to make a living. I&rsquo;m not typically one for sweeping regulations, but in this case something needs to be done.
