While AI has plenty of advantages for businesses and individuals to create helpful prompts or automate programs, the current infancy and dangers of the program outways the benefits.<br/><br/>In only the last year, I have found many articles written solely by AI that have been completely incomprehensible or flat out falsehoods. In our current era of rampant misinformation and spread of falsehoods, this is dangerous. While I do think the technology will improve with time, better regulations and extensive peer review by editors before posting should be required.<br/><br/>Secondly, the use of AI generated voices is incredibly dangerous. It be used to circumvent copyright protections of musical or recorded works as it could be seen as transformational works (depending on context). The real danger, however, is using real people&#39;s voices to say comments that may endanger someone&#39;s livelyhood or relationships. We have already seen internet jokes of AIactors lip syncing songs, AI generated presidents engaging in gaming related fights. While these can be funny, what if a violent ex uses generated AI recordings of their victim to say threats to their victim&#39;s employer? Or AI recordings of political opponents saying racist rants to sway voters? Voice actors having their job stolen because a studio can generate an actors voice for free? It&#39;s too dangerous to go on with little to no governmental regulation and protections.<br/><br/>Finally, since AI currently has no way of generating output (AI generated recordings voices, images etc.) without taking in existing input, AI creators tend to feed in art and recordings without authorization from the creators. This should absolutely have copyright protection as AI can be used to create forgeries of artistic styles that can be passed on as art from actual artists. AI does not create it&#39;s own intellectual properties, it creates facsimilies based on other intellectual properties and law should reflect that fact. We also need laws protecting creators from stolen art from large tech start ups, who pilage freely, hurting both individual artists and industries alike.<br/><br/>In conclusion, despite the advantages that AI can provide us, as it exists now, it does more harm than good. The ease of creating and spreading misinformation with the option to use generated voices from individuals or officials alike to spread misinformation even farther is dangerous. Stealing of artists work or having the abilitiy to completely eliminate entire artistic industries and communities may take away an essential piece of what makes us unique as a human society. We can have AI, but lets approach it as carefully and non-disruptive as possible and we need the support of our government to make that happen.
