AI is built by stealing the works of others. I think it&rsquo;s a cool concept, but people need to go through the proper channels of getting artists/writers permission so they can be properly credited for their contributions. There are also safety issues, people using the current AI systems out there &mdash;such as chatGPT&mdash; as a search engine and getting incorrect, sometimes dangerously so, answers. As a whole, the industry is advancing far too quickly to get proper regulations in place, and we need to step back.
