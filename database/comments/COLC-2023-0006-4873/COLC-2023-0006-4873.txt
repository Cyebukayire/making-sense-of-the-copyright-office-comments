I am a union writer in the WGA and I fear for the future where my past work is &quot;scrapped&quot; by large corporations who own LLM AI&#39;s and use that for the basis to claim copyright status for works generated by these AI&#39;s. Not only is this a pernicious unauthorized use of someone else&#39;s work, but there will be nothing novel or unique about the new work and it will not be deserving of any protected status. Worse, if we are to grant these corporations the power to literal steal we risk eroding the creative arts - forever recycling old ideas, stolen from others. New works, surprising works are not just entertainment - they help people process their own feelings, emotions and lives. And these new works must be written by flesh and blood humans. Not robots remixing and regurgitating our sweat and toil for the profit of others.
