Almost every currently known model of generative AI has been created trough use of work which was: stolen, contained watermark due to theft of it, taken from authors without asking for permission or scraped from world wide web without any consideretion of safety measures in place to avoide using content which is prohobited from use in such ay (indluding medical records).<br/>Any AI model should be be required to present full list of all work used in training and agreements/proof of sale taking place for such process.<br/>AI is nothing more than electronic version of using worg-magnets to make sentences on a fridge, except those magnets contain stolen content and it&#39;s not a human putting them together, but a robot.<br/>There is no direct creation involved in the process of creating<br/>Allowing such works to be copyrightable solely to the person using generative AI would be equivalent to allowing someone to say they are bulding cars and selling them as a New Brand, while all they do is buy parts already made by other manufacturers, according to other brands specification, and paying a factory owner to have them put together by that owner&#39;s employees.<br/>.<br/>Work based on should also not be allowed to be allowed to be copyrightable. To follow the above mentioned example, a person did not &#39;design&#39; a Ferrari simply by customizing he upholstery.
