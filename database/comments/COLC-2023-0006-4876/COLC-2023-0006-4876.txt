Even if there&#39;s a little bit of a remix element involved, taking from multiple sources, AI is nothing more than plagiarism algorithms. If we&#39;re going to use machines, we need to be using them for menial or traumatizing work so that more humans are free to make art. They should be making our lives easier so we have the opportunity to make them richer of our own accord. This needs to be tightly regulated--no human&#39;s creativity should be valued less than a machine&#39;s plagiarism of a different human&#39;s creativity. It&#39;s a vicious cycle and it needs to be stopped.
