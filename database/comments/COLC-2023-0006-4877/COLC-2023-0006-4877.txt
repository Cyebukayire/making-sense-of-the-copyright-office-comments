AI by its very nature is derivative. It is a plagiarism machine. It cannot create output that it hasn&rsquo;t gleaned or scraped from an actual human&rsquo;s copyrighted work. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to deny copyright benefits from AI and companies who want to monetize it. An algorithm cannot create, it can only plagiarize. This is what stands between creatives and the death of art itself.
