AI seems to be a huge issue in the copyright sphere. Many current AI programs train their neural nets (and thus their outputs) by non-consensually stealing work or copies of work from others, or by assuming consent where no explicit lack of consent to use others&rsquo; work can be found. They are then able to use that work to create copies for their own profit, and often make the work that they stole more open to further theft as well through insecure data storage systems. This steals profit from the original creators and puts their ownership of their own work up for question. If it&rsquo;s illegal for me as a human being to copy a painting, change a few brush strokes, and sell the copy for profit while stating that it&rsquo;s a certified original that I created, why is the same not true for a machine? Why does an algorithm have more rights and freedom from the law than a human being?
