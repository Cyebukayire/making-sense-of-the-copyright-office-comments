There&#39;s a quote I have seen floating around the internet, &quot;The computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never be allowed to make a management decision.&quot;  This I feel is true of A.I. (Which in truth is not artificial intelligence but machine learning at this point in time) in it&#39;s current format.  If A.I. intentionally or unintentionally plagiarises human work, who should face the legal reprecussions? The person asking the A.I. to create work did not also tell it to steal. The person who created the A.I. similarly did not ask it to steal--it is an unfortunate fact of current A.I. that in order to &quot;teach&quot; the A.I. to produce written words or artistic images, data from actual living persons is often used, usually without the permission of those providing the data. The scrapping of supposedly &quot;public&quot; data sets includes some innocuous sources (Public Domain works, for example) but can also include things like twitter or gmail--decidedly less &#39;public&#39; data who&#39;s users have not consented to contribute the minutae of their daily lives for the scrunity of a machine learning program or the wider audiences it can reach. Regardless of whether or not that minutae is completely innocent, people have a right to privacy even if that provacy is limiting their twitter posts to an audience of 20 people they actually know. People also have a right to the art they create and to profit off that art. Who is entitled to payment when A.I. is used to generate images which are then used for profit? Couldn&#39;t everyone involved--from the programmer of the A.I. to the person utilizing the program, to every artist or writer in the dataset used in the A.I. to generate the images or words have some claim to the profits of the work? The answer, quite obviously, is yes. So how do you copyright something created by a writing prompt that a programmer designed to produce a generative image or text from thousands, perhaps millions, of other people&#39;s already copyrighted owned works? Simply put, you can&#39;t. The computer can never be held accountable. Therefore the computer will never produce work on it&#39;s own with no outside input from programmers, datasets, or written prompts telling it what to create.  Therefore what the computer creates is not truly original or it&#39;s own intellectual property. The computer has no independent intellect therefore the computer did not truly create anything unique to itself.  A.I. is only &quot;the future&quot; if we allow a small, very loud minority of people lead us into a morally bankrupt artistic wasteland in which human work--be it simple words  artistic images, or even simple human skills like making a schedule --is devalued simply because it is human.  Computers are not our overlords and they certainly shouldn&#39;t be our artists either.
