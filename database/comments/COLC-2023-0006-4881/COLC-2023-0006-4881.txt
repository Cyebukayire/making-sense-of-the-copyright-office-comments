As someone who writes and loves to read, I feel that this topic is extremely important. It&#39;s great that it&#39;s being thought about, but I truly don&#39;t think it will help us if anything I believe it will hurt us. Using copyrighted material to train an AI will only hurt us by rendering us as less important and it will ruin our future works. AI will not learn from our works, it&#39;ll only learn how to copy steal and harm our works. We cannot lose our human authors and we cannot lose the publics access to works done by humans.
