As AI models solely rely on using works of artists, voice actors or authors to produce any output, it&#39;s up to them to decide how their work is used (NOT the AI companies):<br/>- if copyrighted material is used to train models, artists have to be paid or their material isn&#39;t to be used at all<br/>- if it is not possible to pay artists for already scraped copyrighted material, the AI is to be deleted and started from scratch (as AI is still only in its infancy, this is the best solution right now)<br/>- as AI generated imagery, voices or deep faked videos are mostly used for scam and spamming, it should be the responsibilty of AI companies to properly and visibly label the output of AI generators (watermarks that can&#39;t be erased, disclaimers, distortion in voices etc.)<br/>- do NOT make a &#39;fair use&#39; exception for AI; it is NOT used for research, only for profit<br/>- AI generated material should NOT be copyright protected, as the human input is too small; users basically just commission an &#39;artist&#39;<br/>- also: if the AI is trained on material owned by the artist, it still shouldn&#39;t be copyrightable, as the artist just trains an &#39;assistent&#39;<br/>- this accounts for all jobs: humans are to be hired before machines/AI, unless it&#39;s a very dangerous task<br/><br/>AI won&#39;t disappear. Some companies already try to hide hat they are using AI generated material (like amazon with their generated Fallout image, but people didn&#39;t buy it). It has to be properly labeled and companies have to be open about it, so people can decide on their own if they want to support a company or not. Or tell if they are being scammed.<br/>AI has so much potential, but it&#39;s only misused right now. And I want a future, where AI actually helps humans and is not used to destroy their livelihood.<br/>I&#39;m very glad people are calling out generated material. But it&#39;s the responsibility of AI companies to label it, especially in a way that can&#39;t be erased or undone by users.<br/><br/>The only reason AI generators work is because of scraping millions and millions of data and copyrighted material from people, who didn&#39;t consent to it. And AI just wouldn&#39;t work without them. That&#39;s why the key should always be: consent and opt-in only. Opt-out is not possible as AI can&#39;t be &#39;untrained&#39; or can&#39;t &#39;unlearn&#39;. <br/>Bruce Willis consented to being used for AI training, so that he could (kind of) continue his acting career.<br/>This is how it should be. With consent. And if there is no consent, copyrighted material isn&#39;t to be used at all.<br/>If an artist uses copyrighted material and tries to pass it off as their own, they get called out. It can even end in shitstorms and result in the artist being &#39;cancelled&#39;. Same goes for artists that copy other artist&#39;s styles. Why should AI be treated any differently?<br/><br/>Artists don&#39;t train on other people&#39;s works (unless they do a master study, which is ONE drawing or painting at a time, not millions, and they credit the artist they try to learn from), they use tutorials to which other artists consented to being used. To teach them how to construct and draw a human body, or animals, or trees etc. They use references to which people CONSENTED to being used for studies.<br/>They create their own technique and hone their skills. Talent is just 1% and it&#39;s just the thing that let&#39;s you learn. The other 99% are hours of studies, experiments, failures, getting up again and work your way to where you want to be. No professionell artist is where they are now without this hard work.<br/>It&#39;s not a magical ability that you get when you&#39;re born. You fucking train it.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, even with consent, no generated material should be copyrightable as it devalues human skills, creativity and art in general and, as already stated, the human input is just too small.<br/>In the end, it&#39;s artists of all kinds that will be replaced by machines with their own works used against them.<br/>It happens now and it will only get worse in the future. And I already know Artists won&#39;t be the only ones, that will be replaced.
