Some people are considering the possibility that AI generation software for art, voices, music, and text should be renamed &ldquo;plagiarism software.&rdquo; They might be onto something, as that is exactly what it is. A month ago I saw someone share a photo of a book that included text that was originally from the video game &ldquo;Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.&rdquo; Also look at the trend of &ldquo;AI song covers&rdquo; flooding YouTube and TikTok. We are seeing AI take content that isn&rsquo;t theirs without permission. Taking stuff without asking is the definition of theft. And it is time that copyright laws reflect that.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s why it may be time to rename these generative softwares as &ldquo;plagiarism&rdquo; rather than calling it artificial intelligence. By calling it &ldquo;artificial intelligence,&rdquo; the connotation gives the false impression that the software can think on the same level as a human, when it cannot. And this false notion can give abusers of the technology an excuse to abuse it. By calling it &ldquo;plagiarism,&rdquo; we deglamorize the software and unveil what it actually is: theft. AI generative software cannot truly create, only remix what you have programmed into it.<br/><br/>It is integral for the Copyright Office to establish regulations on AI. The technology is growing too fast while heads of state have their heads in the sand. The issue is growing out of control. The sooner we nip it in the bud, the less problems we will be dealing with further down the road. The legal implications are scary enough.<br/><br/>There should be exceptions to the rule, like using voice synthesis technology for someone who lost their ability to speak. Although these should be considered special circumstances.
