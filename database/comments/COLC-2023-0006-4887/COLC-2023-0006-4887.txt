Due to the way Artificial Intelligence sources copyrighted (and all) material, and reworks it without human input or intuition, I believe it is essentially violating the spirit of how copyright works by stealing the information of other&#39;s arts. This hurts companies and individuals who invest time, effort, and talent into their craft, while also devaluing quality content under a deluge of low effort (low barrier to entry) &#39;knockoffs&#39;. Overall, I believe AI content should both not be copyrightable, and also be regulated due to the dangers it can also pose via misinformation or creating &#39;deepfakes&#39; to impersonate real individuals and spread false news or propaganda.
