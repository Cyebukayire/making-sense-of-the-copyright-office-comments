AI is an unstoppable technology trend, similar to the rise of computers and the internet. New technologies often pose threats to some people while benefiting others. In the future, perhaps in 10 or 20 years, AI will relieve individuals from most writing tasks, allowing them to focus more on creativity and innovation. When computers first came onto the scene, along with various writing software like grammar checks, they significantly boosted societal productivity. Such technologies have enabled millions to write efficiently and accurately. AI is poised to have a similar impact. In my opinion, if humans and AI collaborate on a piece of writing, that work should be protected by copyright. This is similar to a person using a computer to write, and then employing grammar software to check for spelling and grammatical errors. As an example of how efficient and valuable AI can be, I wrote these comments with the assistance of AI. It dramatically increased my writing efficiency and helped me convey my opinions effectively.
