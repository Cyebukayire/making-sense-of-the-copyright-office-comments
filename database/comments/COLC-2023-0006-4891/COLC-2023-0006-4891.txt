I am a supporter of artists and authors, and I think it&rsquo;s unfair and irresponsible to train AI using copyright exclusive work. The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.&nbsp;This balances, allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.&nbsp; Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright. It is my opinion that The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act. Thank you for reading my comment, I appreciate that the Copyright Office is taking this issue seriously.
