It seems obvious that a technology which scrapes the internet for human-created content and then generates its own content based solely and entirely off human-generated content cannot be original. Moreover, when it&rsquo;s a human commanding a program to scrape other humans&rsquo; work, that&rsquo;s obviously not original. There&rsquo;s no instance where AI can generate its own content from whole cloth, it&rsquo;s always stolen by definition, especially where it&rsquo;s at the direction of a human (which is always). If human-taking-from-human is infringement, human-taking-from-computer-taking-from-human is infringement just as severe.
