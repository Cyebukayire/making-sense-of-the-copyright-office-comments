If AI generated works are given copyright protections, that creates a hostile landscape for working artists (both in the industry and freelancers). Companies are already replacing jobs with AI generated content. American artists deserve better that having to compete with machines that only aggregate information. I agree with the recent court case that copyright should require a human creates the piece of art.<br/><br/>An AI can&#39;t submit a comment for this because it has no thought. If it doesn&#39;t meet criteria to comment here, why should requirements for copyright be lesser?
