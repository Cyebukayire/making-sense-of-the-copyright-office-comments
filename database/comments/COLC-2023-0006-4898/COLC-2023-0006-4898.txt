Under no circumstances should AI generated images, text, music, or other media be copyrightable by individuals or corporations. Not only is AI generated media not art produced by people, and therefore does not require protection from infringement with respect to protecting a livelihood, artists in all media will not be able to complete with the infinite variations able to be generated and will be at risk of losing their own art to AI scraping (which is already an issue) and their own livelihoods.
