As a creative person engaging in both illustrative art as well as literature, both reading and writing my own, the idea that AI can in any capacity replicate or create in the same sense a human can is preposterous. I&#39;ve watched my artist communities be overrun with masticated garbage generated through AI, many times clearly sporting stolen artistic sources, and I&#39;ve seen my artist friends and peers lose their passion, engagement, opportunities for work, even their carefully developed personal style and creativity, to AI. <br/><br/>I vehemently oppose the use of AI and the notion that AI-created content should fall under copyright; the very core of AI &quot;art&quot; regardless of form is built on illegally scraped art and literature, stolen from artists without their knowledge or permission. The idea that someone could collect my gallery of art, spanning years, load it into a program, and have it spit out a mockery of the skill, time, and effort I&#39;ve put into my trade- Quite frankly it makes me want to stop producing art altogether, and only share what I have with a small circle of trusted friends. <br/><br/>AI-created art and literature will be a death-blow to a vibrant community of artistic expression, and as human input into the pool of material dwindles, the AI output will rapidly lose quality as it cannibalizes itself. Adopting AI or giving it any form of artistic legitimacy will only create negative fallout. Allowing AI to scrape source material from unknowing artists, denying them rightful revenue and compensation for the use of their work, will ruin careers and and communities.<br/><br/>Artists and writers deserve better than to have our work stolen and twisted in a parody of &quot;creativity&quot;. Creativity is the core of the human experience. We deserve better, and our audiences deserve better. I want to consume art that is thoughtful, carefully crafted, telling a coherent story, something that is the work of a person with passion for their craft. Not some amalgamation of unethical garbage generated by prompts. <br/><br/>Consumers of art, be it movies, books, painted art, digital art, deserve to engage with content created by and for humans. The human creativity must be protected and valued if we don&#39;t want it to vanish underneath an avalanche of soulless, artificial trash.
