The US Copyright Office should not adjust copyright regulations for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; in the current state does not fit popularly known definitions created by fiction: a self-aware, created intelligence that can serve in the place of a person. Instead, we have a complex machine-learning based reproduction of works by a created system that barely understands concepts, the beginnings of &quot;synthetic intelligence&quot; which is not self-aware and cannot serve in lieu of a person. It is, essentially, still a machine with no &quot;creative spirit&quot; inherent in humans (and possible human-like beings, or &quot;sophonts&quot;), and current copyright law does not allow for non-human (non-sophont) created works to be copyrighted.<br/><br/>2. These &quot;synthetic intelligences&quot; are trained by scraping Internet-accessible works, regardless of existing copyrights on the source works. It is highly probable that the training data sets used are in violation of copyright law. This is being adjudicated in the courts - Getty Images has sued one &quot;synthetic intelligence&quot; provider, Stability AI, over copyrights to answer questions over fair use. Thus it is likely that a copyright on &quot;synthetic intelligence&quot; generated works would be &quot;fruits from a poison tree,&quot; i.e., illegal.<br/><br/>3. Right now, and person using &quot;synthetic intelligence&quot; to generate works must perform one of many actions given the quality of the work: Rebuild the work manually by their own hand (gaining copyright normally), edit the work for release (which makes for a &quot;questionable copyright&quot;), or edit the work and regenerate it through the &quot;synthetic intelligence&quot;. This last action is essentially a curation of the work, and such curation is (from a layman&#39;s reading) copyrightable on its own. (I shall not comment that such curation inevitably takes more time to perform than the work by hand in the first place).<br/><br/>Thus any changes must be run through Congress.
