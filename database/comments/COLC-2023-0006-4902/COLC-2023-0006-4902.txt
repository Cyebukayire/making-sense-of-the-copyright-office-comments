The copyright office exists to protect the creative work of individuals, and ensure derivative work is properly credited. Technology can be wonderful and helpful, but it will never be able to create, only imitate.<br/><br/>Works from ALL forms of AI should be prohibited from being copyrighted. We are already seeing the effects of Hollywood being taken over by tech CEOs (not even the people who understand the tech). Even the fact that AI scrubbers can use people&rsquo;s writing and likeness without permission should be a copyright violation. What is to stop new work written through a cloud-based program to be scrubbed and included in an AI document before the author has even finished? Then once the author files for copyright it could be considered derivative.<br/><br/>An artificial limb will never be considered a real person. We, as a society, should not be distracted by the fancy lights of this new technology. AI is a tool, just like the software we use to write or the search engines and websites we use to research.
