As a filmmaker, with many of my friends and family members earning their livelihood through art, I find A.I. to be a threat to our job security (when used for creative purposes). I am not opposed to A.I. being used to help with data, research, or tackling repetitive information. But I certainly don&rsquo;t want to live in a world where A.I. replaces artists entirely. There needs to be restrictions on how this is used. I am also a university professor. If my students are allowed to use A.I. freely to complete their exams and write their papers, then they are learning nothing. The temptation of A.I. existing is too great for them to ignore when media has normalized it recently (even making it appear like a magical solution to all work problems). Please consider the economic repercussions of replacing artists with A.I.
