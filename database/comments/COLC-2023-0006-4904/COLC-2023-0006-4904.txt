AI scraping uses intellectual property of humans without permission or legal right to formulate a composite of those parts. This is unethical as well as copywrite infringing. Without data, these AI systems cannot work. AI is perfectly acceptable to use if the data used to train it is ethically sourced, but at its current state, this is largely not the case and is stealing work from already underpaid artists and writers for stolen and subpar results.
