Copyright infringement is worldwide--websites offer PDFs of authors&#39; work for free. AI is virtually doing the same. WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF COPYRIGHT TRIGGER WRITTEN INTO AI PROGRAMS SO THAT ANY USE OF COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL TRIGGERS A PERMISSION FORM TO THE AUTHORS WHOSE WORK IS BEING ACCESSED.  And don&#39;t tell me AI can&#39;t find authors&#39; addresses or websites. Please. <br/><br/>Government can easily require this, just as programmers can easily put this into AI programs. Humans are 100 percent responsible for AI algorithms, parameters, and functions. <br/><br/>As a writer and editor for 50 years, I&#39;ve seen a lot of developments in the publishing field, most of them positive. But AI enters new territory in which authors&#39; work can be used without their knowledge, consent, or payment. It&#39;s hard enough to make any kind of money from freelance work, novels, nonfiction books, short stories, articles, etc. without having one&#39;s work ripped off by an AI and included in some article we may not even know about. <br/><br/>We need to have a national conversation about AI, just what it is we are creating, its ramifications, and its potential for misuse--which, unfortunately, is vast.
