You&#39;re current decisions regarding Ai have been really good. It&#39;s been refreshing to see someone stop this mass theft and put the brakes on the dystopian future Ai corps want. Allowing Ai works to get copyright would essentially destroy copyright. Most Ai prompters want copyright to be abolished as it means they cannot steal work and data freely to profit from, if you allow Ai works to be copywriten you will be removing the very reason anyone gets a copy right to begin with, you will be removing that protection. So anyone after that decision simply won&#39;t need to even use you guys because Ur protection would mean nothing. Keep to you&#39;re values it&#39;s incredibly inspiring what the copy right office has fought for and defended.<br/>
