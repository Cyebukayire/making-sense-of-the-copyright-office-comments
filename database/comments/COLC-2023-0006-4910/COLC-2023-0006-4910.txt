Stability AI Ltd thus has no &quot;fair dealing&quot; defense at all in the UK.<br/><br/>https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/29A<br/><br/>https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/378/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/197222/abandon-artificial-intelligence-copyright-exemption-to-protect-uk-creative-industries-mps-say/<br/><br/>Added to that is Stability&#39;s relationship with LAION researcher in German. This appears to have violated German Copyright law &sect;60d, as private firms shouldn&#39;t have been allowed &quot;preferential access&quot; to the research. Additionally, under EU DSM copyright Directive article 3 such research should have been held securely by the research organisation and not released to the public.<br/><br/>https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_urhg/englisch_urhg.html<br/><br/>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj<br/><br/>This means there has not been &quot;lawful access&quot; to any of the data as required by copyright exceptions.
