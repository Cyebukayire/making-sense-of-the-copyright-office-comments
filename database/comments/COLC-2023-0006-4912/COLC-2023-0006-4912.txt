As a writer/editor who is eagerly diving in to the use of LLM AI, I do not believe that pure AI material should ever be copyrightable. Not now, after they have been trained on the whole of free knowledge on the internet.  That hands the copyright (and profit) of the original author to the corporation that controls the AI--and that would be a violation of the writer&#39;s original intent. I do believe however that material that has been created interactively by a human with an AI may be copyrighted--by a single author who is human ONLY. That is because it is impossible to know, at this time, where the AI begins and the human steps in. Much of the output I&#39;ve experienced from AI requires extensive editing.  The models will get better, certainly, but even then it will be impossible to parse the AI DNA from the human.  I make innumerable additions, adjustments, edits and changes to text that I have prompted the AI to write (and those prompts are carefully constructed after hours of learning how to &quot;speak&quot; AI.  Frankly, the horse is out of the barn on this.  What you might be able to do at this point is limit LLMs hereafter to learning only from material that they have specific permission to use. To presume that the AIs are copying or plagiarizing is to misunderstand how both language and AIs work.  In some ways, language itself is the original AI--seeking to use phrases learned, altered, tested, reorganized--to communicate.
