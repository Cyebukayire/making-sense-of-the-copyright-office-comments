AI-generated material needs to have a trigger in its program that automatically labels it saying &quot;This material was generated using AI.&quot; That would alert people to the fact it may have copyrighted material within it and should not be regarded as original or copyrightable. <br/><br/>And that would prevent a host of problems, since people would not be able to copyright such work. Since most publications can not accept material where the author doesn&#39;t own the rights, such &quot;authors&quot;  would not get monetary benefit from using AI and passing it off as their own work.
