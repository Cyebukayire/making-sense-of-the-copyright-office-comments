The fact that AI can take an image or a video and change it to look and say, and do whatever it is frightening. People already struggle to know what is true. This is frightening manipulation.<br/><br/>This is harmful to so many parties: the person whose image has been essentially stolen and misused, the people who watch the manipulated image/video, and society in general. There has already been a fostering of distrust of other people, news outlets, businesses, government, etc. This will only foster additional skepticism, division, separation, and ultimately fear and hate.<br/><br/>On a personal note, I don&rsquo;t want my likeness to be stolen unbeknownst to me while I&rsquo;m on a zoom call for example. My likeness can then be manipulated and monetized without my permission. That is truly horrifying, and can only be seen as a personal infringement.<br/><br/>On a professional note, as a professional actor, my likeness is my &ldquo;product&rdquo;. I get paid for my work, and thus my likeness SHOULD be protected under copyright. It should not be able to be stolen and manipulated and monetized by others. I should have complete control over my own likeness.
