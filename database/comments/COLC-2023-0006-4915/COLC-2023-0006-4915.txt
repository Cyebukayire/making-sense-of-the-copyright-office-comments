If ideas and content generated by A.I. tools are always derived from something created by a person, they have no logical stance as being considered at all original. If a person wants to create a derivative work, they are subject to IP rules and regs. There is no soft regulation that could adequately restrict entities from abusing the brain power of A.I. tools to outright steal to &quot;create.&quot; Regulation must restrict these tools to being just tools. Tools are meant to act for us, not replace our own critical thinking. Any use beyond that must be against the law, unless the government wants to allow big business to simply render humanity itself irrelevant.
