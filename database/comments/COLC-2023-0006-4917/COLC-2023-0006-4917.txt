Companies and individuals seeking profit should not be permitted to use AI to generate content or creative work (including, but not limited to, prose, screenplays, music, art, etc.) because it is based on machine learning of existing (i.e. human-made) work and is therefore inherently theft/plagiarism. <br/><br/>Furthermore, AI should not be trained on existing (i.e. human-made) creative works without the explicit consent and compensation of its creators, as doing so without consent and compensation is inherent theft. <br/><br/>It should be noted that generating creative work with AI impedes both creative and social progress, as it repackages past creative work (the vast majority of which is limited to the creative voices of specific and narrow demographics) and reinforces the social norms and biases of the past. Moreover, it actively devalues the creative labor of human beings, whether their work is used to train AI or not.
