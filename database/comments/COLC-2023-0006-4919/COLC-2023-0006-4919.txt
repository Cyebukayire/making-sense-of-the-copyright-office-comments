AI is a destructive tool that is destroying the creative world. Writing, acting, and art are all being hit by its nature.<br/><br/>I understand the idea of ai, but as it is right now, this isn&rsquo;t a good thing nor is it sustainable. Ai &lsquo;artists&rsquo; are stealing real artists works-including artists who have passed away such as Qing Han (qinniart)-and claiming it as their own. Art has always been a tricky thing to copyright, I understand, but there comes a degree where people realise this is theft. Ai doesn&rsquo;t need copyright, artists of all kinds need copyright. There needs to be restrictions on ai art as it is because it&rsquo;s only going to get better and I the theft is only going to get worse.<br/><br/>I have recently seen someone sell ai art as their own work for commissions and have to say, as an artist who is struggling to find a platform and get funds as is, seeing this person outright steal and lie to their audiences and then make a profit is disrespectful and disheartening.<br/><br/>Will I let ai art stop me from making art? Absolutely not. Do I fear ai taking over creative jobs? No since human work will always be valued more. Do I worry for artists rights and protections against theft? Yes. Do I fear that ai will stop future creators from trying? Yes! <br/><br/>Ai needs to regulated and needs to be controlled.
