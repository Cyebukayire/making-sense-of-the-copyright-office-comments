I was a screenwriter for many years. It has always been common for studios to commission scripts from one writer, then hire a long series of subsequent writers to rework, alter, &#39;punch up,&#39; or otherwise rewrite some or all of the script. Like most screenwriters, I have been both original author and rewriter. If AI were used to do those rewrites, it would eliminate a huge percentage of the work in that specific field. I believe it is imperative that our government consider the negative impact AI could have on an entire profession. It&#39;s not important solely for the sake of human authors, but also for the consumers of the work.  Without the diversity of generation after generation of new human authorship, our written culture (which includes words written for the screen) will dwindle into stagnant sameness. AI can only mimic and recombine the thoughts of previous authors. If it proliferates, as many predict, it will gradually parrot itself, to infinity. The incredible creativity of humanity as a whole, in every field of endeavor, could so easily be threatened. I urge caution, robust investigation, and a thoughtful eye to the future. Thank you.
