AI art and writing has been extremely detrimental to creators big and small alike. It stifles the media we put out, and the only party benefitting are the large corporations or lazy individuals using AI to profit off said &ldquo;content&rdquo;. AI is theft because it&rsquo;s sampled multitudes of creative and artistic content from people without their consent, copying and redistributing the hard work and skills people have spent years of their life trying to achieve. Content needs ORGANIC, human hands to work. Every person can bring something new to the table AI can&rsquo;t. Many creative folks have lost their jobs; big and small businesses, because their services were replaced by AI. <br/>AI is meant to do the boring stuff so humans can create. It&rsquo;s a pretty fucked up world we live in where I have to manually file my taxes while AI gets to draw terrible anime women with seven fingers. <br/><br/>AI can be useful for education and tedious programming tasks, computation, calculation, but it has ABSOLUTELY no place in the creative field. It&rsquo;s killing us.
