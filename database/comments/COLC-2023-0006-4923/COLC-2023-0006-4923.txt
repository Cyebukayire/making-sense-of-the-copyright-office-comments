If successful, Generative Ai that uses scraped data from public sources, will kill creativity. All creativity, full stop. Here&rsquo;s why: <br/>1) it will kill incentive for human creativity, since our work will just be harvested and used against our flourishing. People will stop making anything new.<br/>2) Generative Ai does not make anything new for itself. It doesn&rsquo;t really think. It only derives and combines directly from the old.<br/>The combined outcome of these two will be a deterrent to novel solutions to any problem, whether aesthetic or technical. It&rsquo;s a direct threat to our security as a nation.
