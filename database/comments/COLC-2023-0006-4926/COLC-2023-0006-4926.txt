AI-generated content cannot be copyrighted because it is not copyrighted. The fact that they are produced based on works actually created by man is not sufficient to consider them works of intellect, on the contrary, artists whose ideas have been exploited to allow machines to create content should be protected. Scraping any writing, artwork, photos, etc. is a copyright (and ethical) violation.
