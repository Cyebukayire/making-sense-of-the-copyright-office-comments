Most if not all ai data bases are made from scrapeing the internet looking for relevant pictures for their data base without permission from the original source. Ai art is mass theft and the idea that companies are now trying to profit off of it is horrible.<br/>It would also kill a skilled job industry as writers artists musicians etc who make their living off of their craft have spent years if not decades practicing. only now there work is being fed into a machine and told that that machine can do what they do but cheeper.
