In regards to the US Copyright&#39;s inquiry into the laws and ethics of AI generated content, I do not think in good faith I, or any other American, will accept that an Artifical Intelligence somehow has more agency, rights, or ownership of content. AI cannot exist without the work put in by humans, it merely re-arranges it. It can not, and should not, be able to be copyrighted and as a result should be within the public domain.
