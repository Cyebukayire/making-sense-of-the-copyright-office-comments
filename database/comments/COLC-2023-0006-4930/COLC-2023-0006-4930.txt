I don&rsquo;t know a whole lot about how copyrights work, but I do know a little bit about how a lot of ai systems are gathering the data needed to &lsquo;create&rsquo; the content that they do. It is my understanding that many of the ai sources are consuming large quantities of the type of content they are being asked to create and then they are spitting out their own &lsquo;creation&rsquo; that is just a combination of all of those things other&rsquo;s created. They are doing this without the author&rsquo;s permission or giving credit to the original creators. This has already been an issue in most artistic and creative communities for the last few years. It also affects academic integrity by allowing people to use other&rsquo;s findings and having the ai do their work for them, which is plagiarism. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, I&rsquo;m not saying there should be no ai, but there should be a requirement that explicit consent from the original content creators must be given before their content is fed into the ai. Any ai systems that have already fed on other people&rsquo;s content without their explicit permission should have their memory wiped or destroyed or whatever needs to happen so that they can no longer create things based on someone else&rsquo;s work who didn&rsquo;t give permission. This should include academic sources, tv and movies, books, fan works, art, music, clothing production, and anything else that someone has put in the time and effort to create.
