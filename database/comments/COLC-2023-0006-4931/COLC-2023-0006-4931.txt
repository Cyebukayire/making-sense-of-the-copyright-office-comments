I am an actor. Several colleagues have already had their bodies scanned for repetition amongst film projects,  without clear information in whether this is in perpetuity, and without compensation for more than the single day&#39;s work. I have friends who are visual artists who have had their work stolen by AI programs for the creation of generated images in online programs. There needs to be clear and strict regulation on all AI usage when it comes to work, but particularly now in all arts related professions, as this will set the precedent for AI in all fields of life and living.
