AI requires being trained on something. These are existing work, existing art, or existing conversations, there is nothing that AI can say that is important or new, I cannot be used in arts fields, it cannot be used in medical or educational fields. It can&#39;t make anything. There are AI generated books about foraging for edible plants, if even one thing theyve written is incorrect, people could die. AI and the people who set up those programs to train them, do not deserve more protection than the artists that their stuff is trained on. I honestly could not give you ONE useful idea that AI could do for the world or society that isn&#39;t something a person could not do with more knowledge, more safety, and more benefits. Ban AI in any places that it is not purely and obviously recreational. And everywhere else protect the artists whose work is being cut up and repurposed ransom letter style.
