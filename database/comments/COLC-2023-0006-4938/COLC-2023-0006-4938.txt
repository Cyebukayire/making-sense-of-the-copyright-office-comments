As someone who is attempting to work as a writer I&#39;m extremely concerned about the lack of regulation regarding AI. One of the greatest assets a writer has is their voice, and now a large corporation can simply take some of my work, dump it into a machine, and create a facsimile of it. It&#39;s not fair and it&#39;s not right. It puts large corporations at a major advantage and hurts the labor market. And you can&#39;t unring a bell. Once they&#39;ve trained these AIs the damage is done. Regulations around AI and copyright need to be worked out ASAP because every day its delayed gives corporations the chance to engage in the bad behavior they anticipate being banned.
