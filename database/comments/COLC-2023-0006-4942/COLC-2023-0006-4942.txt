I think that the mathematical model created by training on works should be considered a Derivative Work. The model is literally derived from other people&#39;s work. Derivative Works are usually considered things like, a movie based on a book. The movie is a derivative work. An audiobook version of a paperback book is also a derivative work. It is a different creation based upon the labor of someone else. And, generally, one has to buy the right to create a derivative work.<br/><br/>The machine learning models being created are quite literally derived from the labor of someone else. The only difference is that they only have value when they are derived from millions of them instead of just one. It&#39;s like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, having to get the rights to every cartoon character in order to make one movie. <br/><br/>If anything can be owned, it is the *model*, not the creations of the model. But the makers of the model should have to purchase derivative rights from everything they feed into it. That their result is a math equation and not Who Framed Roger Rabbit is their concern and does not change the fact that they are using someone else&#39;s labor for what they think is a valuable goal.
