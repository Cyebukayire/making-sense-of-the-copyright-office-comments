Thank you for opening comments on this issue. As an artist, I find it imperative that artistic works and pieces be protected against AI generative software. AI software trains its programs on existing work, and most often that work is by us artists, who neither know of or consent to our pieces being used. I&#39;ve seen artists distraught and frantic over their hard work being used for a simple prompt, the hours and skill put into a piece stolen. It&#39;s upsetting for all creatives out there to think that something they made could be taken without their permission. Plain and simply, that&#39;s an infringement of copyright. An artist owns that work, and without their permission nobody can steal it. Yet, AI generative software is. Please listen to the artists, and not the representatives of these AI software, because it is our works who make these programs possible, and we do not want to be associated with them any longer. We never have. Thank you once more for opening questions, and thank you for taking the time to consider my comment.
