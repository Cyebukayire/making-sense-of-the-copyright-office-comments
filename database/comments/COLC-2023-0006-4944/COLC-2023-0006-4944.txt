&quot;AI&quot; in its current form (which does not actually constitute artificial intelligence) is a tool for plagiarizing the works of others; it&#39;s explicitly dependent on being trained on a large volume of work and it then outputs material based on that work. It is not simply a tool that an artist or a writer may use, it is a tool that a non-artist or non-writer may try to use to bypass the process of fairly compensating the people on whose work the &quot;AI&quot; model was based. It is the output of an algorithm, no more copyrightable than digits of &pi; spat out by a computer calculation are copyrightable; changing the section of &pi; from which the digits are printed doesn&#39;t constitute sufficient human input to make that section of &pi; copyrightable, and changing the inputs to an &quot;AI&quot; algorithm to make it display a different shuffling of plagiarized works doesn&#39;t make the &quot;AI&quot; output copyrightable.
