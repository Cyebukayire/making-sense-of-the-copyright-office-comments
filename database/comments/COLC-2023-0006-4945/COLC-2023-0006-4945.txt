Abolish all copyright, starting from patents. No human has the right to &quot;own&quot; an idea or legally restrict its expression and innovation in the mind and hands of another. The buying, selling, and leasing of ideas to those who can afford them is a disgusting practice that has cost millions of lives at worst (see pharmaceutical patents, most recently the trademarked COVID-19 vaccines) and stifles creativity at best. Destroy this system now.
