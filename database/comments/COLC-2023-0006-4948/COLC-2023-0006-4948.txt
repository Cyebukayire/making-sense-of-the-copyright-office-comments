I don&#39;t believe that AI should be copyrightable. From the perspective of a digital artist, it does not seem to fall under fair use. In it&#39;s current state, it threatens the lively hood of artists by using their work without permission for financial gain. If a piece of software is copying the work of another artist and producing identical results then they are stealing and could resell that work. Not only that, but it threatens the lively hood of that artist by destroying their market niche at almost no effort for the one who clicked &quot;run&quot; on their program. It is the same amount of effort to copy and paste and reupload as it is to run that AI program. They are tantamount to the same thing.
