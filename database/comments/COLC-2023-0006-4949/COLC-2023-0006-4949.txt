Artificial intelligence and machine learning have many valid uses, however the current climate allows too many companies to abuse these tools and erode trust with the general public. The ethical complications already yet to be resolved around how AI was trained need to be fixed before we can move forward. When we continue to learn that companies use things like private medical photographs obtained illegally to train their programs, with no consent or compensation to the people who have had their likeness stolen, how can they anyone be awarded a copy write on anything trained by that program? People who have been victimized and traumatized by having their likeness used without permission, and with no compensation should have a voice in the matter, too. AI should not be protected at all under copywrite. It is unethical and already people have proven they can not be trusted with it. <br/>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artist-finds-private-medical-record-photos-in-popular-ai-training-data-set/<br/>https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/facial-recognition-s-dirty-little-secret-millions-online-photos-scraped-n981921
