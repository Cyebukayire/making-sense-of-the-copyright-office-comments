I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in this topic and its request for public feedback. I am both an artist whose work appears on various art-sharing platforms, who has full intention to make a living off my works - once I am able to set up the necessary cornerstones - and an avid supporter of other authors and artists. <br/><br/>There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.&nbsp; While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.&nbsp;<br/> To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies. <br/><br/>Furthermore, while I think there are potentially useful applications of learned language model text and model-generated artwork, I think the current models built on unethically sourced content, in clear violation of the copyrights held by the original creators of the works, is what destroys any utility these models might have had. Until models are ethically built, and the use of them a required disclosure (for example, articles must say &quot;llms have been used to generate part or all of this text&quot;), and the acknowledgement made that these model-generated creations are not art, cannot be copyrighted as art, and have no place being treated as a replacement for art (but rather as a supplement), there&#39;s no way llms and art generators can be allowed to grow. It&#39;s my opinion that the current existing models need to be destroyed, and replaced by models built using ethically sourced datasets. <br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training. I will reiterate that I also believe all current models that have been trained on artworks that are under copyright protection should be dismantled and replaced - if rebuilt at all - with models trained on works that have clear consent from the original authors/artists for their works to be used in AI training, and that these artists/authors should be compensated for their contributions. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.
