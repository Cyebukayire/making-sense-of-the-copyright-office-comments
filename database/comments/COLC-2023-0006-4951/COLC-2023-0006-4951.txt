Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment. I&rsquo;m a student in pursuit of a career in the arts in my future. I currently share my art online to create a portfolio for my future career. If that portfolio had been used to train an AI without my knowledge or consent, I would feel extremely violated. With AI already threatening the livelihoods of several career paths, it leaves me scared about my own future in art. There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.&nbsp; While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.&nbsp; To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies. The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act. Thank you for considering the opinion of the people on this important matter.
