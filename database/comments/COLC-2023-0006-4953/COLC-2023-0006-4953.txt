Hello, I am just an art hobbyist and I am concerned with unregulated A//I because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.  This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. Unregulated A//I is a threat because...<br/><br/>We have yet to see any physical evidece that states said A//I and can draw, voice, music, by original sources.  We need a physical representation on the process of A//I and have seen none.<br/>Many people, CEO and techs, Ellon Musk have not once proven that A//I improves daily life or benefits the user.  They are lying.<br/>We have reason to believe A//I is lie, becuase we have nothing to show or prove it isn&#39;t.  We as a whole do not posses such a technology that can make A//I<br/>Everyone&#39;s work from art, music and their own voices have pointed out and stated they recieved NO permission or residuals from A//I <br/>There does not a exist an A//I that can draw, write, talk, or create without some form of human input.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.  Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.  Artsits will be credited, and are sourced from said A//I and that should be possible since we know A//I is generating and mapping pre-existing images online, this also applies to music, writing and VAs.  I would like to see A//I used by everyone in fair use, with consent, and with trust that my content will tell a complete stranger that my work came from a human being.
