Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is dangerously unregulated. Despite its image as an advancement of technology, it is now largely being used as a replacement for fulfilling the hopes and dreams of many Americans. Not only am I talking about artists, but anyone who has ever believed that our lives would be made easier by computers. What kind of future do you call it where the computers are making art and music, while the humans are sitting in an office doing paperwork, or dealing with people behind a counter? Instead of the promising space age we believed in, our world is turning into a dystopia where we have to worry about what technologies are in our home, listening to us. Or in this case, which ones are trying to be a cheap copy of the human spirit.<br/>I belive the recent laws passed limiting copyright towards AI generated imagery is a step in the right direction, and I hope we can continue to regulate the technology for the long-running sake of humanity.
