Hello. I greatly appreciate that you are looking for the public&rsquo;s opinion on this matter. <br/><br/>I am a student in a district that spends most of its time on the internet for school work, and have heard multiple lectures about not using ai, where many of my classmates admitted to using it. Not only does it make cheating easy for students, but it&rsquo;s also extremely dangerous. As AI has trouble finding true information, it can easily spread misinformation. I recently saw a post talking about the possibilities of ai writing a foraging book without incorrect plant information. To make matters even worse, many authors and artists have come forward as having their work inputed in ai databases without their consent, often times leading to the machine spitting out an only slightly altered version with no credit given. This is unacceptable and needs to stop. I&rsquo;ve even read stories of voice actors having their voice manipulated with ai to say things they never said; if this is legal, many Americans could be out of jobs.<br/><br/> As a minor, I live in fear of what opportunities technology will take from me and my peers by the time I&rsquo;m looking to enter the job market. Please consider lessening this fear by passing legislation to protect authors and artists works and actors voices. Thank you for your time.
