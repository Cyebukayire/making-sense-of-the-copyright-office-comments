If we permit educators to teach students using existing information, it stands to reason that AIs should also be trained on this data to maximize their effectiveness. Derivative works based on AI-generated content should be placed in the public domain, as they result from the aggregation of collective human knowledge. Living individuals should have their likeness protected and be compensated for its use for a reasonable time after their death.AI-generated works must be explicitly labeled and possibly fingerprinted to ensure clarity of origin. Responsibility for actions based on AI-generated advice should lie with the end-user, provided that the AI origin is clearly disclosed, enabling informed decisions. AIs should be permitted to create in the styles of deceased persons after a reasonable time, with the understanding that such works become public domain. For example, an AI could produce an &quot;Elvis&quot; song that&#39;s freely shareable, but any AI-created Taylor Swift song must involve payment to Swift and be clearly labeled as AI-generated.As for job automation, selectively choosing what an AI can and cannot learn could lead to unfair job protection for certain sectors. It&#39;s unjust to protect musicians and writers from automation while leaving fields like mathematics and programming vulnerable. Automation should be an equal opportunity disruptor.<br/>
