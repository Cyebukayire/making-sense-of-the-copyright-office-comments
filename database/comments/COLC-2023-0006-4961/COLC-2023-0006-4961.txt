AI is a terrible tool. Even in it&#39;s infancy, the prevelance of plagarisim and misinformation and theft is already causing significant damage to jobs, art, and the law. Allowing AI to develop and spread without great regulation will allow corporations to steal from people who workd hard to creat compelling works of literature, film, and art. They will be able to steal the very heart of humanity, our creativity. Stop them now before they do more damage.
