First, I would like to thank the Copyright Office for opening up this discussion for public comment. I am a hobby artist and an aspiring writer, and a supporter of more talented career artists. I have been following the discussion of generative AI art through the news and through the conversations of friends who are directly affected by AI-generated content. As copyright law exists now, authors are allowed exclusive use of their artwork throughout their lifetime and a few decades by default. Only after a certain period of time has passed, may the public use direct copies of their work that aren&#39;t protected under transformative or parody clauses. <br/><br/>However, over the past year we have seen many cases of generative AI images being trained on the data of artists who have not been informed or paid for the use of their work, violating the artist&#39;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies. These artists are not silent either- when it comes to defending their copyright, they take every avenue to remove their work from the training datasets that used them without permission. However, these avenues do not always succeed due to the incompetence or ignorance of the people who create the models. These artists need the aid of the law to prevent their copyrighted work from being used without permission for the monetary gain of others. <br/><br/>To aid these artists and to further promote the arts in the United States, the Copyright Office should adopt the position that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works, when it is done without the explicit permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>Thank you again for your time and consideration; it means a great deal to all of us who love the arts.
