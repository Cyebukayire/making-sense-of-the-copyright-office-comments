Artificial Intelligence, or AI cannot truly &lsquo;create&rsquo; anything. It can only regurgitate whatever art or writing it has &lsquo;consumed&rsquo; at the direction of its creators. That art or writing was created by human beings and directing the AI to consume this art or writing WITHOUT PERMISSION from the human creators essentially steals that work from them. Whether it&rsquo;s recognizable in the AI&rsquo;s final product doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is that AI cannot create anything original. What they create are poor imitations of human creations and should therefore NOT take the place of human creators because NOTHING can replace that.
