What we currently call &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is not even intelligent. It uses stolen human-made information, data, and art without crediting the real people who contributed to those sources. This is not the same as an intelligent being with their own experiences taking inspiration from someone else&#39;s art, as the &quot;AI&quot; does not have its own individual perspective. Training AI on copyrighted works is essentially just training them to do  copyright infringement.
