It would be preferable to put a stop to folks abusing language models to create forgeries of others&#39; art. Writing, voicing, drawings, music, all of it. Language models should be used to assist people with understanding the world, not steal from others. <br/><br/>Let&#39;s work together and put the pencils back in the hands of the human artists. Completely ban the creation of language model &#39;art&#39; by use of other&#39;s creations. If they want to create an art language model, they have to supply ALL of their own data and make it very clear both where the data came from, and how their language model works.
