Hello, <br/><br/>I am an artist who works as an illustrator and works in animation. Here are some answers to some of the general questions.<br/><br/>1.  I did not ask for my art to be used like I also do not want my art to be used in things I disagree with ethically and morally and to know I have no say what AI can use my art in ways i do not agree with without my permission upsets me greatly. <br/><br/>2. I have known others who were able to make a living as being artists but after the AI became more widespread they no longer can afford to be artists. Why pay an artist when people can type their name in a prompt and get it for free or a fraction of the price. These AI programs were trained on copyrighted material or those artists I mentioned. Artists had no say in their art being trained from and even when their art has been used to create something without their permission they will never see a single cent go towards them only to the AI creators. Artists should be opted OUT by default not in.
