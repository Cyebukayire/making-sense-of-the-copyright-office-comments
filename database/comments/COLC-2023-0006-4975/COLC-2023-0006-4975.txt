I am absolutely against AI, individuals, or companies using my content without explicit &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo; consent. It disturbs me greatly that not only can companies scrape my artwork and use it, but might take my photos or photos of my family members and use them to generate digital &ldquo;extras,&rdquo; to be used in ads, films, or any other content. A friend of mine recently showed me an ad he received in his inbox with a photo that looked eerily like his son. If this is the future I don&rsquo;t want any part of it. It is a fundamentally different issue to &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; since it can be used on such a larger scale than an individual creating a single collage or mixtape. Companies should be forced to use only content in the public domain to train AI. I&rsquo;m afraid the damage may already be done though. Please find a way to protect artists and individuals from further harm.
