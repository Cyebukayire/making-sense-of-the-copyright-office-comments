Copyrighting visual, aubible, and text media generated by &quot;AI&quot; (there is nothing intelligent about this technology at this point) implies that non-sentient, non-sapient software has rights. This is patently ridiculous. Anyone who has had a social media post about a cartoon child&#39;s birthday flagged by an algorithm as Not Safe For Work, or looked up citations offered by AI instructed to produce an academic paper, or tried to use an AI-generated foraging guide knows that these machines are not viewing the world in any conscious or reality-based way. The fact that these programs are trained by scraping copyrighted works without permission, and that the companies using this software are attempting to force creative workers to turn over rights to their work, voices, and appearances to be used without further recompense in perpetuity, also reveals a basic disrespect for the copyright process incompatible with any expectation of AI being used responsibly or ethically.
