I support treating AI usage of works for training purpose in similar ways to how we treat human usage of works.  Training off of a book or a piece of visual art is like being inspired by a book or a piece of visual art, and should be allowed.  Outright plagiarism is another matter, but it should also be relatively rare with current AI systems, and so we shouldn&#39;t allow plagiarism concerns to prevent us from allowing training.
