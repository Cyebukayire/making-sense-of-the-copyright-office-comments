AI is theft. As it is a learning based tool people must feed it content to learn from: ex: taking images/writings from their favorite creators to produce something in it&#39;s likeness. This is done without regard to an artists consent and is a theft of years of working on skills/crafts to recreate their own lifeless version without any real work. These works are the passed on as original content that can be used for profit. It is exploitative and is taking money directly from the artists. <br/>AI is a tool to replace people they don&#39;t want to pay/ such as companies using AI to provide them movie scripts or logo designs or art at low cost to them - using the humans&#39;s work to rob the artists of their jobs. Stealing their work to steal their jobs. <br/>It&#39;s an excuse to pay human beings less and it is theft. Using AI to scrape fiction websites or books or art portfolios is an infringement on the artists rights. They are ripping off artists works without paying them. It&#39;s a labor violation, it&#39;s a copyright infringement, and it is a disrespect to the human artistic spirit. People should be able to post their work online without worry that people are feeding it into their AI to steal their work. We demand regulations and AI must be slowed down - it is an imperfect tool that was created by people with their own implicit racial/age/class/etc biases. AI is a tool that police have been using to arrest people based on faulty facial recognition technology that is tearing apart families, destroying job markets, and killing people. It needs to be regulated - especially in the policing sector where police can use faulty racially motived AI information (such as pointing out darker skin people as more dangerous based on the AI creators own bias.) It is an imperfect tool and a dangerous one. Protect the American people.
