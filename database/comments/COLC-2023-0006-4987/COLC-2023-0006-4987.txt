Companies should not be able to utilize Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)to obtain personal information, ideas, and other forms of data. My biggest concern as an individual is my ideas, my creative projects, ect. are being scanned in order to produce projects and products with no human interaction and also that aren&rsquo;t copyrighted. Especially in situations like Google Docs, Microsoft Word, etc. where my information is stored under the assumption that it is still my own and not being scanned and replicated elsewhere. I would prefer regulations on A.I. in the form of where companies obtain the data to feed a.I. formulas. I also think A. I. Projects of writing and art shouldn&rsquo;t be submitted for monetary gain.
