AI technology, as it currently stands, is highly unethical and threatening to countless artists. Training AI technology on art without the creators consent should be illegal, in my opinion. It is a danger to the rights and livelihood of visual artists, writers, and creative people. These artists receive no compensation or credit for the style that these programs steal and imitate. It seems that businesses such as film studios want to use AI technology to make some artists obsolete and replace them. This is not only concerning and unethical, but completely antithetical to creating art in the first place. Algorithmically trained  AI content is just plagiarism. For the sake of artists everywhere, we demand a removal of art scraped without the creator&#39;s consent and strict laws against doing so in the future.
