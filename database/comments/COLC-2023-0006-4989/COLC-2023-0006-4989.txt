I am a Costumer for film and television. AI causes an majorl in threat for the future of my career. Currently individual customers are needed to dress, and procure costumes for every person on camera. With the advent of AI, these people on camera will be computer generated. That eliminates the need for so many jobs of people in my position. I have been doing this for 20 years. This is the first time I felt like my way of life could completely go away.  This will hurt the American economy!
