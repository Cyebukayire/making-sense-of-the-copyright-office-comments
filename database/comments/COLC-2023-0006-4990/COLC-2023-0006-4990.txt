One of the issues I have seen recently about generative AI is that many AI programs have been trained on copyrighted material, sometimes without having disclosed that fact. I don&#39;t think this should be allowed. The people who made the original material were not compensated for the use of their words or images, and yet the AI is reproducing words or images that are directly based on those copyrighted works. The AI program is not a person and it does not add, in my opinion, transformative value when creating output. This problem could be solved by training AI on public domain material and/or commissioning artists or writers to create works that will be used to train AI with the full knowledge of the creators. It is important to have ethical datasets if we are going to use generative AI for creative purposes. Otherwise, these program negatively affect artists and writers by copying their work without compensation and could reduce creators&#39; income by providing an unethical alternative to commission.
