I am an amateur artist. I believe that art that an AI creates can not be considered original if the AI was trained with other people&rsquo;s work. If all people&rsquo;s whose work went into training the AI got proper credit, I would not be so concerned. However, often artworks are used to train AI without the artist&rsquo;s permission or knowledge, and no credit is given to the individual artists.
