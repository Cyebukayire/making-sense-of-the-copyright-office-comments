Neural networks are a tool. Perhaps one day, some version of this tool may be able to be utilized in a capacity that is safe for copyright. But as they are now? They are a toy that scrambles the works of others to create semi coherent collages. What they create are not wholly new entities unto themselves. They create collages, a scrapbook full of works owned by others, most of which was obtained illegally. AI is a marketing term, not an accurate description. What we have today is possibly the great great great grandparent of something that may be able to do something on its own. But what we have today is a tool that cannot create copyright-able content by any stretch of the imagination.
