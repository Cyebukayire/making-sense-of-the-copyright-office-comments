AI creations should not and cannot be copywrited by anyone. A computer is not a living being, therefore cannot own content it creates. A person or a corporation cannot claim ownership of something they did not create. Anything produced by AI should be considered  and IS public domain, as no person or corporation has a right to claim it as their own.
