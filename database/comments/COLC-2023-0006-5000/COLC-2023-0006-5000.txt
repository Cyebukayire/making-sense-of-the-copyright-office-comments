If I write a college essay, and do not properly cite my sources, I will fail. If I record a song that samples other people&rsquo;s music, and I do not compensate them fairly for its use, I will be sued. AI does not create, it steals. It&rsquo;s vulture capitalism, stealing from people who did the hard work. <br/><br/>People should have to Opt In, not Opt out, for AI training; and even then, they should be cited and compensated appropriately. Any work &ldquo;written&rdquo; or &ldquo;created&rdquo; by AI, should be clearly credited as such (e.g. &ldquo;This book was written using AI&rdquo;) and should not be allowed copyright protections. This is the only way to protect the integrity of hard working artists and creatives.<br/><br/>Human art is important. It takes talent and years of effort to succeed, and even then, there&rsquo;s no guarantee. It&rsquo;s disgusting to minimize that so people can rip others off. This needs to stop now! All the data sets must be scrubbed and a fair pathway forward must be reached.
