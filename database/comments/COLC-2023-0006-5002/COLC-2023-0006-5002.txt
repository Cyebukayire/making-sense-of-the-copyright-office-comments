I have very strong concerns about AI and its implications for creative and intellectual works. As it stands currently AI is able to replecate style and content of individuals without requiring their permission or even their knowledge. I believe without heavy regulation Artificial Intelligence has the potential to make intellectual property theft run rampant. I attatched an image comparing an AI generated image next to the painting it was replicating. This is an example of a well known painting, but when AI is used to replicate art created by lesser known artists it becomes much more difficult to discern if a piece of art was stolen or not. As a matter of fact, all AI generated images use already existing art for reference, and I believe that one could make the argument that all AI art infringes on the rights of Intellectual Property holders. <br/><br/>The solution could be a restriction on what AI is able to use as reference, requiring the developers of the AI generation program reach out to artists and writers to get permission before their program can use their art or writing as reference. Or it could be a requirement that all works created with AI must be labeled as such, and those whose art or writing was used as reference by the AI must be credited. Either way, AI needs regulation and restriction. If left to run rampant copywright laws may not be able to keep up.
