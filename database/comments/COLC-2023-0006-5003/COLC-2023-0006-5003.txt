Artificial intelligence is a powerful and wonderful invention - but it must be applied for the right reasons. Any artistic application of Artificial Intelligence will not be done to further cultural progress, it&#39;ll be done to cut costs and manufacture generic, soulless mountains of content on which corporations can pump out more and more merchandising opportunities to profit off of useless knickknacks. Applied in the science and technology sectors, it could be incredibly useful, but the only thing that will happen if you allow copyrights to be had on AI generated images is you&#39;ll get a flood of people trying to monetize things fast and easy, and it&#39;ll put millions of hardworking artists out of work. Please don&#39;t allow copyright on AI art, music, or writing! You made the right decision before!
