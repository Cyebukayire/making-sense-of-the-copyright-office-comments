AI is plagiarism software. Author after author has come forward to state their work has been stolen without their permission. Content writers, creators, even businesses have stated they are finding their content used by others, even their competition is getting to use things they wrote and then claim it was an AI program, so they aren&#39;t to blame... this cannot stand. We are losing work to programs that are taking our work and selling it to others without our consent or permission. Businesses cannot keep losing money and losing their property they paid people to make or made themselves.
