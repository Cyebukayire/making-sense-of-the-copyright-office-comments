I feel very strongly that the way AI is being used to illegally &quot;scrape&quot; millions of pieces of creative work, from visual arts, to audio to writing must be regulated. The original artists and their work must be protected. The companies who have already built vast libraries of stolen materials should be fined in such a way as to make it clear that their behavior is not acceptable. We must not let the corporations crush artists by stealing their work and attempting to make them redundant by reproducing their art.
