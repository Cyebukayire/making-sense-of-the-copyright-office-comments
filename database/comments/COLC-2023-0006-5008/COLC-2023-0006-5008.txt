What &ldquo;AI&rdquo; does involves no actual intelligence, it&rsquo;s only theft. By no means should it be allowed for the actual art and writing of real human beings to be stolen and repurposed for the profit of random grifters. Apart from being an insult to art it&rsquo;s done without the permission of artists and writers.
