ai doesn&rsquo;t create anything of its own. It just uses other artwork, with or without (usually WITHOUT) the author&rsquo;s consent, and mashes it together. I don&rsquo;t consider myself an artist, but I do care about artists because without their unique creativity the word would be very boring. I mean all types of artists too! Book covers, tv shows, voice actors, and many more! The ai versions I have seen of different types of art don&rsquo;t feel like they have the same amount of care as the real thing.
