Any piece of art (all forms from Audio to Video to Written to 3D -- really, anything that can be seen and / or heard) that is created exclusively with AI tools should NOT be eligible for any copyright protection. Any piece of art (as defined above) that utilizes AI tools in creating some part of that artwork should only receive copyright protection if the AI tool was simply an enhancement tool (such as a filter to clean up audio or visual material).<br/>Just because someone prompts an AI tool to &quot;create&quot; an image or a phrase or anything does not mean that the created thing meets any copyright protection threshold simply because the human making the prompt does not &quot;create&quot; the thing. I can tell someone to make a painting about a house with a blue tree in the garden yet I can not claim copyright to the painting that the then person creates.<br/>A machine is not human and therefore has no &quot;right&quot; to any protection under any law, and especially not copyright law simply because American law is fundamentally and totally based upon our God-given human rights as recognized in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S.A.&#39;s Constitution and Bill of Rights. Machines, computers, and software (AI is software) are not human.
