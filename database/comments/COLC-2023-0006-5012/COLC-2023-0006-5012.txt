I am a film and TV screenwriter and studios have indicate they are using AI to make the process more &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;modern.&quot; This aim effectively means that AI can be used to generate a first draft and a smaller number of writers might be hired subsequently at greatly reduced costs. Generative AI is plagiarism, so it&#39;s not clear how AI-generated/ assisted writing can be copyrighted, notwithstanding that any original work must be created by a natural person(s) to claim copyright. This poses a unique legal dilemma in terms of who is the creator/ author of an artistic work. <br/><br/>I strongly urge you to tightly regulate the use of AI rather than waiting to act in damage control mode as is the case in social media and mis/disinformation.
