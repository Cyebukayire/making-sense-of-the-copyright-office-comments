Written AI generated content clearly draws direct phrases from content that is fed into it. As an obvious source of potential plagiarism both accidental and intentional, ai models should not be legally allowed to draw from unconsenting sources. <br/>AI art threatens the market for human artists in much the same way that knock-offs threaten to replace the market for legitimate goods. In the same way that a knockoff of a brand good is copyright infringement, ai generated art that has trained from an artist in order to copy their style should be considered copyright infringement. <br/>I am also deeply troubled by the potential for impersonation and false evidence from AI generated video and voice imitations, though I am not sure how to address that issue.
