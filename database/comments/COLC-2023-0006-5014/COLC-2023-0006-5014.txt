The current marketplace of generative AI (GAI) is still tucked behind an iron curtain. Without a full disclosure from the large technology platform that scraped and then used that content to build their considerable GAI engines: The owners of that content, much of it unquestionably protected under both a copyright and a Creative Commons license, will never be consulted as to whether or not companies like Google and Microsoft have permission to use that work for their own profit.<br/><br/>Not only should GAI never be protected by the benefit of a copyright, under the current scheme, it shouldn&#39;t be sold, either. It&#39;s one thing for Google to scrape a site so that a potential audience can find that content by way of search. It&#39;s another for Google (or Microsoft, Meta, et al) to use that content without permission or disclosure for their own profits. <br/><br/>GAI platforms should be forced to disclose the source of its considerable data troves, the process by which it stores and then repurposes that content, and then, finally, whether or not it owns the copyrights for any of that material. If (similarly to Adobe) they hire internal talent to generate proprietary images and content, or otherwise licenses that content: Then perhaps, and only then, can a copyright be justified for any of the content generated within that platform. <br/><br/>Getty Images, for example, licenses copyright-protected images to users for a fee, but maintains the copyright for those images. Even when (and I do, often) purchase a license for commerical use, I&#39;m limited as to the scope of how I may do so. This of course is copyright 101.<br/>There&#39;s no reason to allow large companies to avoid the normal route of licensure and commercial sale of content, despite the fact that they have done so for years. If my clients (for whom I write considerable volumes of content) ELECT to allow a crawler to suck their IP into a large LLM? Then that should be a process that they opt into. The current system plainly allows the resale of owned content. Under no circumstances should this become the status quo.<br/><br/>
