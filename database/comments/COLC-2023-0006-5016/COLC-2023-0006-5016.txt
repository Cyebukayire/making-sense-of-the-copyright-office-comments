Thank you for opening this issue up to the public and for giving us a voice on it. I strongly support the protection of all creatives and their works, and believe that to allow artificial intelligence to train off of these without permission or compensation would be legally and morally wrong. Now is the time to strengthen protections for all works, when they are most vulnerable to theft and forgery with very few actions to take for themselves.
