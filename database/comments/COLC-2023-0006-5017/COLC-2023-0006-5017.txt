AI applications like ChatGPT use publicly available information on the internet to fill their database without regard to the author/creator&#39;s choice to have their work be used by the application or not. No regard is paid to copyrights, notifying the author/creator of the use of their work, paying the author/creator for the use of their work, or asking permission to use their work. This is theft of the author/creator&#39;s work and should be punished as any other criminal act is. The applications also do not tell their users the sources of the product they are providing to their users making the users complicit with their theft and giving them no choice as to what types of sources they wish to use. A user might have wished to use only sources in the public domain. The applications often provide erroneous results to the users without any notification that the product they are providing is basically junk. The companies that provide these applications are basically abusing, defrauding, and stealing from both the creators of the material they steal and the users of the product. These applications also deny the users choice. A normal search engine provides websites the user can visit to get the information they request. The user knows where the information comes from, who created it, if it is copyrighted or not, and can make a choice of the information they want to use or not. These applications take that choice from the user and leave them blind as to what the source of their product is and who created it, and what the validity of it may be. They are a prescription for ignorance, stupidity, and criminal activity.
