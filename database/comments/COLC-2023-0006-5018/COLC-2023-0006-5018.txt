I will start by saying that I understand the appeal for AI generated art. It is a tool companies and entrepreneurial individuals use to get ahead with minimal cost, making it the capitalist&rsquo;s dream. Yet the eagerness to draw from the well of generative content for monetary gain ignores the moral deficit it causes.<br/><br/>AI generated art/writing is created from already existing material to recreate a facsimile of the original work. There is no thought, no process, no ART to the making of it. An original work is made less by this process, diluting the qualities that make it special. But the worst part is the lack of consent. A creator may pour their heart and soul into what they make, only to have someone steal elements of their effort on a process that lacks that same human touch. And it is stealing, as no one has granted consent to have their work used in such a way. If I were to find someone&rsquo;s art online and post it for sale as my own, the original creator would have every right to sue me for that. Having a program that takes that art and runs it through an algorithm, then have someone pass it off as an &ldquo;inspired by&rdquo; work, is no different.<br/><br/>The world needs art and content that is developed with a human soul and effort. Therefore, copyright should not be extended to any work made using AI generative tools. Anyone who raises the issue that such a decision infringes on their ability to compete should take the time, effort, and dedication that original creators have to hone their abilities and learn to produce their own works if copyright is essential to their success.
