If we lived in a society where artists could meet their needs without selling their art, where they were just doing art as a hobby or passion, then AI would just be another tool. People could goof around with it, use it to explore new ways to make art, or anything else. That&#39;s not what we have though. I&#39;ve followed many artists on social media sites and they&#39;re almost universally concerned about the rise of AI art, being trained on the work of traditional artists without consent or compensation, and how the rise of AI art is damaging and will continue to damage their livelihoods. Unless you&#39;re prepared to create a society where artists can meet their needs without selling their art, then AI art needs to have serious limitations.
