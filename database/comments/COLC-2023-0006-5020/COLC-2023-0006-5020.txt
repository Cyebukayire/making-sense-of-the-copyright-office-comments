People work hard on the things they create, I&#39;m a painter not a writer but many of my friends are and it&#39;s heartbreaking to see their stuff get scraped by ai so others can put in no effort at all and make money or a name for themselves off of it. Art is a fundamental part of the human experience and I believe that the use of ai hinders that, an ai doesn&#39;t have life experience it doesn&#39;t have a personal story to tell and those are fundamental parts to being able to create something. All ai does is take work from other people put it in a blender and serve it up like that. They can&#39;t add anything just change what other people have made
