AI generated material should not be copyright eligible. This material only exists because it is taking pre-existing works fed into it&#39;s system and remixing them. AI is unable to mimic the human ability to conjure and create, it can only cut / paste within the bounds of its programming. It lacks the cognitive ability to think creatively and make something new.
