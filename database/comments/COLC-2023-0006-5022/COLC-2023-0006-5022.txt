AI is a tool, a tool that can be used for creation, collaboration, and innovation as well.<br/><br/>If Photoshop is a creative tool, and you use content-aware fill (which uses AI), does that mean you have no copyright rights to your work?<br/><br/>I understand the hesitations on AI creations and allowing people to copyright their creations, but how do you regulate that?<br/><br/>If I started with AI to create a base art, and then added on top with something else, could I not copyright that? <br/><br/>There are going to be a lot of voices speaking against, but I am one for the future of AI and how we can use it as a tool to improve our lives and enhance our work.
