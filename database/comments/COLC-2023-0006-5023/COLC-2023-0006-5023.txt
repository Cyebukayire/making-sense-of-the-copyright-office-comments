I think it still takes creativity to use AI. The images created are never exactly the same as an some artist&#39;s works that Ai might be making variations of. It would be a great thing for AI artists to be able to copyright thier works as it still takes creativity to use AI and know how to use it to create AI images. Ai is just a tool to create art like an artist using a paint brush to paint. It&#39;s just a little more advanced. I create amazing dresses with AI and I&#39;ve never seen anything like them anywhere else, they are 100% unique and it pains me that I can&#39;t copyright any of the fashion images I&#39;ve created. It&#39;s heart breaking. I have a good eye and I know what colours to use just as if I would design in without the use of AI but AI is easier for me to use. It&#39;s so annoying that I could have made a career for myself in the fashion industry with AI but can&#39;t do anything with the images I&#39;ve created.
