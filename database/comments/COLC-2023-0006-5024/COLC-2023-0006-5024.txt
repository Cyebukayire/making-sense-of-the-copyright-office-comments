I am an Artist. A Writer. If not regulated, AI will impact what I love and how I make money to provide for my family. Art, music, writing, poetry, filmmaking, social media, journalism, advertising, blogging, web video production, voiceover work, and many more creative industries will be - and are being - impacted by the unregulated use of AI to replace Human creation. The rapid insertion of Artificial Intelligence into our lives has often been compared to the Calculator. A phrase often used is, &quot;It&#39;s just a tool.&quot;. But this is a fallacy. A selfish fallacy often used by organizations and companies who profit, or will profit, from AI. The calculator, to stay with this example, does not scrape the internet to steal its answers from mathematicians. But this is precisely what AI does. It does not create original work. It scours the web in milliseconds and steals from Human creators. I strongly support federal regulation of AI and hope the US Copyright Office will consider the downstream implications to US citizens and beyond. Jobs will be lost. Lives will be affected. Industries and economies large and small will suffer. They already are. AI is not Artificial Intelligence. It is Articifial Imitation. And what it imitates belongs to Humans - and is protected by copyrights. Please help protect us.
