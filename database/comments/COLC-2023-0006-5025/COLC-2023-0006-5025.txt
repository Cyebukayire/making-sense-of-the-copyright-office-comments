Dear U.S. copy right office,<br/><br/>I am an author that has put stories out on the internet and is looking to make a living as a writer. I am opposed to A.I. companies having free reign to steal and butcher peoples artwork and stories that they put actual blood sweat and tears into. Please, propose a full ban on A.I. and A.I. companies using copyrighted art.<br/><br/>Thank you
