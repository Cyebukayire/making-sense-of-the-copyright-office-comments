I honestly think that being able to copyright AI-created things isn&#39;t right, because AI is made through taking things that other people have made and combining it into something that kinda falls apart the more you look at it. I mean, every AI art thing I&#39;ve seen looks awful up close. People should not be able to copyright things like that.
