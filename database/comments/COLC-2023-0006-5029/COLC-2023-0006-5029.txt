AI has no right to copyright or to use copyrighted materials, including the work non-corporate entities that include small artists and/or freelancers. Because AI cannot inherently be creative (it has to &quot;scrape&quot; other works to learn to mimic them), any materials produced by an AI model should be made public domain and otherwise not qualify for copyright protections. Furthermore, any artists who&#39;s works have been scraped should be notified and compensated before their works are used in any capacity.
