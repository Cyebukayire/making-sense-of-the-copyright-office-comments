Do not let AI be trained from copyrighted, human, works and do not let any form of AI generated material be allowed for copyright protection.<br/><br/>Allowing companies to use copyrighted works to train their AI tools is extraordinarily dangerous to American creativity, economic progress, and the safety of current and future copyright. Even with paid compensation for the use of copyrighted works to the holder or creator to train these tools will all works created from said programs to produce on mass and at a scale which would significantly devalue the original, human produced, copyrighted work. Additionally, the incentive to produce original, human crafted, work would be reduced as allowing companies and programs to produce content without any or limited human intervention/input would limit or eliminate the need to produce original content. Human creativity, and the ability to capitalize off one&rsquo;s own talents and works would become extremely difficult as cheaper works would be legally available off of previously copyrighted works. Also, the open access of AI tools has allowed the prolific increase in AI generated or assisted scams, extortion, blackmail, and pornographic content need to be stopped and regulated. Being allowed to source from copyrighted material will only allow dangerous groups or individuals to keep producing material at the risk of the safety and wellbeing of Americans but only at a larger scale. Preventing copyrighted works would be one of the best ways to protect Americans and America&rsquo;s interest as bodies like the EU and Japan are already moving to prevent unregulated use and abuse of copyright and human rights. I implore you, do not allow copyrighted works be used in the training of AI, it sets a dangerous precedent on what Americans, an humans, can and should be allowed to profit from the expense of others and their hard work. Do not let AI be trained from copyrighted, human, works and do not let any form of AI generated material be allowed for copyright protection.<br/><br/>Thank You
