Artists and writers should give consent and receive compensation to be included in a training set, and images and writing resulting from AI should not be eligible for copyright without significant further human manipulation/improvement of the generated image. AI generated &quot;art&quot; is not a replacement for human generated art. As both an artist and writer, it&#39;s my opinion that the current existing models need to be destroyed, and replaced by models built using ethically sourced datasets. The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.
