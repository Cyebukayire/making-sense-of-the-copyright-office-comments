AI has become a bane on the creative industry, and should be scrapped as an idea for creative purposes entirely. Not only is it even more faulty than humans, it&rsquo;s stripping the creativity of actual human work and bastardizing it by mashing it into a blender filled with millions of others. It should not be given the ability to be copy written at all as none of it is properly obtained &ldquo;reference&rdquo; material. I&rsquo;ve had plenty of friends in both writing circles and artist circles have their work stolen by AI and used to create subpar renditions of said work. AI should have been developed for crunch work, but every time I see it now failing the most basic things, the less hope I have in it as a whole. AI just needs to be scrapped entirely as there is no way to go about it safely and ethically at the present. I also don&rsquo;t think there is currently enough scientific development to actually make it ethical, if ever. <br/>AI has become completely unethical at this point as studios are now stealing faces, voice bites, and animation sequences from creators to avoid paying people for the skills they bring to the table. AI has always been a way to cheat people out of their jobs and now their creative outlets.
