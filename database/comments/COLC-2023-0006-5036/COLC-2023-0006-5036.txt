Nothing &quot;created&quot; by a generative artificial intelligence should be protected by copyright. Federal judge  Beryl A. Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia already ruled against such a thing, arguing that human authorship is essential to copyright.<br/><br/>AI cannot truly create. It can only mimic based on the input fed to it. There is a current trend of feeding voice actors&#39; performances into a machine without their consent to allow the machine to perform in a facsimile of their voice. That output should not have any legal protection. Neither should any other work &quot;created&quot; by feeding another person&#39;s art, voice, written words, or other intellectual property into an algorithm.
