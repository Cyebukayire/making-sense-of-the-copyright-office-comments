I feel strongly that generative artificial intelligence can be a useful tool.  I use it to get quick, easy explanations for things that can come from very complex topics ranging from science to economics to just about anything.  However, as good as generative AI is at presenting material as original, it is always derivative, using information it scraped from someone else&#39;s hard, human work that has been posted to the Internet.  Sometimes, this information is fair use, but usually, it is not.  You, the Copyright Office, must make it clear to Congress that while each violation of copyright is different, copyright holders have the right to be compensated when someone else, including generative AI, uses their material, especially, but not limited to, when that use results in incoming revenue to the owner of the generative AI system or its partners.
