I believe that A.I needs to be heavily regulated in order to reduce theft of copyright, and possible creation of a new wave of disinformation. Bad actors or even rival campaigns could use a.i to make voice clips, images, and even video defaming their opponents, and significant damage could be done to either side before the fake images, speech or video can be prooven fake. This is a bipartisan issue that effects the entire world. Left unchecked A.I can be a tool of serious harm. Do not let the people violently pushing for A.I to be allowed to Astroturf this issue and inflate the amount of people in support.
