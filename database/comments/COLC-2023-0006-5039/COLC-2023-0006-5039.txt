To whom it may concern,<br/>I applaud the Copyright Office&rsquo;s recent efforts to highlight some of the emerging concerns about the impact of generative AI on a copyright framework designed to promote fairness and inclusivity in an era long before the impact of AI could be predicted on such topics as transparency, authorship, and fair use. Additionally, I find it helpful that the Office is willing to consider issues relating to likeness and publicity, which are not currently covered by federal regulation and sometimes covered at a state level.<br/>However, I find it disconcerting that the recent request for comments nor any of the questions within relate to contract law or terms of service, which I believe are important to consider for several reasons. <br/>First, reinterpretations of contract law, specifically as it relates to open-source licenses, are at the heart of many lawsuits relating to generative AI content that are often conflated as a copyright issue in the popular press. One example is the Joseph Saveri Law firm class action lawsuit against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI for violating conditions of open-source licenses on contract and privacy claims.<br/>Second, in theory, contract law should be adjudicated by parties with mutual levels of power in negotiations. This is at the heart of the writers&#39; and actors&rsquo; strikes in the US, fueled in part by contract provisions relating to the use of AI in films or for repurposing their likeness or work. But let&rsquo;s face it, the big studios, with much deeper pockets than most actors and writers, have been willing to hold out for months to achieve their position, to the detriment of all of us expecting high-quality content written and overseen by humans. <br/>Third, terms of service are unilaterally employed on users and content creators without any government oversight or assistance. In some cases, users fueled by public opinion can push back against increasing encroachments of data dignity, as evidenced by Zoom&rsquo;s recent change of its terms of service that allowed large-scale data harvesting that was later rescinded. <br/>Fourth, service providers with a virtual monopoly can impose new rules with absolutely no oversight under current regulations. For example, Google recently updated its privacy policy to analyze the information people share online to train new AI models. So, what happens when content creators who get paid for site visits start seeing potential visitors siphoned off to Google Search Generative Experience summaries of their work without clicking through? <br/>Fifth, in the current environment, we have allowed some service providers to become virtual monopolies within a particular domain. However, the current regulatory and legislative landscape lacks any mechanisms to push back when these monopolies adopt more onerous data aggregation policies that may conflict with our interests. <br/>I would invite the Copyright Office to include considerations about contracts and terms of service to be considered within the upcoming generative AI policy. I would specifically recommend that any organization with a monopoly (50% or greater market share) or secondary level (25% or greater market share) within a particular domain submit all contractual or terms of service updates to the most government agency for review and approval before acceptance. <br/>In addition, I would submit that any organization in this class with over 25% of market share within a specific domain also allows granular controls relating to terms of service and contracts that match each user&#39;s unique interests. <br/>At the same time, I acknowledge that this new level of granularity is going to be complex to implement at scale. However, this is much like how Comcast and other cable providers recently argued that spelling out their costs upfront would present a burden to the FCC, despite the fact they could put this on every user&rsquo;s bill in intricate detail. The FCC pushed back against this nonsense. Similarly, I would argue that companies that intend to take advantage of opportunities in generative AI should also be required to bear the burdens of making this work for users as well.<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/>George Lawton<br/>
