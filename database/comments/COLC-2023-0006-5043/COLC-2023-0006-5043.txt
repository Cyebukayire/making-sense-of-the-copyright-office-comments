AI operates by stealing people&#39;s work without permission to &quot;learn&quot; and &quot;create&quot; when, in reality, it takes people&#39;s work and mixes that work together to pretend to make something new. Artists using someone else&#39;s photograph to create something new have been in trouble for breaking copyright law. AI is no different and should be considered much worse. <br/><br/>The case brought by the AP against Shepard Fairey already provides legal backing that using other people&#39;s work without permission is against the law. We have cases in music with Pharrell Williams v. Bridgeport Music. These cases can blur the lines, but it is very clear that AI trainers take images without the original artist&#39;s permission and feed them to their machines to copy.
