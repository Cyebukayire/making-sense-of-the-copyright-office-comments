It&#39;s an absolute disgrace that anyone is currently allowed to freely scrape information, mutilate it, reassemble it, and then claim it as their own. There should, under absolutely no circumstances, be any AI model training outside of opt-in-only; anything else is blatant theft and should be considered a crime. Any model trained on data that wasn&#39;t explicitly opted into is utilizing stolen information.
