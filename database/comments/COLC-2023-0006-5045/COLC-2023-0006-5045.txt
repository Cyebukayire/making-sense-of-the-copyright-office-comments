AI generated Art, scripts, wording, etc. should not be allowed to be copy written. Time and time again the creators of such models have proven they are incapable and find no accountability in training their creation off private property or copy written work. Yet they strive to drive profit without producing any work that the AI is trained off of, yet provide no credit or compensation to those art and styles they stole from. To allow such AI work to be copy written and owned would be to further legalize the piracy of art and ideas. Further more, using the AI systems to replicate actors, characters, and animations of hard working humans steals the identity and hard work actors and voice actors put in to create content for other humans. Allowing the continued theft of human creation and soul further dehumanizes the arts. If the creators of AI were to take responsibility and compensated those from which they steal to train their AI models on, then I wouldn&#39;t have an issue with it, but this is not the case. They feel a few lines of code absolve them of responsibility, accountability, and place themselves above the law of copy write infringement themselves, while striving to protect their &quot;assets.&quot; If AI is learning from public domain, then it&#39;s creations are public domain. If it is learning from private artists and creators, then it belongs to them, not the people who wrote the code.
