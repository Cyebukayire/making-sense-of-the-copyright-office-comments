I think that AI is currently used very unethically. As an artist I am upset to see the corpus of stolen works that Stable Diffusion and other models train off of. Countless artists have described their art being stolen, aped, and then money made off of that mockery of their work. I should emphasize that no matter what the AIs generate, even if it&#39;s wholly &quot;original&quot; and not based on any specific artist&#39;s style, is still built off the back of unlicensed, uncredited, and unsanctioned writing and art. This is unacceptable. I believe that if any models are to be made and used, they should be only with work that is either 1. in the public domain 2. has explicitly been licensed to be used in that model&#39;s training set.<br/><br/>Aside from the unethicality of the training set, the usage of AI to deceive is disturbing. Authors have had their names put on AI generated books, artists have seen prints sold of &quot;their work&quot; that is actually AI generated &quot;in the style of&quot; them. This is repugnant and slanderous at best...<br/><br/>...At worst it&#39;s outright dangerous and will lead to people&#39;s deaths:<br/>https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/29/us/ai-scam-calls-kidnapping-cec/index.html<br/>https://slashdot.org/story/23/08/29/1440230/life-or-death-ai-generated-mushroom-foraging-books-are-all-over-amazon#:~:text=Many%20of%20these%20books%20are,prompt%20said%20it%20was%20safe.<br/><br/>A potential solution for this is that AI generated work (assuming that it&#39;s only been trained on things the AI creators have permission to use) must identify itself as being AI generated or be subject to being penalized under the law.<br/><br/>That&#39;s all I have to comment right now, but I am happy that there is action being taken on this. The state of AI in general is extremely worrying to me so I think addressing it ASAP is critical. Thank you.
