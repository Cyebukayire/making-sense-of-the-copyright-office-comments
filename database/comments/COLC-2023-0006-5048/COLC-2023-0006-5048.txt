AI, while fun to mess around with, should NOT be allowed to copyright things, Especially since AI are stealing other&#39;s work. If we were to allow AI images to be copyrighted, it removes the sanctity of the copyright. AI stole its database from other people&#39;s copyrighted works, but now because corporations want to make money and not pay people and steal, we&#39;re just suppose to let them? NO.
