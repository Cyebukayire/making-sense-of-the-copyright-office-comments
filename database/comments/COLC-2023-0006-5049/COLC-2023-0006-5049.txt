Thank you for opening this matter to public comment.<br/><br/>I am a writer whose living depends on the ability to monetize my work. As such, the matter of so-called &ldquo;AI&rdquo; models is of great importance to me.<br/><br/>The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.&nbsp;This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work. Applying this system to generative AI is only fair &mdash; generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright.<br/><br/>In order to protect the welfare of artists and creatives of all kinds, the Copyright Office should rule that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Additionally, as there is no real author of works created by such a system, the Copyright Office should rule that such works must be considered public domain, and can only be copyrighted after undergoing a transformation by one or more human artists/authors.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration on this matter.
