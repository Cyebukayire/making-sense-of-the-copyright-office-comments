&quot;Aritificial Intelligence&quot; is falsely named. It is not intelligent and does not think. It&#39;s a probability model which can only operate off huge swaths of content, which does not distinguish between copyrighted or free use content, and illegally repurposes for commercial gain. The &quot;black box&quot; nature of the probability model means there is no accountability for the theft of copyrighted content nor is there any way for creators of copyrighted content to identify if their copyright has been infringed. These machines should not be allowed to hold copyrights, on the grounds that A) there is no human person responsible for the creation of any specific material, B) there is no way to adequately credit, seek permission, or verify fair use of the data used to create that material, and C) even one piece of copyrighted content absorbed into the AI without permission poisons the entire dataset and, given the massive scale of these datasets and the automated collection methods, it can basically be guaranteed that it contains copyrighted content, either maliciously or accidentally.
