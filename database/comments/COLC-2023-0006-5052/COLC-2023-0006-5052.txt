AI does not belong in any creative/artistic field. Period. Because it needs to be fed data to learn, none of these programs have been created and taught without getting express permission from the ORIGINAL CREATORS to use their work to teach these programs. The use of AI in these fields should be banned, and any work that was stolen to teach these programs should allow for the original creator of those works to seek compensation.
