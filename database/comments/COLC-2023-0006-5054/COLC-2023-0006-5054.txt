I am firmly of the opinion that if a piece produced using AI/machine learning that has been trained on data the creators had no explicit consent to use, then those responsible for producing the piece are in direct violation of copyright. For example trying to produce an oil painting of a specific scene in a popular artist&#39;s style, by feeding the artist&#39;s works into the algorithm when the artist has not given consent for that. I would also say that a human must have significantly edited and adjusted an AI-produced work in order to reasonably say they had a hand in making it, beyond just feeding the algorithm specific prompts.
