As a writer, I would find it to be a complete copyright violation to have an AI model trained to mimic my style or voice by being fed copyrighted works written by me. The appropriation of my text to train an AI application would require a human actor, and that human and any other humans who used the resulting AI application should be legally liable for infringing on my copyright. I believe the act of feeding copyrighted text into an AI application is essentially building a machine to break copyright and to pirate a style and sensibility I have worked for thousands of hours to develop. My style and sensibility have been won by hard human experience, reflection, and a great deal of reading and trial and error. This represents (if I were to charge an hourly rate) a massive expense to create that style and sensibility. To use the results of that hard-won experience to generate text is to appropriate all of the life experiences and expenses used to create that writing&mdash;all without any form of compensation. Feeding writers&rsquo; work into an AI application should be illegal unless the writer explicitly consents, and AI applications should retain records of texts that are fed into it and produce citations that recognize those texts.
