AI generated products should not be allowed to use reference material to generate anything if they have not received explicit permission from the creator of said reference material. Music, Illustration, Video, etc, all art belongs first and foremost to the person who created it, and should not be stolen to be used in an AI database. Permission should be specifically given, and not simply hidden as a tiny checkbox in the middle of a terms and conditions acceptance. Consent for the use of art in an AI database needs to be informed and enthusiastic, not accidental or coerced.
