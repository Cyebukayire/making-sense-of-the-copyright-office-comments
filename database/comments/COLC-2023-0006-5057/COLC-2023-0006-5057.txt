Ai is trained off of stolen works, already under a copyright to begin with. It is unethical in its very foundation. Works from AI should not be given a copyright. Doing so will only encourage theft for financial means, from many artists, hobby and industry alike. Please help protect the work and right to work of artists not only in our country, but around the world. The destruction of industry on our hands threatens a multitude of livelihoods, and with decreasing jobs, and more people fighting over what few are available, our eceonomy stands to tank even harder than it currently is. People cannot pay for goods if they themselves are not paid. Please protect the copyright of artists,  rather than attempting to copyright the thefts of these artists&#39; work.
