As a voice actor, I am concerned around copyrights in three ways: 1) Copyrighted works being used to feed/seed AI, without being credited, 2) Companies that make AI-generated work and then copyright what the AI has created, 3) AI-generated voice prints being used to create audiobooks or other audio format versions of copyrighted works without the human whose voice it is knowing. For #2, similar to how bots and companies &quot;farm&quot; URL codes (registering domains that they do not intend to use, and then selling those domains to businesses that have a legitimate use for them), my concern is that a group could use AI to create a glut of work containing any concepts they can think of, so that they can claim copyright infringement against human creators.
