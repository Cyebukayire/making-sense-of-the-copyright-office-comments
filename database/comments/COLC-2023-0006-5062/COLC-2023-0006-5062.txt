While AI computer learning can have beneficial technical applications, the use of it on creative works is very troubling. Artists and writers are non consensually having their works scraped for training AI. This training is teaching the machine how to copy works, put a few filters on and repackage the work as it&#39;s own. Which for all intents and purposes is stealing. It&#39;s stealing intellectual property but also revenue as the artist&#39;s original work could exist in obscurity while the copied work gets passed through popular sites and even sold. The second thing AI does when scraping creative works is copying the style of the work. This means the machine can steal completed works AND fabricate new ones, completely boxing the artist out of profiting from their work. It means people who&#39;ve worked on unique graphic and literary style are out of a job because they can&#39;t compete with a machine churning out work mimicking theirs. Not only is this killing art from a creativity standpoint but taking money from artists. Being an artist or writer should be able to be a career where a person&#39;s work is protected so they can make a living. Creativity will crumble if these fields can&#39;t support anyone. We are living in a time where art is under attack with waves of anti-intellectualism and machine automated art will be another mail in the coffin if left unregulated. What&#39;s worse is many of the people behind AI scraping know what they&#39;re doing cheapens art and they aim to make artists obsolete.
