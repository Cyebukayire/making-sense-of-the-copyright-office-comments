Generative AI has been built unethically by scraping thousands and thousands of pieces of writing and art without regards to getting consent from the creator or honoring copyright. Consent is key when it comes to generative AI and many creators did not consent for their work to be scraped. Transparency is needed and copyright must be honored. In order for images and writing to be scraped, permission must be granted and creators should be compensated for the use of their work. Also, copyright should not be granted to works not authored by humans.
