AI is an absolutely vile tool and let&rsquo;s be real it is just a tool. There is no intelligence, it just regurgitates a pale imitation of what it was fed. As someone who has done an extensive amount of creative writing in my life the idea of someone taking something I wrote and feeding it into an AI program feels like an utter violation. The only people who seem to be interested in AI are people who are unwilling or unable to create for themselves. So they create an ai image and call it art, or pump a half finished story of someone else&rsquo;s just to see how it ends. They feel no remorse because they have no idea how difficult creating can be. Hours spent agonizing over every little detail to get it just right. It&rsquo;s not easy and it takes time and dedication. To promote ai is to spot in the face of every writer and artist who ever lived it&rsquo;s an absolute travesty. When I was young I saw the trend of machines being relied upon more and more for the purpose of making things easier and safer for people. Have a magazine Dona dangerous job so that a person need not risk their life. I never imagined a dystopian future in which machines create our art for us and write our stories while humans toil away at menial jobs. It&rsquo;s abhorrent and makes me dread the future even more than I already do. My point is that from the very earliest existence of mankind there has been an urge to create from cave wall pairings to stories passed on by word of mouth. We are human and each of us is full of stories, they&rsquo;re what make us who we are. And when you place importance of art created by a machine who cannot truly think or feel, it&rsquo;s doing a disservice to every person who&rsquo;s ever tried to turn their pain or joy into art. Please, I am begging you. Leave art to the artists and leave AI alone. In conclusion, AI bad!
