AI generated content should belongo to the public domain and not subject to copyright protections.  First because the diffuse neural networks used to recognize patterns and generate the content are trained using existing material, it&acute;s a form of plagiarism but done in such a manner in which the sintaxis is changed so it can pass (sometimes barely) as an original idea. AI defeats the main principle of copyright; The protection of original material created by an author. AI work is not original, it needs to be injected a good amount of references for the algorithm to copy when given a prompt.  I strongly believe that it has to be treated as nothing more than complex calculators that are useful and novel but are designed to circumvent copywright law.<br/>Art and culture has been created by people up to this point, copyright law was a form to recognize the economic value of originality and creativity in society. AI will destroy that, if we doesn&acute;t put boundaries to it in the future there will not be any original idea anymore, companies will choose to use AI Generated content over human original work the cultural power of ideas, art, lliterature will be devalued to mere souvenirs. That&acute;s why I think copyright law should not protect material generated by AI first because it&acute;s not original even if it appears to be and second because there is no author to protect, I think any work created using generative AI should immediatly become public domain since it doesnt bring any cultural value.
