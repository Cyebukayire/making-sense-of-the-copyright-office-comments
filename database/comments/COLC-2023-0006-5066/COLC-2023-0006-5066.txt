Copyright was formed with human creations in mind, and therefore copyright protection should not apply to machine-generated creation in any way, shape, or form. A human who meticulously creates a song using synthetic vocals and instruments is not the same as clicking &quot;generate&quot; on an image generator, and using someone&#39;s voice or art without permission in such a generator is at the very least a violation of that person&#39;s right to privacy.
