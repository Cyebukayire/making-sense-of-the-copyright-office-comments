Hello. My name is Emily Lubanko. I am an artist and designer living in Boston, MA. I am writing to you about the AI problem, why it is stolen work at its core, and why it should never be copyright-able.<br/><br/>The reason that AI should never be copyrightable&mdash; and should have its use restricted &mdash; is that it is built entirely on stolen work, it is not made by a human person, and it requires no human effort. <br/><br/>The way the technology works is that it generates an image based on a dataset of stolen work. These &ldquo;datasets&rdquo; are actually just images that were stolen, en masse, from the internet&mdash; including from artists&rsquo; personal websites, social media, etc. No permission was granted&mdash; they just scraped the internet and stole. Even if that stolen work is removed after, the data remains in the dataset and can be used later. <br/><br/>The work is in fact SO stolen that many artists find their signatures still-intact in AI generated images. Living artists like Greg Rutkowski, for example, are being stolen from daily.<br/><br/>https://www.creativebloq.com/features/greg-rutkowski-ai-art-prompts<br/>https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/artificial-intelligence-ai-art-ethics-greg-rutkowski-1.6679466<br/>https://decrypt.co/150575/greg-rutkowski-removed-from-stable-diffusion-but-brought-back-by-ai-artists<br/><br/>There are hundreds of articles, threads, and the like out there from different artists finding their signatures and their styles up for sale on places like Adobe Stock, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and the like. These companies are making money from that theft, while leaving the artists out to dry. No negotiation was made, no contracts, no permissions.<br/><br/>The attitude from tech in general of &ldquo;steal first, ask questions later&rdquo; has got to stop&mdash; so much is being run on stolen work, people are losing income, and it&rsquo;s affecting both quality of life and society. <br/><br/>There&rsquo;s also no human effort to AI. Pushing a button is not the same as the blood, sweat, and tears of creating a work. There&rsquo;s a difference between making creative work easier (digital art versus traditional art, which still requires a human hand) versus pushing a button and generating an image farmed entirely from stolen work. <br/><br/>There&rsquo;s also the impact of this technology on what I would call the general category of Quality of Human Life. Art is about many things, but often, no matter the subject, it&rsquo;s about different ways that humans connect with one another. Whether it&rsquo;s a painting of a dragon, a flower, a scene of grief, a scene of joy, a scene of complex emotions&mdash; the meaning comes from the fact that a person made it with intent. Each brush stroke, each act of the hand, has intent and history. An artist chooses a color based on so many factors. When we look at art made by human beings it is suffused with meaning, and that meaning give us connection to other people. This artist painted a yellow tablecloth because it is the same color as the one in her deceased grandmother&rsquo;s house that she misses. This artist painted a scene of mourning in memory of his wife, the meaning woven into the rough-hewn brush strokes on the bark of the very trees. Faces in paintings are taken from friends, family, and memories of that person. And when we look at that art, we see the familiar and the unfamiliar, and it teaches us about the world while connecting us, no matter where we are from.<br/><br/>AI &ldquo;art&rdquo;, conversely, is all stolen, no meaning. It amplifies theft, and amplifies a cultural loneliness. Art made by robots parroting other peoples&rsquo; stolen emotions is nothing. It&rsquo;s not art. It&rsquo;s theft, and it generates nothing but sadness for the artist, and missed connections between people. In a world with increasing alienation and loneliness, we do not need to amplify that.<br/><br/>Philosophy aside, it&rsquo;s also&hellip; just theft.<br/><br/>We also now have publishers and big companies deciding to use this Stolen Art Technology to &ldquo;generate&rdquo; work that is directly lifted from the artists it once hired. It&rsquo;s putting people out of work while stealing directly from them.<br/><br/>For these reasons and 1000 more, please do not ever allow AI art to be copyrighted. Every AI work is theft. With how this technology works, there is no escaping it.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>-Emily<br/>
