Allowing AI generated materials to be copyrightable would allow corporations to outsource creative labor to generative processes that pull content from hardworking creatives and redistribute it for profit without any of that initial labor being acknowledged or compensated. It is imperative for the sake of the landscape of creative works that the generative processes we colloquially refer to as &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; have limitations on mass-scale commercial use. Unless all of the individual images or texts in an AI&#39;s database are the commercial property of the people redistributing it, or licensed to be used in this manner, then there is no way that profit should be legally allowed from these outputs.
