Ai, especially generative AI is the epitome of mass theft of all creatives in many fields. It robs them of their own copyright, art, voices, and uses that to compete in the same market as those creatives. This puts thousands upon millions out of work from this exploitation. There should be no copyright given to a program that is reliant on theft first. Giving such a program copyright sends a very disturbing message that theft and exploitation come first in America, where we are supposed to have protections against such exploitation.
