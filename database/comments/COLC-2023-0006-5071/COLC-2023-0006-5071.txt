I have experienced harm from AI webcrawlers before. I am a hobby writer so my writing is viewable online. It was announced in May of 2023, that the website I use to post my work had been scraped by AI webcrawlers, and that everyone&#39;s works had been included in data sets such as ChatGPT. No one, including the site owners, had given permission to ChatGPT or other Generative AI sites to scrape it. Now my works and the works of others are being plagiarized to generate writing without any benefit to us. I also know several people who have had their writing uploaded to Generative AIs such as ChatGPT by individuals without their permission. <br/><br/>These sites could not be trained without the scrape of writing without the writer&#39;s permission. As of September 1, 2023, the site I post to has 11,660,000 works posted to it from 6,206,000 users. That means over 6 million people had their works scraped for data without their permission. This doesn&#39;t even touch the statistics from places like Facebook, Twitter, and Other Social Medias. I believe this to be a violation of copyright and intellectual property rights. If writers have rights to their work to prevent individual use without their permission, then I think that it should apply to AI Generation by corporations/companies as well.
