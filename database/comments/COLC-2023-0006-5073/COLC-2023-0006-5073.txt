Works created by artificial intelligence not only pose a threat to we proud many who have worked and studied to become masters in our fields, (Coding, writing, theatre, fine arts, painting, literature, software engineering, computer analysis, teaching, human resources, book keeping, treasury, just to name a few), it is a perverted mockery of human creation. AI does have it&#39;s place in our society, but it must be controlled and it must have thoroughly communicated guidelines. It&#39;s existence can be useful, it can be helpful, but it is not necessary until we who have passion for our work are legally protected. Until our works that we have spent countless hours, days, and years to create via our own divine will and our sheer willingness to labor out of love are LEGALLY and COMPLETELY protected from the thievery of AI training. <br/>AI should be a tool to help streamline the processes of mundane and inconsequential chores that are not a necessity to the public. It should, under no circumstances, be legally allowed to rob humans of the joy and passion of creativity. <br/>We are creatures who were put on this earth to create and it is our God given right to be financially compensated for our blood sweat and tears. We should not live under the fear of AI replacement. <br/><br/>An AI program can soullessly recreate a work of art, but it will never cary the amount of love, joy, history, and passion that a master of his craft could create. <br/><br/>Thank you so much for you time.
