Thank you for taking the time to recognize public comment, and to acknowledge the rapidly-changing world that we find ourselves in.<br/><br/>I am an artist, specializing in the fields of drawing, painting, and illustration. I make my living through artistic expression, and the sales of commissioned artwork. While I can&#39;t speak with expertise to the effects generative AI will have on other artists (such as singers, actors, or writers), I can definitely give you some perspective into it from the field of visual art.<br/><br/>If I am honest, AI art scares the hell out of me. There are two primary reasons for this. The first is economic: generative AI image-making software threatens not just one job, but an entire FIELD of careers. Even the fastest illustrator I know could not produce artwork at the rate AI generators can. The machine can generate hundreds of broken iterations, often times with glaring anatomical flaws or consistency issues, in the time it takes an artist to produce a thoughtful and pleasing piece of artwork. It is extremely important to recognize that businesses and large corporations who require visual assets value speed and low cost over quality. Thus, an AI that can spit out a myriad of low-quality images for effectively no cost would be an attractive decision. Large swaths of visual artists, all with families and financial obligations, will suddenly be without careers or livelihoods. This would be a disaster for the economy.<br/><br/>The second reason I find AI a terrifying prospect is because of what it says about humanity. As I mentioned earlier, AI generators create broken and repetitive images that usually feel &#39;off&#39; to the viewer. They might pass at a quick glance, but any close examination leads to disturbing findings. It is not art; it is a facsimile, predicated on the theft of real artists&#39; hard work. We did not consent to let the algorithms train on our styles or themes - they were stolen from us without our knowledge, without even so much as a citation of source. It is not only economically harmful, but downright insulting that the tech wizards in silicon valley think art is something that can be automated by a machine. It belittles our craft, our study, our years spent learning and schooling. It belittles the human experience.<br/><br/>When George W. Bush left office, what did he do? He retired to his ranch and became a painter. If you were to ask almost anyone what they would do if they retired, most folks would respond with some creative pursuit. They would learn to paint, or travel the world taking photographs. They would rediscover woodworking, or write that novel that&#39;s been in their head. Creative expression is a deeply human need. It is then profoundly crushing to see art being reduced to nothing but a soulless algorithm. The creators of AI generators misunderstand the issue. They are not trying to free the human spirit so it can pursue its potential - they are canning that potential so we can pursue drudgery. Every artist I have spoken to feels strongly on the matter, and many have said they would quit or even contemplate self-destruction should AI consume the field. It&#39;s already happening across many art gallery sites online. One such site, DeviantArt, has been so heavily flooded by soulless and eerily-similar AI images that it has had to crack down on users uploading them. These assembly-line imitations lead to an overall homogenization of content. We can view the plight of DeviantArt as a microcosm for the rest of the media universe. Imagine that every mural, every advertisement, every movie and song, were all so eerily similar to one another as to be functionally indistinguishable from one another. We would lose the delight of finding something quirky, something new, or something funny. It would be no less than a deterioration of the human spirit.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I believe AI generated content needs to be regulated, and heavily. The creators of these algorithms must seek out permission and establish some pay schema to use artists&#39; work to train their machines. You can&#39;t use a song without paying royalities. You can&#39;t use a person&#39;s likeness without their permission. Why should it be any different for these image aggregators?<br/><br/>In closing, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you move swiftly to protect not just the jobs of millions of Americans in the creative field, but the human spirit as well.
