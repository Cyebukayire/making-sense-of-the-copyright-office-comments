Hello,<br/><br/>I believe the use of AI to generate imagery in it&#39;s varied forms need to be regulated. There is potentially extensive harm to the integrity of the usage of imagery as evidence in court to prove guilt or innocence of an individual, additionally it could be harmful to the identity of people &amp; harmful to intellectual property. Take for example, this very talented artist who specializes on hyper realistic art: https://www.instagram.com/jeffreyappiatu_art/ <br/><br/>It takes him 80+ hours of work to finish one piece.  If AI gets trained on photography or even hyper realistic art, the rate at which computers can at this point produce such high-detail imagery and how much faster they will get in the future - at the convenience of the palm of anyone&#39;s hand (in their smart phones) - the rate at which anyone can falsely accuse and produce &quot;evidence&quot; to harm others, can be quite terrifying. It would also devalue legitimate photography or videography in the forms of security footage etc, for court cases as mentioned before.<br/><br/>Additionally, it has harmed the entire eco-system &amp; livelihood of many artists, most noticeably in the digital world. There is a lot of AI &quot;Models&quot; that are trained using artwork of specific artists to have the AI create images to look as if the artist themselves created them without knowledge or permission of the artists. In many cases, people who are &quot;training&quot; these AI programs with these &quot;Models&quot; are receiving pay from these pieces as if they put in the level of work the original artist would have.  A lot of these &quot;models&quot; are also being used to create NSFW (not safe for work) content, which many of the original artists would refuse to do due to moral/ethical reasons. This technology could be used to sign a check or contract with your own hand-writing. Without your knowledge or consent, and if allowed to run rampant, you would not be able to do anything about it. This is just at the simple level of having an image of your signature. Once it starts using your photos and even your voice, things can get much more worse.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a lot of the people advocating for the use of &quot;anything&quot; to train AI &amp; being able to create anything with it - and consider it copyrightable, are either showing a lack of concern, or being disingenuous with the intent of exploiting the technology without considering the potential harm it can cause in the future. They want to push for &quot;opt out&quot; only regulation which would require people who may have no knowledge that any media (photos, videos, etc) to request that any of these &quot;creators&quot; do not use that information to train their AI &quot;models&quot; or produce any media that uses that information. There also is no way to prove that the information was not used to train the AI &quot;Models&quot; (due to lack of regulation). Nor is there any method to go into each AI &quot;model&quot; and &quot;untrain&quot; it from using the information requested to be removed out of the training set.  <br/><br/>A lot of the issues and problems with the current iteration of AI would&#39;ve been prevented if the people who were enabling it or training these AI &quot;models&quot; had gone with an &quot;Opt-in&quot; only method to get results from the technology. Regulation of AI will protect intellectual property and the identity of people. <br/><br/>To summarize, yes please regulate the use of AI and protect the already existing media from the potential abuse of it. Do not allow it to steal the work of others (using it without their knowledge is theft). Any media created with AI (even if modified after) needs to be properly labeled as such.
