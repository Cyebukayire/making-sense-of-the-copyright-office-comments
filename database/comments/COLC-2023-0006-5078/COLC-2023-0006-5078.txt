Hi! I&#39;m a college student from CT who primarily uses the internet for entertainment, educational, and community purposes. I think that generative AI as it is now, and how it has been trained, severely violates copyright. It is incredibly unlikely (and outright refuted in some testimonials I have seen from creators I follow on social media) that the AI/AIs obtained consent from every creator of the data/works it was trained on. Even using public domain images/text/etc, the internet (and its users) did not have the information and tools available to properly consent or label their creations appropriately for intended usage. The amount of data that an AI processes cannot be compared to a human, which allows it to obtain and store data that then persists even if the creator deletes it. At minimum, I agree with the position that generative AI should be forced to start over without all of the data it has collected. The danger that comes from unsecured sensitive information in use by a prototype machine learning agent is not insignificant, as seen in the several security breaches found during the DEF CON hacking convention in Las Vegas this year. This technology needs regulations now, especially as companies rush to integrate it into their businesses.
