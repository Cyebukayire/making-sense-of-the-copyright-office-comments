I support legislation to restrict copyright protections to only works created by humans and I am against anything that would give AI protection in any legal way. AI works derived from feeding an AI stolen works done by humans should be illegal and anyone training an AI using stolen works with the intent to sell what the AI comes up with, should be punished in some way for stealing and trying to monetize off of an artists works who did not agree to using their art in this way. AI is not due the protections a human&rsquo;s original work is. Real humans artists are being harmed monetarily due to the surge in AI work&rsquo;s proliferation in online spaces. We need legislation to protect real humans, not artificial intelligence.
