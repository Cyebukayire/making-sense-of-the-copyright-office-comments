Artificial intelligence serves as a threat to people&rsquo;s artistic copyrights, and needs to be regulated. To be able to create AI art or writing, the computer is fed thousands of peoples original artworks and writings without any of the artists being notified. The AI then creates pieces of art made out of real peoples stuff. AI commits theft, and in its current form is offered great leniency and permission to do so. It needs to be regulated to protect artists.
