AI in its current form is being trained on copyrighted material (digital art, photographs, writings, voice overs, music etc) and is already being used to replace the very jobs that its being trained on. This is not only infringing on intellectual property of individuals AND companies but it is also creating a massively inhospitable environment for people working in these areas (myself included) as there is no way to compete with a machine created to replace us.
