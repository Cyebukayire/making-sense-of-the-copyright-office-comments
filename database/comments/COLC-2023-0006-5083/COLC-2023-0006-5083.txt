I am upset with the current talks going on between lawmakers and the community, because the bulk of civilian attendees seem to be people who would benefit from lax legislation. (IE the CEOs of AI generative companies.) This is a terrible way to form policy, especially since the people being excluded are the ones who stand to lose the most. <br/><br/>For the record, these AI-generative machines are stealing art. They are committing copyright infringement. And then they&#39;re using that stolen art to generate new images. But the machine doesn&#39;t actually learn--it holds image data and generates new images from that. <br/><br/>As an expert in computer science with AI applications, I can tell you this for certain: A computer cannot create without holding data. It does not learn like a human and cannot replicate an image without already possessing that data. <br/><br/>Also, this is not speculation. If pressed for information about how the technology works, the CEOs of these companies will dance around the answer for a long time before telling you that the images are contained within the machine, AND no one asked the original artists permission to include them. <br/><br/>A huge problem with generative AI right now is called &quot;opt in by default,&quot; meaning that when a website introduces AI generative software, they scrape all existing data (which means they take all existing art/writing and incorporate it into their dataset) before giving the people to opt out of future art being included. This is extremely unethical. Artists who spend decades perfecting their craft are having their own art thrown into these machines which can do in 5 minutes what took them a lifetime to perfect. <br/><br/>And, worse, they are losing their jobs. Many gaming companies have fired all their employees except one to generate AI images. Many publications have fired their writers in order to generate articles with AI (which is notoriously erroneous at the best of times.) <br/><br/>If you do not stop this, it will lead to an absolute economical disaster, where artists who have trained on a specific skill will be jobless, with their life&#39;s work being used without their permission so large corporations can save money. There are currently no ethical datasets, and they all must be destroyed. If this is to be used at all, artists MUST be compensated, and all images uses must fall under royalty free/creative commons licenses. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
