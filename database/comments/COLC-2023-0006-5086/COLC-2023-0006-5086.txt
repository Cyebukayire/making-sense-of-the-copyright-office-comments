Generative AI models need data to function. They get trained on this data and wouldn&#39;t work the way they do without it. <br/>That&#39;s why these model should only be allowed to be trained on data that is completely free of any copyright or other protection. <br/><br/>Just because a picture, video, text or music file is openly available on the internet, doesn&#39;t mean that downloading/copying it and using it for whatever you want is allowed. <br/>You can&#39;t just use a picture of an artist in an ad campaign before asking/paying them. <br/>You can&#39;t just use the music of an artist in a movie before licensing it. <br/>You can&#39;t just copy a random fanfiction from the internet and sell it as your own story somewhere else. <br/>You can&#39;t just take a YouTube video, upload it on another platform and make money off of it.<br/><br/>All these types of media should be protected by the Berne Convention or other copyright laws/agreements that were introduced in countries around the world.<br/>Unless any of these contents are explicitly labeled as non-copyrighted, you should not be allowed to use them for your own benefits (excluding educational purposes), so also not for training an AI model off of them or using it to make money.<br/><br/>Many people claim that generative AI works like our human brain and therefore say that getting trained on data is no different from getting inspired  by simply looking at it through your human eyes.<br/>Recent studies have proven these claims as false. <br/>Current machine learning technology does not work like the human or any other animal&#39;s brain.<br/>A machine can&#39;t get inspired in the same way we can. The way current AI systems are working is just fundamentally different.<br/><br/>That&#39;s why there are also discussion if calling it artificial intelligence is even remotely accurate.
