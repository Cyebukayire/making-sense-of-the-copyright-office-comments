As a professional illustrator, I have many concerns about the development and use of AI technologies, and especially the effect they are having and will having on the creative industries. My experience is in visual art, but I believe that my concerns and experiences are similar to those of other artists, such as writers and musicians. It seems unethical that these technologies have been developed on art created by thousands of human artists, and that these technologies are making profit for those who created them, when they haven&#39;t paid the artists who&#39;s works they trained their models on, or even asked for their consent. It is possible that human artists could be replaced by AI, and that the technology that replaces them was created with their very own art. I&#39;m also concerned with the far reaching consequences for human workers across all professions. It seems to me that many entry level jobs could go to AI, leaving people without work, and without the means to get a job that they can learn and grow with. <br/><br/>Another concern I have is for the misuse of these technologies. Scams are already a huge problem in our world. It can be hard to tell truth from lies. AI technologies are only making it easier for scammers to pray on people, as their scams become more believable and harder to tell apart from reality. I feel it&#39;s dangerous to grant access to this technology to the general public, and that even in the hands of specialized individuals it could cause great harm. <br/><br/>I think that these technologies should be carefully regulated, and used only with careful consideration and digression. Their potential for harm is huge.
