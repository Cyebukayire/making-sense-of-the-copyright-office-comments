I am an artist. I have spent more than two decades honing my craft, and learning how to create works that are up to my personal standards. I have been fairly secure in the fact that copyright was on my side, and that should my art be used against my will I would have clear legal protection. But no more. My art, and the art of my peers, is being scraped constantly for use in training generative AI that we did not consent to.<br/><br/>Such products (because that&#39;s what they are: Products, and those that are currently free to use will not REMAIN free to use) would not work without OUR hard work, without OUR dedication to improvement. Yet while they make millions off of the backs of millions of artists, we get nothing in return save for ridicule and reassurance that society doesn&#39;t need us any more. I&#39;ve checked out generative AI and how it functions with images, and in return to prompts I&#39;ve gotten almost exact copies of art that already exists that I have personally seen, showing that the results are far more reliant on single pieces than is claimed. I&#39;ve seen plenty of people have similar results. What&#39;s more is that it does not take much skill to get a desired result out of generative AI, as much like a search engine it is programmed to give you results that seem most relevant. Because ultimately, generative AI in its current state is more akin to a search engine than it is to an actual person&#39;s mind. <br/><br/>Many of the people who insert prompts will insist that this is a creative act on its own and deserves to be copyrightable, ignoring that not only are they trampling the copyright of real artists, but that they are more akin to a patron at a restaurant asking for walnuts on their salad than they are the chef preparing their meal. As an artist, I feel that allowing AI works to be copyrighted would be incredibly damaging to actual creators. Not only would companies try to further avoid paying artists for their work as possible, they would be making free use of the works of other artists without so much as credit. This is no conspiracy, either, this is what happened with Marvel&#39;s &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;. If this is not nipped in the bud it will get worse, and already sparse creative teams will be pared down to the bare minimum, paid the bare minimum, and the artists whose works were cannibalized by generative AI will see not a cent of the billions in profits that rely in part on their work.<br/><br/>I must note that I am not completely against the technology. I am against its current methods. A generative AI trained on non-copyright material as well as materials offered up directly by the original artists would be interesting, and fun. The programs themselves are fascinating tech, and if their use of materials without any form of consent was not an issue I would love to see where the technology could go. But the core issue is that the training is handled unethically, and that it damages the creators of the works scraped for data. <br/><br/>If they gathered data for their AI ethically, I would be in support of the programs - though not the push to make their outputs copyrightable - because I love technology and seeing what it can accomplish. So please, do not assume this is a post by some technophobe as many proponents of generative AI will claim. A large number of artists, myself included, make use of new technologies in our work process all the time, and are as far from being technophobic as you can get. What we object to is the use of our work without our say and without compensation.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out that many of the the creators of generative AI know that their scraping methods are unethical, and should be illegal to charge access to. The groups making music-based generative AI are purposefully avoiding copyrighted music because of just how strong the music industry&#39;s hold on copyright is compared to other industries. Generative AI companies are knowingly taking advantage of the comparably weak protections on drawn, painted, written, and other such works.<br/><br/>There is also the issue of the use of agreements before generative AI became a reality to claim a generative AI is ethical, such as Adobe&#39;s case where there are now many photographers who are rightfully claiming this was not something they consented to, as there was nothing stating that this would be a possible use for their stock photos.<br/><br/>In closing, please do not allow generative works to be copyrightable, and please make some form of ruling which would make it illegal to charge access to AI which trains on copyrighted materials that are not expressly given to them by the creator, as well as a ruling which would make it illegal to take a back catalogue of work (such as Adobe&#39;s stock photos) and make it a place to scrape for content without the express permission of the original creator.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
