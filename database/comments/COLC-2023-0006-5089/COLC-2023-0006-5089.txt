Hello, <br/><br/>I, as well as many of my close friends will be affected by the use of AI in many different ways. I do not feel that Artificial Intelligence should be copyrightable, seeing as the entire premise is based on scraping and taking parts of other (copyrighted) works. I do not believe a piece of art that is solely created using art, writing, etc. from other entities should protected under copyright law. Before we can even consider allowing AI generated works to be copyrighted, we need more regulations on what can and cannot be scraped.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as an American, I believe in creating a strong and healthy workforce. Allowing copyright of AI generated works will decimate a large part of the work force, such as filmwriters, concept artists (game, show, etc,) and animators. This will ultimately force more people (possibly an entire section of the economy) to rely on government aid as they struggle to find work, and of course be out a career. As we&rsquo;ve seen by recent strikes, film writers are already a struggling body of people who need more protections, not less. This goes for many artist driven fields.<br/><br/>In summary, I do not believe an AI generated work, created off of other copyrighted works, should hold the same legal protections. I also do not believe that we should leave people jobless in what many consider an incredibly difficult time for the economy.<br/><br/>Thank You.<br/><br/>(I would also like to add - the use of the human captcha on this page is very telling. We tend to want humans to do the work.)
