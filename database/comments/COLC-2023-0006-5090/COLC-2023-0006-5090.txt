I am a professional working artist.  Usually I am able to turn around more than $1m in IP/yr.  I have recently had more than one company lie to me about whether they are using my intellectual property for AI training.  I have had to delete content from the cloud, and archive it separately while still paying for services.  Copyright law was decided as &#39;intellectual property made by a human&#39;.  Yet companies are still stealing IP.  In addition to this there is a problem of  monoculture, group think, and uniform-ication which results as the AI creates the most generic version of what it has been designed to generate. This bigfooting and genericness stifles innovation and new/small businesses.  It also polices thought as it discards and mutes non-mainstream voices.
