AI generative art algorithms as they currently exist form images, written word, and other data and output made using data stolen from human artists and laborers. Copyright exists to ensure that the humans whose labors create works will be the ones to profit from any monetary value their work creates. AI algorithm derived content must not be allowed to continue as it currently is, and the humans who create the original art and data must be fairly compensated for their labor.
