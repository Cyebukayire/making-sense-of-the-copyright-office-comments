AI and Machine Learning Algorithms, particularly generative AI programs constitute a mass scale theft of the labor and works of millions of creatives in every field. It robs them all of their copyright, art, voices, and then uses their own works to generate derivative works that compete in the same markets at those creatives. It&#39;s exploitation on an unseen scale and shouldn&#39;t be tolerated. Just allowing them to exist would put thousands upon millions out of work. Nothing an AI generates should ever be copyrightable. It is fundamentally built on theft and scrubbing away any credit or rights of those whose data upon which it is trained without any form of compensation or notice. If we allow such programs to have their outputs copyrighted, it sends a clear and direct message that America consents to the theft and exploitation of not only its own people, but that the rights of a math equation could overrule and undermine the very idea of copyright if anything that is copyrighted can just be exploited by saying &quot;an AI did it&quot;. America is supposed to have protections against such exploitation. Please do not allow AI to have any form of copyright.
