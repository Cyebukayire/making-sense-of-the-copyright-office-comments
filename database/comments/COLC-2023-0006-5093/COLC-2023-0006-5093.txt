Thank you for opening this period for us to be able to voice our opinions, personally, as members of and consumers of digital media that could be affected by artificial intelligence. I hope that this comment, in addition to others, will benefit the Copyright Office&#39;s ability to understand and take action on the potential consequences of generative algorithms.<br/><br/>I am an amateur voice actress and would like, one day, to work professionally in the industry. I am also closely related to and an avid supporter of digital artists in my life, both as mentors and as peers and friends. I have seen the concern and distress this has given them and I wish to give comments that will speak for them, as well as give them the opportunity to speak for themselves.<br/><br/>Inherently, artificial intelligence, or more accurately, content-producing algorithmic systems, are not harmful. They can allow for inspiration, for perspectives outside what the artist may have expected, and they can provide a voice for people who may not have the ability to express themselves in the medium that speaks to them. <br/><br/>However, the problem of these algorithms arise when one considers how they are able to generate these images, audio, or text. These are algorithms, not actual sentient intelligence. They cannot produce something from nothing. Therefore, most, if not all, major algorithmic systems (I.E. Midjourney, DALL-E), scrape data and media from the internet without the original artists&#39; consent or knowledge. This has served to allow people to imitate or replace the work of creators and artists without their knowledge, consent, or compensation. <br/><br/>On an individual level, this is an annoyance, and perhaps an issue that does not require legislation, though every artist I know would prefer it, for the sake of their own livelihood. On a corporate level, however, algorithmically generated content can, has, and will take away the need or desire for talented artists, actors, musicians, writers, and creators, depriving them of their jobs, livelihoods, and passions. One need only look to the months-long strike by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA to see the harm that these corporations are doing. <br/><br/>As a voice actress, I&#39;m afraid to step into the professional industry currently, as I worry that my voice could be recorded and taken by a studio and, using these AI algorithms, use my voice without compensating me and replacing my opportunity to speak for myself. My voice could be used against me, to speak things I do not believe in or would never say. <br/><br/>At the least, I ask that the Copyright Office strongly considers regulations on AI-generated content, continuing to block its ability to be copyrighted, and support the work of individuals who create the things that we, as a society, live for. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration. I wish all the best for the Copyright Office in their consideration of this matter.
