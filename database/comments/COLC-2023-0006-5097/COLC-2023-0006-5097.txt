AI, as it is now at the very least, cannot create original content. This is an undeniable fact. Strictly due to the way AI works, works made using AI being marked as original content would be theft, and rightfully so. All content &quot;made&quot; by AI currently is just an amalgamation of the real works of human artists, hodge podged together into something &quot;original&quot;, and although some have argued that that&#39;s what artists do, that argument is in bad faith, artists are inspired, AI copies. It isn&#39;t and never will be the same. There is no thought AI has produced, it cannot think, it cannot create in the way an artist can, and it&#39;s nothing less than completely wrong to act like the works AI produces aren&#39;t blatant theft if marked as their own, original, copyrighted content. Theft of intellectual property should not be tolerated, and most certainly shouldn&#39;t be protected under copyright law, for every artist whose art has been stolen and copied by AI, it&#39;s imperative that AI not be considered original work, because at its core, it just isn&#39;t.
