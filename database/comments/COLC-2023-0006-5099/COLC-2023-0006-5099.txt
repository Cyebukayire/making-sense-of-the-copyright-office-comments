Nothing will stop AI from disrupting every industry. It will affect the livelihoods of millions of humans. With this in mind, federal regulation is extremely important. It is critical we get it right. We may only get one chance at getting this right so it&#39;s absolutely vital we understand the end goal and the stakes.<br/><br/>The goal of AI must absolutely be to IMPROVE human lives. If AI succeeds only in increasing corporate profits for the top 1% at the expense of human livelihoods, we will have failed -- the price is too high and the true promise of AI will be lost. AI has the power to increase productivity, lower human hours worked, and increase the standard of living for all humans everywhere. We must reach for this outcome. If humanity suffers in any way because of AI, it is because AI is not regulated correctly. <br/><br/>I adamantly oppose copyrighting AI-created art. There is simply no good reason for it. If that comes to pass, it only serves corporate interests at the expense of human livelihoods. I suggest a 90% of all profits from  AI creations go into a fund to support low income humans -- similar to cigarette tax or a carbon tax.
