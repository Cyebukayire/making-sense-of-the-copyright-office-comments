I really appreciate the Office opening up this comment forum, and allowing the public to comment on this issue. As a history student with many friends that are studying art, the topic of AI art is one that is very important to me. I recently did a paper on government control and how it pertains to social growth patterns and economic mobility, in which I found that the societies that encouraged and supported artists and writers experienced massive surges in cultural and scientific development and overall quality of life. While not directly related to generative AI in the modern day, this paper shaped my views on the subject. I fundamentally believe that AI art discourages creativity and takes job opportunities and support away from real artists, and allowing generative AI to use copyrighted work in training both breaches copyright law and steals from valued artists of the community. Generative AI is an insult to creativity, and the usage of others&rsquo; work to train any such program without permission should be considered illegal within the United States. I hope the Office acts on this, and I thank you for your time.
