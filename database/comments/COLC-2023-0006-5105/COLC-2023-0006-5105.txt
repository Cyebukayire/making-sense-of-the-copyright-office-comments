An algorithm cannot be inspired and it cannot create - by its design it can only take from existing works and put existing ideas and material together in an order it deems most logical based on given parameters. AI creates material by taking parts of existing works (art, voice samples, coding, etc) and compiling them in new orders. This is obscured by the volume of material that is taken from, but the concept is the same. If the works in question do not actively consent to training AI, their copyright is violated in a way that is not considered fair use. AI material trained on consenting works does not violate copyright or IP rights. AI algorithm owners should be required to provide complete public transparency in the works their algorithm has been trained on, including searchable listings, reporting procedures for owners whose works have been used without consent, and tools to remove violating works from the algorithm.
