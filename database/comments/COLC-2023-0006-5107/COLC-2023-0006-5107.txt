Under no circumstances should AI generated images be granted copyright. These image generators were trained on billions of art and works taken from creators without credit, compensation, or consent and are being used to replace creative industries outright. This is unprecedented and prior copyright laws need to be revised. What is occurring now is exploitation of labor. Billions of dollars are being funneled into the hands of these AI companies at the expense of the artists, writers, voice actors, programmers, etc. whose work was taken. There is a major negative impact on mental health in these fields; almost everyday I see artists saying they&#39;re experiencing depression at the thought of their entire livelihoods being destroyed. Already in Japan, there have been multiple artist suicides because they have lost hope for their futures. There is no point to creating anymore when everything you create will just be scraped by these AI companies to use in their datasets to compete with you.<br/><br/>Generative AI also does not learn or create as humans do. It is merely machine learning- a predictive algorithm that creates using calculated probabilities based on the billions of work in its dataset. It therefore should not be allowed to compete with human created works. Additionally, there are major problems associated with these algorithms, including the mass generation of deepfake images, deepfake pornography, and widespread misinformation.<br/><br/>Until these datasets are destroyed and rebuilt using only works that are opt-in only, there must be NO copyright allowed. Opt-out does not work as it is impossible for these algorithms to &quot;forget.&quot;
