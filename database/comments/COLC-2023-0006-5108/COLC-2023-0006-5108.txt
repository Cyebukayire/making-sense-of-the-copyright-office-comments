Modern AI technology has largely been created and maintained through the unauthorized scraping of art, writing, and other works that do no belong to the creators of AI technology, or to its users. No technology that is so reliant on stealing work/labor should be viable to be copyrighted! This is just another way for the tech industry and their most pedantic users to make money off exploiting a public resource to the point of utterly devaluing that resource. AI generated schlock being eligible for copyright is not only absurd, but would render an already hostile marketplace essentially un-livable for independent and underemployed artists and writers.
