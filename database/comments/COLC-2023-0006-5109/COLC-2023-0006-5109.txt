While the usage of AI in creative mediums has the ability to be a genuinely helpful tool in the production of all kinds of art, at its current state the data fed into the AI completely infringes on the intellectual property ownership of many artists around the world. The information fed into databases of AI (whether made for digital art or literary text) should be shown and certified that the proper owners have given their explicit consent in training the AI model with their content. Copyrighting art styles in itself should not be done either. While it may seem like a way to prevent art theft via the use of AI, art styles are fluid and evolve over time. Depending on how vague or specific the defined art style is, there&#39;s many artists whose artworks man or may not fall under the copyrighted art style umbrella. It&#39;s almost impossible to firmly define what constitutes as a specific style versus another, especially in a field like visual art. The creative interpretations inherent to the medium simply cannot be fairly judged in a court of law, as there&#39;s no objective way to determine whether one would count it as a copyright violation or an inspired piece.
