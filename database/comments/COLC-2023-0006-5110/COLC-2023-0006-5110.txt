hi im a hobbiest artist and i enjoy posting what i make online. i don&#39;t want to lie, i dont know much about law, but i do like to think i know a few things about art. art is a creation from the heart. its intent, emotion, and energy mixed together to create a physical (or digital) product. art means something. I&#39;m honestly scared for the future of creative media in the world. machine learning has become advanced enough to create an image based on whatever it learns from. theres a handful of problems with this, mostly stemming from what the machine learns from and how it gets that information. the sources most machine learning algorithms learn from were not submitted and learned from voluntarily. copyright in that regard could be muddied or unfocused. as corporations and large entertainment brands start utilizing machine learning for their scripts, animation, and editing, the jobs that real, breathing people had to fight tooth and nail to hold onto are getting dragged farther and farther away from them. the fact that writers are being replaced by machines is. asinine to be honest. the machine had to learn that writing from somewhere, and therye kicking out the people that it learned from. i just think that&#39;s scary to think about. i dont think machine learning products should be copyrightable. its not their work, its a collection of other peoples&#39; work all smashed together into one gross mess. thank you for listening to my message.
