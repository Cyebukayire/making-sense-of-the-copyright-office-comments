Ai in its current use is as a tool that directly lifts elements from a work, plagiarizing the artists or authors it takes from. This greatly and directly effects the original creators of the works. Artists go through a rigorous process to vet and edit their own works, while ai lifts these works wholecloth from their original sources. Automated algorithms also have a tendency to not incorporate providence as to the source of elements within a work. Providence is incredibly important within art as it provides information on a work so that it may be properly credited and evaluated. As an artist, this effects me and others i know personally because ai makes art theft more easy for fraudulent parties to commit. Artists and writers earn a living through their works and this takes money away from creators.<br/>Another risk is that this plagiarism is not regulated or relegated to specific uses but instead is used as a dangerous &quot;quick fix&quot;, much like placing a piece of scotch tape on a hole in a boat. Use of ai in regards to written advice on an emergency situation may lead to fatal consequences, as ai is merely a string of code without thought, not proportional to logic in a thinking human being.<br/>A line of thought that I&#39;ve seen surrounding ai is that it makes creating an item easier. Unfortunately this is not the case as time and effort still goes into the programming and training of the algorithm plagiarizing these works. I would argue that it makes creating harder as artists now have to figure ways to prevent their works from being stolen, whether through sharing their art in person or placing art behind a paywall- both of which create unique difficulties that further hinder artists.
