Artificial intelligence does not create anything, but merely collects existing work and mixes it together. It is currently doing so without permission from the creators of the original work. What it generates should not only be ineligible for copyright, but there should be legislation against its stealing people&#39;s work, with penalties for doing so, and compensation to victims for theft of their work. It can be compared with doing a remix of an existing song, or forming a song that consists only of samples of other songs. Anyone doing such a thing would not be able to copyright that, and they&#39;d be liable for copyright infringement. As it should be. Creators should be compensated for their work. Thieves should not be.
