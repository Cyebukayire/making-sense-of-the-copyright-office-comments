AI content creation can only function with datasets built from illustrations sourced by human artists who did not give their consent to be added to those datasets. The AI program then creates a &quot;best guess&quot; version of whatever prompts a user gives it by referencing those ill-gotten illustrations.<br/><br/>The purpose of AI content creation is to remove human artists and writers from the equation so that corporations can pilfer their works and generate (not create) content mimicking those art works in order to get around having to pay anybody. One may say that AI content creation is in its infancy, it&#39;s too soon to make such a grim prediction. But it&#39;s become an order of magnitude more effective in less than a year. Whether or not it should be used to put people out of work, it WILL be. And it does this by ignoring copyright. Please don&#39;t give this technology an inch, because it will take a mile and all of our jobs.
