AI generative content, as it currently stands, is theft.  It is stealing from artists and writers who never gave their consent for their data to be scraped and fed to a database.  Therefore copyright for creations that come from AI content should not be copyrightable.  There are some that are able to mimic the style of specific artists or write in a specific style.  The people entering prompts into these generators gave comparatively no creative input vs an artist who expends a great amount of creativity and effort to make the piece.  Such a result would be an exploitation of artists and writers and put many out of work in the process and therefore should not be given even the slightest amount of approval.
