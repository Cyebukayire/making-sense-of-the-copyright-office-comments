In the field of generative AI, there boils down to two major issues that come into play. The first of these is copyright factor. In the same way that one can&#39;t simply copyright, say, Niagara Falls or the Great Barrier Reef, AI generated imagery should also not fall into that category on account of the image itself being made by machine, not by man. While it can be argued that the prompt should be copyrightable, that too imposes a problem on account of image generation being at random, not a set image every time a prompt is written. Prompts are not the same sort of deal as, perhaps, a Minecraft seed where every aspect of the world is the same every time that a generarive seed is written.<br/><br/>The second problem comes with artistic integrity and how it affects the medium of creativity. As seen with the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers&#39; Guild of America, their strikes, among other factors, primarily delve into the issue of generative AI and its uses in screenwriting/acting. One request that studio executives had made was for permission to use background actors&#39; likeness through AI permanently. If allowed, this would result in hundreds of actors, background or otherwise, to be forced out of a job. Furthermore, voice actors and writers also run this same risk as generative AI has been trialed and used in the industry of video games, almost always without the permission of those writers and voice actors. Allowing this unfiltered usage would strip these workers of their own autonomy and income they&#39;d otherwise get out of their work. I encourage Congress to take action on this despite the lobbying efforts of studios like Disney or Discovery.
