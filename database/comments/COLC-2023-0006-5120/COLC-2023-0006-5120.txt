All AI Engines have been built upon theft.  No one gave permission for AI to scrape the internet, no artist gave permission for their art to be stolen, voice actors for their voices to be taken or writer&#39;s for their words to be ripped from their hands.  <br/><br/>Nothing should ever be given copywrite that is based on theft.  Why would we give the outputs of AI copyright when it scraped the Mona Lisa?<br/><br/>Not to mention the amount of jobs and the impact upon the economy by shutting down artist and creative jobs.  Thousands upon millions will be out of work, hitting the economy hard, especially in things like welfare and homeless rates.
