AI content is theft, and can be straight-up dangerous (see: mushroom foraging guides generated by AI that may advise foragers to eat mushrooms that are actually poisonous). <br/>AI devalues actual art that takes effort, and sets impossible standards for actual artists to compete with (for example, a picture of an AI generated carving may have details that are physically impossible for an actual artist to create with physical materials). <br/>Allowing AI users to copyright pieces generated by an AI that scraped copyrighted works without the consent of their owners would be nonsensical, and would absolutely deincentivize creating original work.
