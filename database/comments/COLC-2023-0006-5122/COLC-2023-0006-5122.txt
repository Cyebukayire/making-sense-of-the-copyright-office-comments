The largest AI models of today use data that does not belong to the operators---images and writing owned and copyrighted by internet users. Posting text and images on the internet does not relinquish copyright claim. Generative AI models that scrape the wider internet for data are trained on this copyrighted data. Data defines the model, and when labelled in supervised training, it then becomes possible to &quot;recreate&quot; the work of an author, artist, or other figure with copyrighted work on the internet. AI work CANNOT be copyrighted unless the dataset belongs to the creators of the model. If the data fed into the model belongs to others, the data is stolen and the AI work is a result of theft.
