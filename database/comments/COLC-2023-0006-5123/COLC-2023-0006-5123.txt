I am a member of the Writer&#39;s Guild of America. I felt compelled to comment on this issue as I view Artificial Intelligence as an existential threat to my work as a writer and to the TV and Film industry as we know it. The issues surrounding AI are far deeper, but I will focus my comments to my own domain. Currently AI models are being trained on work created by human labor, yet the humans who have performed the labor to create these works are uncompensated, nor are the creators of this content asked for permission to use their works to train AI models. No one envisioned this future, therefore there are no clauses to protect one&#39;s work from being exploited by machine learning. This not only devalues that work, but it also devalues all future work because a human is no longer needed in the supply chain. It is a fundamentally different issue than any copyright issue in the past.<br/><br/>It is therefore unethical to use any copyrighted material to train an AI system without explicit consent and compensation for the copyright holder. The AI is using these works to regurgitate content. It may create something that is seemingly novel, but it is dependent on someone else&#39;s labor to do so. I feel that the shiny features of &quot;new technology&quot; obscures the basic function at work here. The AI would not exist without copyrighted content being fed into it, yet the tech industry would prefer to use labels such as &quot;data&quot; and &quot;information,&quot; to obfuscate the fact that this content is the work of human labor. It is a kind of theft.<br/><br/>The other issue is whether AI content can be copyrightable, and I say emphatically NO! A Large Language Model that weighs words on probabilities can hardly be considered an author. Can an algorithm be an author? Is it alive? Does it possess a consciousness? No. Again, the LLMs can only reproduce content based on the work of humans being fed into it. It is not an author in the sense it is not an originator. Even if the AI creates a seemingly novel piece of fiction for example, what is the legal entity that performed this labor? What is the legal entity that is the owner of this content? Is it the company that created the AI? The engineers who developed it? No. It makes virtually no sense. The engineers have nothing to do with the creation of the content, only the creation of the machine that spits it out. At best, the content produced by AI is a product of &quot;collective knowledge.&quot; And at worst, it is simply a remix of human labor, repackaged so that the tech company can profit instead of the workers. Allowing AI content to be copyrightable would destroy the future of writing as a livelihood.<br/><br/>The ramifications of unchecked AI ownership is hard to put into words, but I think it would be the end of most artistic industries and pursuits (for humans) and would leave our culture in a dehumanized state where stories no longer provide meaning, dreams, and hope, but simply distraction from the mundane. Without the impetus for humans to create writing - i.e. the ability to pursue it as a livelihood - my fear is we may lose this ability like a vestigial organ, or an atrophied, unused muscle. And at that point there would really be no turning back. <br/><br/>I am asking you to protect copyright holders from having their work exploited by Large Language Models without consent. And I am asking you to make it impossible for an AI generated content to by copyrightable.
