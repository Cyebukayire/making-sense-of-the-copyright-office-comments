I think the most important question is whether or not training data should be considered &quot;fair use,&quot; I think it shouldn&#39;t because the models output replaces to some extent the very thing that art was trying to achieve, which was to express aesthetics and/or produce an aesthetic product. This undermines the profit incentive from creative works and severely will harm the motivation to produce intellectual property in the future and will harm American culture for it. I strongly urge generative AI training models be required to license and compensate the producers of training data used in these models like a type of stock image model.
