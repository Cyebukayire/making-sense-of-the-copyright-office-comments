Generative AI frequently scrapes copyrighted material, violating intellectual property rights by collecting and reproducing copyrighted text, images, or other media without proper authorization. This disregard for copyright laws undermines the financial interests and creative efforts of content creators. To address this issue effectively, it is essential to establish and enforce robust copyright enforcement mechanisms and AI-specific regulations that mandate responsible data and content usage by AI systems.
