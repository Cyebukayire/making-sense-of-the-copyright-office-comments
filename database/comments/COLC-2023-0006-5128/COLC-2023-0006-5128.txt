One of the issues raised by this inquiry is whether works generated by A.I. should be licensed.  I think that a mandatory disclosure on works generated by A.I. saying that they were generated by A.I. would be enough to ensure that I don&rsquo;t read them.  Conversely, I think the issue of licensing works TO A.I. very important, and would support some kind of collective licensing scheme that would involve some sort of remuneration to the authors of copyrighted work who assent to having their work used to train A.I. models.  There is to my knowledge draft language to this effect being circulated among members of Congress.  Even thornier an issue is social media and web sites being scraped to train A.I. models.  I hope this inquiry looks into the rights of privacy and publicity in those cases.
