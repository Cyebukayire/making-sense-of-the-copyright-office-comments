Allegations that artificial intelligence systems &quot;steal&quot; copyrighted material during training are misleading. The machine learning algorithms used extract statistical patterns from data - they do not replicate or appropriate creative expression in any way.<br/>Similarly, the outputs generated by AI are not inherently infringing on copyrights. While influenced by its training, outputs are transformative and represent original expression produced at a user&#39;s prompt. AI systems lack intentionality or capacity to autonomously infringe protections.<br/>Claims that AI is &quot;theft&quot; anthropomorphize the technology, ascribing human behaviors that do not apply. Both training and generation represent transformative computational processes, not simple duplication of existing works.<br/>AI holds significant potential for driving innovation and progress if developed responsibly. Balanced policy is needed to address substantiated risks without limiting advancement based on exaggerated claims. I advocate for solution-oriented governance rooted in the actual functional realities of artificial intelligence, not metaphorical tropes that fail to accurately describe the technology&#39;s workings.<br/>Let us work together to nurture AI&#39;s benefits while protecting against harms.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Michael
