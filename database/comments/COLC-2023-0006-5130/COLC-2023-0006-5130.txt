AI is theft. It doesn&#39;t create out of it&#39;s own it heavily steals from existing work. It is not used to create original styles or even works. In most cases it is used to recreate the art/voice/writing of a specific creator who put in a lot of work to hone their craft. So this is pure disrespect towards the original creators of said art/voice/writing work these AI take samples from creators without their knowledge or consent.
