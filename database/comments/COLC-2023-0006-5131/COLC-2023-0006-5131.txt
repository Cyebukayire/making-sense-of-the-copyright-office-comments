<br/>Copyright was created to protect humans and their work, their rights and their creativity and thus supporting their livelihoods. By granting copyright to works of GAI you are allowing a cesspool of neverending trash content to fill, not only our entertainment industry, but our whole information sector.<br/>Currently, we are seeing artists, writers, actors and all connected jobs in those industries scared that they will be obsolete because of likeness-theft, causing mental distress and trauma. Even pornographic content (also of children) has been produced using these machines. These are just a few examples of what is already going on and what will likely only grow more severe unless taken seriously.<br/>Should we not value human expressiveness over machines? People need to live, put food on the table - this is why we have rights unlike a copy machine.<br/>
