Currently, a vast majority of AI images are not taken from public domain but instead stolen from artists without their knowledge or consent which is a violation of their exclusive right that has been promised to them by law.<br/><br/>I sincerely believe AI works should be profitable *for* artists instead of against them. One that pays the creators of the works it uses fairly, preferably generously, as otherwise it would be exploitation of workers without their knowledge or consent. Therefore if the AI programm does not uphold these conditions, should be given a fine for the same reasons.<br/><br/>Even stricter laws should be upheld for using voices as it will lead to impersonation and fraud. Both acts are criminal offenses and once again, AI should only use voices from public domains, rather than illegally using someone else&#39;s without permission. In the same vein taking a photo of someone and publishing it without their knowledge is punishable by law, so should any and all AI work that does the same.
