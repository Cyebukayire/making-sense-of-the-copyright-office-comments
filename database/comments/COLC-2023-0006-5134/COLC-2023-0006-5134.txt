 AI should not be allowed to scrape the art of unwilling artists without explicit permission and/or compensation. This is because its use financially benefits the owner of the AI using intellectual property directly. It is not the equivalent of inspiration as some AI shills would have you believe, as the work of actual artists is being used for profit without consent.<br/><br/>AI voices and likenesses should not be legal without the owner of the voice&#39;s consent and compensation, or that of their surviving family members should they be dead. I find it odd that this is even a debate, as it is direct use of a person&#39;s identity, again for profit, without permission. Contracts requiring that actors allow their likenesses and voices to be used already exist, and are extremely predatory in nature.
