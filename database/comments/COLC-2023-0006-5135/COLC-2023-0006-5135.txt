Generative Ai is a new technology that companies have been using to get around copyright protections since its inception and these protections need to be updated for the modern age.<br/><br/>When a company can fund a research endeavor that scans billions of images of copyrighted data ranging from paintings to peoples personal medical records, and even an individuals voice....to then turn around and lets another company use that &quot;research data&quot; for commercial use, that is a breach of the entire purpose of copyright.<br/><br/>Copyright is designed to protect a creators work and allow them to decide how it is utilized. We have however entered an era where Ai companies are trying to lie to the public about how their technology works. They seek to anthropomorphize the technology and obfuscate how their software is trained. Currently a company can hide their training data entirely. When the data is transparent we find that in reality the Ai&#39;s DO in fact retain scanned copyrighted data when we were told that &quot;it learns just like us&quot;.<br/><br/>We have voice actors and singers that had their voices fed to a machine to make them say whatever a user desires. We have painters that have their entire portfolio fed to a machine so a user can replicate an image with their skills without compensating them. These technologies will continue to feed upon copyrighted data unless stopped and create an era of cultural/creative stagnation that will affect individuals and markets as a whole.
