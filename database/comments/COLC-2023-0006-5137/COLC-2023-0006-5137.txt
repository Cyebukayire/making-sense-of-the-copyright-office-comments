With the current state of generative AI, the program receives input from many artists or authors and then generates work based on the learned styles. Anything that AI creates is then the product of the work of the artists and authors used as reference points. AI should be allowed to continue to grow and produce new art, but the authors and artists it&rsquo;s using should be credited and paid. Any work created by an AI and sold for profit should have to split said profit with the creators it&rsquo;s stealing it&rsquo;s work from.
