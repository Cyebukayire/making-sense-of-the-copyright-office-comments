AI scraping of copyrighted works is of enormous concern to me, as a working artist. Many artists and creators rely without thought on the protections automatically offered by copyright law over their original work simply once it has been created. When AI systems indiscriminately (or not so indiscriminately: some AI systems have deliberately chosen to scrape the image data off of artist or creator-centric websites or databases, where there is no good faith argument available that the images or material in question is not copyrighted material) integrate copyrighted material into their algorithms, they are stealing that material. They, it may even be said, are stealing the future creativity of individual creators. <br/><br/>&#39;Create an image of [x] in the style of [artist]&#39; or &#39;Artwork in the style of [artist]&#39; or &#39;Write a story in the style of [author]&#39; are not edge-case prompts that are never used to prompt AI generated material-&mdash;in fact, they are some of the most common style of prompts. I have seen incidents where artists have to battle &#39;fake&#39; works which are AI-generated, including in cases where those who prompted the AI image generation have been attempting to sell those works. These fakes can be very plausible imitations of the artist&#39;s style, and can fool even long-time fans of the artist. When I say this kind of incident steals the future creativity of an artist, what I mean is that an artist may be deprived of the opportunity or even the motivation to make future work that too closely matches the AI fakes. Imagine: Picasso, about to enter his blue period, and someone prompts an image generator to create a suite of images &#39;in the style of Picasso, but with a blue color scheme&#39;. These images would not be real works of Picasso, and, deprived of all the intricacies of mind and material that go into the creation of an artwork, they would not have the same meaning, but they still might serve to poison the artist in question against that work, or to poison others against any &#39;blue period&#39; Picasso pursued afterwards. &#39;You&#39;re just copying what the AI did,&#39; says the unforgiving public. <br/><br/>Even if all prompts of the form &#39;in the style of&#39; were successfully forbidden, AI databases based on copyrighted material would still be violating that copyright. <br/><br/>AI is not a mind. AI is not making novel connections between disparate things. AI is a tool of pure imitation. Imitation taken to unreal extremes, at an enormous scale, but simply, imitation. Imitation which actively harms the livelihoods and even the creativity of artists who are imitated. Imitation of copyrighted material is plagiarism. <br/><br/>I do not believe that any image or creative work generated by an AI system that has integrated copyrighted material can be copyrighted in its own right. This may seem unfair, and I am sympathetic to those creatives who are attempting to use AI constructively, but I think it must be clear that unless an AI system can prove that it has not integrated copyrighted material, that any material generated by it cannot be copyrighted. <br/><br/>Even if the above point is disputed, I believe it must be even more clear that AI systems themselves, when they have integrated copyrighted material of any kind, cannot be copyrighted entities unto themselves. Imitation of copyrighted material is plagiarism, and each of these AI systems which has scraped copyrighted material is built out of building blocks made of the unadulterated, indisputably copyrighted material of other creators. Once scraped, these copyrighted works become an indissoluble part of the AI algorithm. The algorithm is made out of whatever it scrapes. That data is fundamental to its function and is a fundamental part of what differentiates it from other algorithms. <br/><br/>The code which organizes the data, or which originates the AI, could be a copyrighted work. However, because of the &#39;learning&#39; element of AI &#39;training&#39;, once the copyrighted data has been integrated, the AI itself can no longer be treated as an original work. <br/><br/>For analogy, we may say that a certain method of preparing photo papers can be copyrighted (patented). However, once a photo has been printed on the paper, that photograph is not somehow enfolded under the patent or copyright of the kind of paper, it&#39;s own copyright is intact regardless of the substrate on which it sits. For another analogy, an artist who buys an old painting from a thrift store is buying a painting that may be under copyright. When the artist completely destroys the old painting, whether by covering it or by removing old paint with solvents, and then paints a new work, the new work does not become copyrighted to the first artist. <br/><br/>In the same way, an AI system which has placed copyrighted material upon its scaffold cannot enfold that external copyrighted material within the copyright of its scaffold. Therefore, because the AI scaffold and the material upon it are indissoluble, the whole entity cannot be copyrighted.
