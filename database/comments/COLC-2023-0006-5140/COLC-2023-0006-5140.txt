Good Afternoon,<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to receive feedback on the topic of Generative AI. To begin I recognize that there are reasonable applications for this technology be it in pursuit of scientific research, medical advancement and national security. I do not oppose using this technology for our collective good. <br/><br/>What I do oppose, however, is the weaponization and exploitation of this technology by companies like OpenAI &amp; Midjourney and their user base. <br/><br/>This technology has been used to create pornographic material of private citizens and public figures alike, it has been used towards the dissemination of disinformation meant to further blur the lines between fact and fiction which will make it virtually impossible for the public to determine what is fact and what is fiction. How can we as a democratic society function in a world when anyone can fabricate a picture, audio recording or video indistinguishable from the real thing? How does a government, a business or an individual protect their reputation? There are to many ways this technology can be used for harm and not enough understanding on how to mitigate that harm.<br/><br/>As a professional creative I am also obviously concerned about the rampant disregard for the intellectual property and copyright of creatives across the nation and in every industry. Artists, musicians, actors, programmers, all of us are finding our works copied and used to train machine learning algorithms that are being used to siphon off employment opportunities or displace us entirely. We are not only forced to compete with ourselves, but the combined skills and talents of everyone these programs have been trained on. Isn&#39;t the point of copyright to protect us from this? To ensure that we retain the rights to our works that we might benefit from the fruits of our own labor? These programs literally take our work, our voices, our very likeness and turns them against us.<br/><br/>These companies seek to take our skills, our talents, our labor to enrich themselves without any form of consent, much less compensation for what they have stolen from us and they want to ensure they can continue to do so. The professional, psychological and emotional distress and harm this has caused us goes beyond words. We struggle to see a future where we can survive and thrive doing what we love; sharing stories, wonder and beauty with everyone alive today and everyone who will come after.<br/><br/>I understand that there may be no going back to a pre-GenAI world but it is not too late to enact laws and regulations that can ensure that this technology can be used for the common good and mitigate the potential for harm. This can be achieved by outlawing the reckless scraping methods used to feed the data sets that power these programs and the destruction of data sets engorged with stolen content. Enforcing opt-in only models would also go a long way to not only to protect creatives, but the public as well by ensuring that everything used as training material is acquired through consent and with compensation. That the onus for removing unauthorized content us on the organizations that operate and maintain these services. This and similar limitations would curb the scope and scale of malicious applications and abuse of this technology.<br/><br/>I implore the government of the United States of America to protect us from this dystopian future in which everything we make is no longer ours to benefit from but rendered up for grabs by those who would turn our life&#39;s work into cheap, readily available, consumables devoid of human touch or meaning for their own profit. To protect the public from companies that have recklessly turn the entire public into beta testers for a technology not even they fully understand. We cannot assume they will ever amend there ways on their own, that they will cease the theft and exploitation until the powers of the state force them to do so.<br/><br/>All I ask is for our government to do right by us, to ensure that we are afforded a fair shake and a future worth living for. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and attention.
