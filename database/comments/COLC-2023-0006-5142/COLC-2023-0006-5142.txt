Hello! As an aspiring author I really appreciate the comments being opened up; it&#39;s great to have a say in all this.<br/><br/>It&#39;s my strong belief that generative AI should not be allowed to train on copyrighted works. As I mentioned I&#39;m an aspiring author, as well as being an artist, and if someone else used my work, without my permission, to train a machine for their own gain, I would be devastated. It would be taking away potential sales - if a potential customer could choose between a more expensive, but human-made piece of art, or a cheap, AI piece of art, then 9 times out of 10 they will go for the cheaper option. So many people - myself included - need to sell our art to make a living, and AI art training off of our hard work and taking away potential sales is already ruining livelihoods.<br/><br/>Furthermore, AI writing has the potential to be incredibly dangerous. I have seen multiple examples of AI-generated &#39;foraging&#39; books being sold, proclaiming to teach about what wild foods are safe to eat - except that the information is completely made up, with nonexistent plants and even poisonous plants being touted as &#39;safe&#39;. While I thankfully haven&#39;t heard of anyone getting hurt from this yet, it is incredibly concerning that these books can even exist in the first place.<br/><br/>And my final comment is that AI is just so incredibly invasive. I want to be able to show people my art and writing, I want them to be able to enjoy it and share feedback, and I want to read and look at their own works - but nowadays, I am too scared to, because I don&#39;t want some shady AI stealing the data from it. It&#39;s honestly just frustrating at this point. It&#39;s my opinion that creating art, no matter what form it may take, is the essence of humanity - something that an artifical intelligence is decidely not. One of the oldest forms of human expression is being stifled by the fear of it being scraped by something we artists haven&#39;t had a say in (until now, that is!).<br/><br/>Thank you again for opening these comments; I hope you take these points into consideration. It means a lot to small artists and writers like myself.
