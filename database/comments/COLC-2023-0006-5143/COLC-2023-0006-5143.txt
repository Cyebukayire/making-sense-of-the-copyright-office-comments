I believe that AI is a work of theft. It is a compilation of others hard work put into different orders. There needs to be consent from the artists/authors to use there work to help the machine learn, because otherwise it is stealing. The artists have copyrights on their work and should be allowed to take legal action against those who don&rsquo;t ask permission.
