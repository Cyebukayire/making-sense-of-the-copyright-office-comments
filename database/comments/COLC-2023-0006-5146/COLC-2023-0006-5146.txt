Ai, especially generative AI is the epitome of mass theft of all creatives in many fields. It robs them of their own copyright, art, voices, and uses that to compete in the same market as those creatives. This exploitation threatens to push hundreds of thousands of artists out of work. There should be no copyright given to a program that is reliant upon theft of images and audio and the data associated with it. More should be done to counter this theft, but in short AI should NOT have copyright protections as the output is based on stolen data, with little to no human input.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
