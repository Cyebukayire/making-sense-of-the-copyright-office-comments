I am concerned with the idea of AI works being copyrightable, given the generative nature of them and how many of the models are built on the works of other people who did not agree to be included, were not compensated, and will not be credited. It seems to me that allowing AI work to be able to attain a copyright would be against the purpose of copyright. Generative work is not intellectual property by nature; it is an amalgamation of many people&rsquo;s IP, usually. It should not be allowed to attain copyright, because there is nothing unique to it, nothing original to it, and it lacks any soul of creation that would be found in art, music, literature, likenesses, etc.. If one could not obtain copyright for a scrapbook of the IP of someone else&mdash;for instance, Disney characters&mdash;then one should not be able to copyright work that is in essence ripping off the work of creatives. Someone should have the exclusive right to their own work unless they choose to license it fairly. AI work does not allow for those fair licenses to happen due to the nature of its models. Even if someone were to make a new model, and they somehow managed to get consent from every author of the work they used to train their model, they&rsquo;d be basing it on current exploitative models that lack any spirit of creation or respect of IP. If it matters so little to them that artists are respected, then why should they get rights that they&rsquo;ve denied someone else? AI by nature violates copyright law constantly; how can it be determined that they have any rights of IP when they themselves do not own any of the IP used to generate? They&rsquo;re not making work inspired by that of others, they&rsquo;re directly ripping it off for themselves, violating the original creators&rsquo; copyrights on their work when they have them.
