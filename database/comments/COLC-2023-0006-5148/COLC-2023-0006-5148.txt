Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a digital tool that takes hundreds of inputs, finds patterns in the data that can be subjected to negative biases, and then spits out an average with just enough variation in order to be unique. It reduces artistic creation to a mechanical process, robbing humans of the opportunity to challenge themselves and create something with meaning. Machine learning specifically is incredibly flawed and will only hurt humans in the long run without clear guidelines for how and when it is appropriate and ethical to use.
