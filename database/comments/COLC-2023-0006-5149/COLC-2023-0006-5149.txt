Generative AI stands to bring no improvement to the lives of artists or creatives in general. It is a tool of theft, plain and simple, and exists to do only that. It is proven that it cannot create content on its own without data being fed to it. It is inherently parasitic and benefits no one, except the people who develop it. Those very people will work tirelessly to silence creative, spreading misinformation and falsely victimizing themselves to avoid any accountability or sanction over their theft. They are untrustworthy, their algorithms must be heavily regulated or outright banned.
