Many AI generators were created by data scraping copyrighted art without any notice/credit/compensation. To say anything generated from that is wholly original would be false. The way that the images/etc are then also used to avoid paying people who make art is disgusting. The way we all use the phrase &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; for this technology implies that this technology is &#39;smart&#39; or machine generated, but it&#39;s trained and influenced by the work of skilled human workers, and benefits only the people who profit of the world of those workers. We have to protect the rights of the artists who made this technology possible before the rights of the people who want to profit from them.
