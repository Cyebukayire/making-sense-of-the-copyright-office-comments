It&rsquo;s just plain lazy to rely on computer generation for adequate storytelling. AI cannot capture the human experience, cannot portray the things the same as a human individual can. Also, where will copyright step in if AI generates the same story over and over? Seems like a legal mess waiting to happen. Let writers write, let actors act, let humans create and portray human experiences. It&rsquo;s not a job for AI.
