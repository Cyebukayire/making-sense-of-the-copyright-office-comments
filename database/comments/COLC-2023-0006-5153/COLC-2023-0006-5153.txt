AI, notably generative AI, is an existential threat to the Internet at large, and by extension it is a threat the economy and human culture. <br/><br/>Generative Artificial Intelligence is known to mass produce unreliable data in a vague style of the original. Be it in visual arts, literature, music, or code, if it&#39;s on the internet, AI can and is at present being used to create limitless un-usable alterations of information that is hard to dispell as being fake. <br/><br/>This limitless mass production of slightly-different clones of data is making the Internet a rapidly unreliable place for nearly all purposes. Websites such as Amazon are being filled with AI generated products. Research is increasingly difficult to due AI overtaking the space through sheer quantity. Important information that can be used for purposes such as survival is being forced to compete with AI.<br/><br/>In addition, AI is being built off of the data of millions to be used against the very same people that it took from. Artists, musicians, writers, and coders are being forced to compete against those who took from them. The sheer scale of the automation of the arts should be enough to warrant banning AI, but the addition of it being created through the theft of people&#39;s works makes it far worse. <br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence and it&#39;s &quot;creations&quot; should never be allowed to hold nor use copyright. It is theft and a threat to humanity. Artificial Intelligence poses to be a Gray Goo scenario for the internet, overflooding the shared space that connects the world with useless, fake, and misleading data.
