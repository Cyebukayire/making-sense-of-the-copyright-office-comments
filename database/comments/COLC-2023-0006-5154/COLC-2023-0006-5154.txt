I am an artist. Like many other artists, my work was used &ndash; with neither permission nor compensation &ndash; to train AI datasets. If copyright begins at the time a work is created, then this is a clear and blatant violation of copyright, and works deriving from those datasets is in direct violation of the copyright I hold over my work. Not only is it copyright violation, it is theft, as people are using AI to create works they then sell for a profit and the original artists, musicians, actors, writers, etc &ndash; whose work is the BACKBONE of these AI models &ndash; are not seeing a single cent for the work they originated. <br/><br/>Many may say that the floodgates are open, etc. However, there is no reason we need to let it continue like this. AI models can be retrained. Artists (and musicians, writers, etc.) can and should be able to a) opt-in and b) be compensated for the use of their original works. Those &quot;creating&quot; derivative works from AI should be paying original creators to license the work that was used to train the models, the way they would through any stock licensing site, and without that permission and financial compensation, should not be able to use said products commercially or profit directly from them. Please listen more to creators than the inventors of these AI models, who clearly disregarded copyrighting, licensing, and consent.
