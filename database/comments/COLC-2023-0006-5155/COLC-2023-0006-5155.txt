AI is causing severe and devastating problems to artists of all kinds. People who draw, write, voice act, etc. are all having their work used to train AI without their consent, in essence stealing their work. The artists don&#39;t ever get credited or paid, and the AI users who generate content with what they&#39;d gained claim credit for it. Without regulation, it is causing serious damage to artists all over the world. This cannot be allowed to continue. There needs to be regulations on what AI is allowed to be trained off of and consequences for failing to follow through proper routes. There needs to be consequences for stealing artists&#39; work. With the progression of AI being so prominent lately, it needs to be kept in check.
