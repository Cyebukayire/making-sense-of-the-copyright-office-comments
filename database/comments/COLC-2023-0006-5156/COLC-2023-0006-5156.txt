I am a voiceover artist. Nearly every job is now requiring me to sign away my digital likeness in order to be hired. I have no recourse currently. There are hundreds of apps and websites with my voice and my peers that other creatives can download. Some even require paid subscriptions. We did not consent to this nor are we getting paid. Some places offer to take them down, but it is a game of whack a mole trying to find them daily. Other places like Eleven Labs say we do not own the rights to our voice, and that it is owned by the game company or animation studio that recorded us, so they will not honor any actors requests. Several of my peers have been doxed with fake profiles and audio of AI versions of their voice saying highly offensive things (racial slurs, crass sexual comments). Members of my family have been scammed out of thousands of dollars from someone using an AI voice of a family member calling pretending to need money. If you cannot copyright an AI likeness, it is a deterrent from companies trying to steal people&#39;s likeness and use for a profit.
