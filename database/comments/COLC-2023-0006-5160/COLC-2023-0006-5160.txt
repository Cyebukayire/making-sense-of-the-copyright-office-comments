I am a person who has published free books and stories on the internet for the entertainment of other people. I have also officially copyrighted the longer works through copyright.gov. At the time, my general worry was that my stories might be &#39;scraped&#39; and republished for profit without my knowledge or permission, and I saw copyright as a way to protect myself against that. However, my stories are now almost certainly being used without my permission and I do not have any real recourse.<br/><br/>It is not happening in the way I expected - I was expecting the stories to be stolen in their entirety, not fed piecemeal to an AI - but it is still happening. The large corporations who are invested in AI technology could afford to pay writers to write millions of pages of copyright-free text to be officially fed to their AIs, but instead, they are using text that does not belong to them and was never meant to be used in this way.<br/><br/>I do not believe that we should allow the use of stolen copyrighted material in the training of AIs. I also do not believe that we should allow AI-generated text and works to be copyrightable. If, some day in the far future, the AIs become actual sentient beings that require this sort of protection, then yes, allow them copyright permissions then. That is certainly not the issue now!
