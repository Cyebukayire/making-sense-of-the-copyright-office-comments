As someone deeply enmeshed in the realm of storytelling, the U.S. Copyright Office&#39;s recent notice on AI and copyright brings forth a narrative that may define our future. As a writer who staunchly believes in the open and free exchange of ideas, I thought I&#39;d share my musings.<br/><br/>1. Use of Copyrighted Works to Train AI Models:<br/>Words and ideas are meant to be sowed like seeds, not hoarded like treasures. AI, when trained on copyrighted works, serves as a garden where these seeds can flourish into something unique. Do we not, as humans, do the same&mdash;each of us a confluence of the many stories, facts, and experiences we&#39;ve gathered? To claim exclusive rights over the training material would be akin to stunting the growth of a garden that promises unprecedented blooms.<br/><br/>2. Levels of Transparency and Disclosure:<br/>In art and construction, do we demand artists to reveal the brushes they used or builders to list every tool employed? The creative journey often involves unspoken collaborations between the artist and their tools. To mandate overt disclosure would be to ignore the silent, yet potent, dialogue that propels creativity forward.<br/><br/>3. Legal Status of AI-Generated Outputs:<br/>Assigning exclusive ownership to AI-generated works will turn them into chains rather than the wings they ought to be. It risks turning the landscape into a battlefield of claims and counterclaims, draining time, money, and emotional energy, and ultimately stifling creativity. As such, AI-generated content should belong to the commons, open for everyone to partake and build upon.<br/><br/>4. Mimicking Personal Attributes of Human Artists:<br/>We live in an era of unprecedented change, and both artists and AI are a part of this transformation. The attempt to mimic or reproduce personal attributes is a non-issue; we cannot capture the ephemeral spark that ignites an artist&rsquo;s unique vision, nor can we predict what shape AI will take in the future.<br/><br/>As we press on into the future, let us choose paths that foster an ecosystem of free-flowing ideas and collaborative innovation. The narrative around AI and copyright is still being written, and it is up to us to ensure it unfolds as a tale of collective enlightenment rather than one of divisive entanglements.
