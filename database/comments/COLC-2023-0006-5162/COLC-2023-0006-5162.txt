1.) In regards to AI using copywriten information I believe that training an AI model is the same as a human reading a book; the AI models are NOT reproducing the copywritten material so they should not be held in violation of any Copyrights.<br/><br/>2.) In regards to the content produced by an AI model since the information is derived from many public sources regardless of how unique the output is, the output should be placed into the public domain and not able to be copywritten by any organization or individual.<br/><br/>3.) In reagard to how copyright liability would work with AI everything in or out of an AI model should be public domain this not only prevents legal entanglements but also allows for future innovations without the pressure or possibilities of legal issues surrounding copyrights and AI.  AI should be free to all humans providing the greatest innovations and preventing only companies with the deepest pockets to benefit from the results of AI in their organizations. I do believe there is room for the individual models themselves to be able to be copywriter under a software copyright but once again any output would be unable to be copywritten.<br/><br/>Thank you
