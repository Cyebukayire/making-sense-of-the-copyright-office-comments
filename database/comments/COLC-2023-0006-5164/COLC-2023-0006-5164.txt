The &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; title for what this is touted around as is a misconception. This is just devices set up to monitor and recognize patterns in popular media that other people exercise labor on creating. It then takes those works and creates its own rendition by mixing and combining recognizable features to create &quot;content&quot;. Allowing this to proceed at its rate of progression would only spell struggle and misery for artists and creators in all aspects of life. All of this is done, like most things nowadays, from a standard of financial gain above all else. It&#39;s put into place as a means of creating &quot;content&quot; for consumption from the masses in a short amount of time with less cost involved by not hiring or contracting actual artists. It does not uphold enough ground to be recognized on the same level as those that put forth effort to create something beautiful, entertaining, and/or thought-provoking. <br/><br/>You will have many comments that will all say generally the same thing and make better, more specific points of argument. It is important to distinguish from the notion of &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; and procedurally generated content. Then it is important to realize that this is purely to make quick bucks, not all that different from the notions of Cryptocurrencies and &quot;NFTs&quot;. There is no desire from those that propagate this facade of what they believe to be art. It is not art, it is content.
