Hello,<br/><br/>As an author who relies on my written work to provide a living for myself, I am naturally very concerned about the use of copy written work for trailing AI systems without the creator&rsquo;s express consent. The Copyright Act has protected creators and their rights for years, and is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the artistic community. As someone who has worked to create my own unique style and voice over the course of years, the idea that an AI program could scrape my work and use it for the gain of someone else, all without my knowledge and consent, is a clear violation of my rights, and, frankly, theft. <br/><br/>AI should be restricted to learning from either Public Domain works, like everyone else, or acquiring the specific consent of the creator&rsquo;s whose work it seeks to profit from. <br/><br/>I believe that AI can be a powerful tool that can help shape society for the better, but it must be handled responsibly in a way that does not violate both the law and the public&rsquo;s trust. <br/><br/>I believe the Copyright Office should find that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates both of these things.
