The work that is generated  through AI is compiled via the words and thoughts of other people and includes no individual/personal experience or perspective. To profit from it and particularly to copyright it should be plagiarism. The sole purpose of a copyright for an AI generated work would be for corporations and people who did not create the work to profit from it without having to provide any compensation to an actual creator (the real human beings who are responsible for anything an AI program comes up with).
