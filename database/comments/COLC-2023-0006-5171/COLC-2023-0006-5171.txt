Generative AI is no more than the theft of all creative artists. Built by scraping websites and using that work without compensation to the creators, it robs them of their copyright.  In no way should AI be allowed to train their algorithms without knowledge and compensation to the artists.  AI should not be allowed any copyright status, what so ever, as it is the result of an amalgamation of stolen work.
