AI as it is currently structured is a tool created by theft, continued by theft, that is incapable of being held accountable. This is bad. It should not be used. If it IS used, because it is created by theft, the results should not be able to be copyrighted. As someone whose works have been scraped by AI, I am very mad about people stealing my work without my consent to train bias-machines.
