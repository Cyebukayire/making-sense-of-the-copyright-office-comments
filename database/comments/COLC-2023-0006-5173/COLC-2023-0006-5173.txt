Current AI programs have been created and trained though the theft of millions of artist and creatives online without they&#39;re knowledge or consent. Anything produced though programs such as these should not be copyrightable. To allow anyone to do so would be allowing the death of the arts.<br/><br/>Any AI programs in the future to be used for image generation or otherwise needs to be trained in a closed system by people who have given their express consent for their works to be used for this purpose, as well as requiring tracking and easily accessible listing of people&#39;s works used. The ask for this consent should always require an active, separate, &quot;opt-in&quot; as well and not a passive one as some company&#39;s have tried to hide in contracts and terms of service.
