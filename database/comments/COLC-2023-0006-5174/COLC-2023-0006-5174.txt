In My Opinion, the copyright for artwork that was generated directly by AI should belong collectively to the owners of the copyrights of the art used to generate the artwork, and that consent must be obtained before an artwork can be legally used in a training set under threat of violation of copyright laws. However, these ownership rights may be revoked once an extensive amount of modification (such as, for instance, consistent manual editing of large sections of the intermediate product as in cleaning up hands or jewelry that is physically impossible or biologically inconceivable (e.g, removing extra hands, paws, or fingers by replacing them with human-made versions of the same or outright replacement of them with the background), with an example of what would not count for extensive modification being application of a color filter as in using a colored sheet of cellophane or pasting in an image atop the piece as in collage) to correct errors and improve the appearance of the image, with the individual artists who made the edits in question owning the resultant-from-the-edits artwork, video, sculpture, or the like. Direct AI generation of images, video, audio, and the like would not count for being copyright-eligible, as per the outcome of the dismissed series of events during 2011-2018 where a pair of pictures created by a piece of accidentally unattended equipment being used by a Celebes Crested Macaque (species identifier Macaca nigra) garnered a lawsuit between the organization known as &quot;People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals&quot; (henceforth in this comment abbreviated as &quot;PETA&quot;), the photographer (one british citizen by the name of David J. Slater), and the organization known as &quot;Wikimedia Commons&quot;. PETA purported that the copyright for the image belonged to the Macaque by virtue of it being the one that intentionally activated the mechanism. Slater purported that because he owned the equipment, he logically owned the copyright due to being the owner of the materials used to make the image. Wikimedia Commons purported that because the Macaque that took the image was not legally a Person, the image therefore fell under the Creative Commons. In the first case between Slater and Wikimedia Commons, the United States Copyright Office sided with Wikimedia Commons, ruling that because the Macaque was not a legally-recognized person due to being a wild animal that had not applied for personhood, the image fell under public domain, but left open the route for Slater to claim ownership of the image by an alternative route, one which Slater has not pursued. In the second case between Slater and the self-publishing company known as Blurb Inc. (collectively referred to as the defendants), and PETA, PETA purported that because the monkey was the one to activate the device, the monkey owned the copyright protections to the image, with the intent being to use that case as precedent for other cases. The defendants, on the other hand, purported that the ruling from the earlier case between Slater and Wikimedia Commons still applied, and the judge presiding agreed with them, throwing out the case between PETA and the defendants. PETA subsequently appealed, and the case was thrown out by the appellate court as well on the same grounds, establishing precedent that art must be made by an entity that is legally recognized as a person in order to qualify for copyright protection. In my eyes, this summarily excludes modern AI-generated artwork from being directly copyrightable, as the Macaque is at least a biological lifeform with a complex cortex and therefore has a plausible path to being considered sapient and thus subsequently a legally-recognized person if it so chooses to take that path, while at our current level of technological advancement, the algorithms used to generate AI artwork are not self-aware in any sense of the word, and as such, cannot qualify for personhood due to not being provably sapient.
