While pretty much any and all art is inexorably influenced and inspired by other art, AI art goes beyond that and delves into dangerous and unethical territory. The state of AI currently is a wild west; images are generated from existing works of art and photography without any regards for the copyright of the original piece, and some of these generated pictures come out as near identical to the art which the AI referenced. It&#39;s obvious when you compare them side by side - frequently the original artist&#39;s signature is even still embedded in the generated image.<br/><br/>I&#39;m both an artist and a computer scientist, so while I understand the benefits of AI, I see the dangers of it too. This is something that should be reeled in, and quickly - not given legitimacy via allowing copyrights of effectively stolen work. If restrictions are put on how AI art is generated there might be room to negotiate, but as it stands, it is nothing but stolen work mashed together. To copyright that puts the original artists livelihoods in danger.<br/><br/>Thank you.
