I am concerned about the threat AI poses to copyright holders, in particular those creators of artistic works. We already know that ChatGPT, among other LLMs, scraped information off the internet that encompasses both non-copyrighted and copyrighted material, enabling it to create facsimiles of art styles, literary voices, music, among other creative expressions. As art is a vital part of our global culture, it is important to treat this as a resource and heritage that must be protected, including the legal protections offered by copyright, which allow artists to prevent the copying and dilution of their work and thereby retain its value. Without safeguards or ways to properly compensate the creators, Generative AI puts the system at risk, while also impoverishing us culturally. I am troubled to already see this occurring in the publishing space, as scammers are utilizing Generative AI to churn out books for sale using the name(s) of established authors. These low-quality works are demeaning to the author, violate their right to having control over the voice and content they have created, and do a disservice to any reader who has the bad luck to buy them. Generative AI has other uses that do not diminish our ability to create and profit from original works, and I believe that it can be harnessed to do so, but only if legal safeguards are put into place that regulate its use and signal to the end user that AI was utilized instead of a human.
