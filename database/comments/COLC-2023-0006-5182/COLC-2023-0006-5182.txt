AI, while an amazing tool, cannot and should not ever be held above or seen as human. Especially since the AI out at this moment isn&#39;t actual Artificial Intelligence. It is an algorithm fed samplings of others work that it regurgitates and is easy to manipulate, therefore harmful. It should not even be a thought that anything made from it is copyright-able due to this as well as it is impossible for it to create original ideas/intellectual properties, technically everything produce would fall into parody at best, and Fan Fiction at worst, neither of which hold a candle to original ideas crafted by humans with time, thought, and effort.
