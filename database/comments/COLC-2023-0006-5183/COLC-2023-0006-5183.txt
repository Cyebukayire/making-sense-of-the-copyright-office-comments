There is seemingly no reason or excuse to withhold royalty payments and citation to the original artists that which are used in the creation of any AI art piece. As the program must keep track of exact percentages of what the sum result piece has sampled and where each sample comes from. Even if the program has sampled 0.005% of 20,000 original works to create a piece. Those are all traceable by design and could; if the designers of the program so desired, be used to distribute royalties. The path forward for these programs is clear, and symbiotic with the creators it samples. Artists must freely submit their works to a database separate from general public forums if they wish for their work to be sampled, and in return receive payment proportional to the percentage with which said work was sampled and the revenue generated using it.This is equally applicable for AI generated literature and audio as well.
