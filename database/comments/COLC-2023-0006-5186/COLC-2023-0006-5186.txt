The purpose of a copyright in the first place is to protect a human&rsquo;s rights, isn&rsquo;t it? Without a human there is nothing to protect. Artificial intelligence, or &ldquo;AI&rdquo; has no need for protection, because, as it is not human, it cannot have human rights that need defending. A work, written, illustrated, or otherwise produced with AI, without human influence, input, or direction cannot be considered for protection under copyright law as copyright is to protect a human.
