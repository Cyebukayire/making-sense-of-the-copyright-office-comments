Most generate AI models are trained off of billions of works without the users consent or knowledge, I don&rsquo;t think these AI models should be allowed to train on peoples work without very clear warnings that their work will be allowed to be trained. The only thing that these models should be allowed to be trained on are a companies copyrighted work or public domain works and otherwise should be ILLEGAL to train on someone&rsquo;s copyrighted work without their consent.
