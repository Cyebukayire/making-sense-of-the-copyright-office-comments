AI, while capable of helping people, at the moment is unregulated. This has caused actors, artists, writers, and content creators of all kind to struggle. AI uses other peoples work (usually without consent or buried in terms of agreement) to profit. They use voices, art, and movements of real people for profit. I think AI cannot be copyrighted because AI is just a copy.
