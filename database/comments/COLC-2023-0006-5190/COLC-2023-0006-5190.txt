The works produced by &quot;AI&quot; are plagiarism. We don&#39;t allow plagiarism in schools, and we should not condone it in adult life either.<br/><br/>The works should never be allowed to be used for profit (or grades). <br/>The bots should not be allowed to steal work.<br/>Perhaps they can be limited by only pulling data from non-copyrighted, public domain source material.<br/><br/>Until &quot;AI&quot; refers to true sentience, such that it is possible produce original, non-stolen work, then AI products should never be copyrightable.
