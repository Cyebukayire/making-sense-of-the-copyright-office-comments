Simply put, Artificial Intelligence is no more than a tool like an electron microscope or a socket set. The direction for A.I. today is to have it glean information both public and copyrighted or trademarked. Since only humans can copyright or trademark, I would have A.I. acknowledge it is using such information and note it somewhere. If the A.I information is used for profit, then somehow compensation must go to the copyrighter or trademark entity. If the A.I. information is totally new, then the entity owning the A.I. may profit without compensation.
