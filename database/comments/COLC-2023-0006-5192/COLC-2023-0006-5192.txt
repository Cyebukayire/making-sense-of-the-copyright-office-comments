I am an artist and animator. My hand and my ability is how I make my living. My art is mine because I made it with my own hands, and that is why I can put my name on it, and claim it as my work. AI generated artwork is built off of the work of thousands of artists just like me, made of an amalgamation of work that real people created, most of which are copyrighted by them. AI work cannot be copyrighted because the work it is made up of stolen, copyrighted works. Do not allow AI to be copyrighted so that I can rest easy knowing that my work cannot be stolen legally and claimed as someone else&rsquo;s.
