We need, as humans beings, sustainable and ethical measures not only regarding our environment but ALSO towards our human existence. That said, we need to protect our creative work from being STOLEN and used without compensation, generating more economic disparity. Technology, money and power will be even more concentrated and as a result we will have more people without jobs. Some things are just WRONG. And AI REGULATION with FAIR COMPENSATION is the RIGHT thing to do before it is too late.
