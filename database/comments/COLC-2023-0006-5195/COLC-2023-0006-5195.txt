I am writing to express my view that using copyrighted material for the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) should not be considered a violation of copyright law. As we stand at the threshold of a technological revolution that promises to reshape industries, enhance productivity, and improve lives, it&#39;s crucial that we establish legal and regulatory frameworks that foster innovation, rather than stifle it. Below are key arguments for why copyrighted material should be permitted in training LLMs:<br/><br/>Promoting the Progress of Science and Useful Arts<br/>The underlying goal of copyright law, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution, is to &quot;promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.&quot; Language models, which are used in everything from accessibility technologies to advanced scientific research, unquestionably contribute to this constitutional objective. Restricting the data that can be used to train these models would impede scientific progress.<br/><br/>Transformational Use and Fair Use Doctrine<br/>One of the crucial tests for fair use involves assessing whether the copyrighted material is used in a way that is &quot;transformational&quot; rather than &quot;derivative.&quot; LLMs do not simply reproduce copyrighted content but transform it by learning patterns in the data to generate novel outputs. As such, their use could be considered fair use under current legal doctrines.<br/><br/>Non-consumptive Use<br/>LLMs use copyrighted text for training, but the original text is not displayed or consumed in the process. Instead, these models analyze patterns in the data to understand language structure, grammar, and context, similar to how search engines index the internet. Such non-consumptive uses have historically been less likely to be seen as violating copyright.<br/><br/>Fostering Innovation and Competition<br/>Restricting the use of copyrighted material for training would disproportionately impact small companies and individual researchers who can&#39;t afford extensive licensing agreements. This would effectively reserve AI development to a few well-funded entities, hindering competition and slowing down the rate of innovation.<br/><br/>Public Interest and Societal Benefits<br/>LLMs have the potential to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, education, and accessibility. Restricting their training data would limit their effectiveness and, by extension, their ability to contribute to society. For instance, more effective language models can improve diagnostic accuracy in medicine, personalize education, and help differently-abled individuals communicate more efficiently.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while the protection of intellectual property is of the utmost importance, it&#39;s crucial to balance this with the societal benefits that could arise from unfettered research and development in the field of artificial intelligence. Therefore, I urge [Department/Committee] to consider these points in their evaluation of the use of copyrighted materials for the training of Large Language Models.
