I am against the proliferation of AI used in creative industries for several reasons. Firstly, the net social effect is negative, discouraging personal creativity and emphasizing profit. Unless we reach a full post-scarcity society, to automate creative work out of necessity takes away from what makes life worthwhile. Secondly, even if AI does not qualitatively destroy creative industries, it absolutely harms them and the economy as a whole. It means less jobs and less pay for some of the most skilled workers in society. Finally, and most directly important to this form, they badly violate copyright. AI are trained upon artists&#39; images without their consent or permission and then take their very jobs. Please regulate AI and prevent these outcomes.
