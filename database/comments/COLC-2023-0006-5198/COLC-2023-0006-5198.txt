Artificial intelligence is a threat to all artists intellectual property. It allows for bad faith use of our works, and to avoid proper compensation and payment for our content. If we live in a world where in the copyright of media lasts long past a person&#39;s death, we should not live in a world in which one can bipass that copyright by re-working assets of copyrighten and established media to establish it as their own. Copyright was created to protect the small artists just as much as it was to protect overarching corperations, and the abuse of power that ai allows for every artist cannot be understated.
