I am a digital content and user experience designer with over 6 years of experience and just under 6 months of experience with image and text generative AI.<br/><br/>Generative AI digital products (machine-learning software) should have agreements with or own the content that it contains. Artists/photographers/writers/filmmakers should obtain consent, a license agreement, or purchase the content in order for the AI company/software to train machine-learning software with art/photography/writing/video content they own the copyright to. <br/><br/>The software company will be required to understand the goals of the person generating the content using the software and explain it to that person explicitly:<br/><br/>(1) Is the purpose and character of the content for a commercial nature, personal use, or nonprofit educational purposes?<br/><br/>(2) What is the nature of the copyrighted work and did [company] obtain permission from the holder of the copyright to use the work for the software?<br/><br/>The person querying or prompting the software for content should have the copyright to that content. The company should not own the rights to the generated content, unless the company explicitly states that this is open-source, and no one owns it. <br/><br/>If in the case of open-sourced software, a person who queries or prompts the content should be aware that it&#39;s for personal use or ideal generation only. The person who queries or prompts the content should be responsible for the following:<br/><br/>(1) Is the generated content substantiality used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole? This should be the responsibility of the person generating the content. <br/><br/>(2) Will the individual &quot;transform&quot; the content or adds &ldquo;something new, with a further purpose or different character&quot; before it is available commercially? This is the responsibility of the person generating the content.
