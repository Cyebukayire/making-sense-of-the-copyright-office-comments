AI-generated art should not be copyrightable. Permission needs to be given by artists before their work is used to train AI, and they must also receive credit and compensation. Using AI to mimic someone&#39;s voice to make statements on their behalf should be equivalent to slander. People should not be able to profit off of works that they claim are &quot;by&quot; a certain artist, when, in truth, said artist had no intentional involvement in their creation. To clarify, when I say &quot;artist,&quot; I mean anyone in a creative field whose work can be used by AI. Any statement I have used the term &quot;artist&quot; in should include illustrators, actors, (live-action, motion-capture, and voiceover) writers, painters, comic book artists, and others.
