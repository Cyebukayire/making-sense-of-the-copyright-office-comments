It&rsquo;s a classic horror movie trope - robots are planning on taking over the world! I know we don&rsquo;t live in a society with sentient robots, or at least not yet, but every legalization of AI in our daily lives inches us further to a potential horror filled future. <br/><br/>Science and art always push the envelope of society, so that maybe one day we will be free of our capitalist chains. In the meantime however AI can positively change how we do things, but it&rsquo;s so relatively new that it can&rsquo;t possibly do all of the things we want from it. This is because we have been brought up with the idea of a silver bullet, or magic pill that will cure all our problems, but there&rsquo;s no way of actually doing that - life is just too complicated. That&rsquo;s why we fund the arts and sciences in the first place, to help make sense of our crazy, busy, drama-filled lives. Yes, AI can be helpful, but it&rsquo;s just a tool in the ever changing landscape of human life. Would you ask an inanimate object to write a brand new show, or a movie? Right now, technology is only as good as we make it. And we&rsquo;re still working on it. We&rsquo;re not perfect, and neither is our tech.
