Companies should not be able to vacuum up whatever they like, copywritten material or otherwise, to generate &quot;content&quot;. To do so is blatant theft. None of these &quot;AI&quot; software companies are creating AI. There is nothing &quot;intelligent&quot; there. It is plagiarism software. It steals from creatives to spit out remixed content and does so without payment toward or consent of the creatives it steals from. Companies should scrap whatever they&#39;ve made using stolen material and have to rebuild using their own created data sets. Otherwise - they should be paying anyone and everyone to use their creations. We have payment models set up for that already, whether through buyouts or pay-to-play models. (such as in music, or residuals for TV/Film performances)
