AI is a violation of intellectual property and can be used to defame the original creators of the property with generated content that goes against the creators&#39; beliefs. Any profits earned from AI generated content should be distributed to the creators that were unrightfully used without permission, if profit should be earned at all. I do not believe AI has any place in the working industry.
