Hello. I am an independent contractor working in primarily music and audio design. I spend most of my time working in musical theater and piano accompaniment, but spend a good portion of time as an online freelancer. I have many friends who are online freelancers as well. AI-generated art has come in and made a huge mess of the whole place, opening the door to the destruction of many artistic jobs such as voice acting, digital media, and corporate commission work. I will confess to not being an expert on copyright law.<br/><br/>My personal experience has not been affected yet, as I create music and audio, but I have no doubts I&#39;ll have to deal with AI. In the meantime, artists and voice actor friends of mine are losing work at a rapid pace due to AI. Corporations are opting to use cheap AI to replicate humans instead of hiring humans. Predatory contracts where you sign away the rights to your own work so a company can create many copies using AI or generate new work with AI are being passed around. Art websites are being taken over by AI-generated artwork because someone threw a few words into a prompt.<br/><br/>And, sure. AI is going to happen one way or another. It&#39;s the unregulated use of copyrighted material that is the problem. There is no transparency of what material is used for these AI models, and there is absolutely no repercussions of using copyrighted material. One could essentially take someone&#39;s work, tell an AI machine to make something similar to it, and now they have that someone&#39;s work with enough changes that a copyright claim could not be made. It is a copyright laundromat and has led to the loss of work for many people I know, and I&#39;m sure it will eventually lead to loss of my own work too. It needs hard regulation as to deter the thieves that will use it to replicate someone&#39;s work and the businesses that will seek to disregard an entire field of work in order to have a cheap substitute.<br/><br/>So, first, AI art should not be copyrightable. It should be marked as created by an AI and usage of AI models should be disclosed. AI models should need to be able to prove they own copyright for everything they use in generating artwork, if it is being made for a profit. Any material used without copyright should be met with fines and should serve as a precedent for legal action. <br/><br/>Ideally, AI should be relegated only to hobbyists and not used in place of actual humans. It&#39;s already been taking over the corporate commission market and causing damage to the livelihoods of friends working in the fields of voice acting and digital artwork. <br/><br/>This is a question of whether or not artistry is killed off for the sake of cheap, easily-produceable substitutes. People&#39;s artistry will be stolen, repackaged, and used to push out people working in creative fields. Because, currently, as it is now, unregulated AI is used to steal creative work and republish it. It robs people of their own copyright. To allow AI to copyright the output generated by stolen art is extremely immoral and will massively muddy the legal waters for any sort of creative work in the future. How is anyone supposed to protect their own copyright when it can so easily be washed away by someone using a program to make a forgery of their work? Without any sort of legal consent?<br/><br/>Thank you for reading this. I&#39;ll attempt to answer the questions you put below.<br/><br/>1. It is currently affecting creators by muscling them out of their own work markets, and copyright owners by taking their material without consent. It would be blasphemous to allow AI work to be copyrighted, specifically because of this. It&#39;s wonderful for anybody who doesn&#39;t want to pay a creator for their time, experience, and craftsmanship.<br/><br/>2. I&#39;m lucky enough to work in live performance, for right now, as a musician. I&#39;ve begun seeing other aspects of the productions I help with using AI as opposed to paying humans. It can be beneficial to the people that don&#39;t otherwise have the time or the money, but that number pales in comparison with the amount of people with ill intentions or that simply don&#39;t WANT to spend the time or money.<br/><br/>3. I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have anything but personal experience.<br/><br/>4. I don&#39;t know. International consistency would be great but I don&#39;t think international consistency is possible for even basic human rights, so.<br/><br/>5. Absolutely. Generative AI needs to have a stop put on it, and fast. The outputted material of it should not be copyrighted unless all materials used in the generation of the outputted material are owned by the same person or entity that generated the material. Or, more simply, if I or my own company owns all the material going into an AI training set, then and only then would I be able to put the copyright on that material, and the copyright should be shared by everybody under my umbrella. The amount of unregulated usage of copyrighted material in these models is huge right now. Blatant thievery dressed up as technological advancements.
