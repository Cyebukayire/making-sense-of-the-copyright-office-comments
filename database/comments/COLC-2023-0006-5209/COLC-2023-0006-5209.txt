I&#39;m an author, playwright, and screenwriter. There&#39;s no actual intelligence in AI, it&#39;s mis-named. It is straight-up THEFT. These are bots that scrape everything human beings create and regurgitates our work without acknowledgment of and in flagrant disregard of copyright laws. The tech is there to enrich a handful of billionaires who already contribute the most to terrible conditions for workers in every field and worsen the climate change that already threatens our existence. These unchecked tech human beings are unleashing so-called AI to take our livelihoods, our ability to support ourselves and our family, the ART that MAKES US HUMAN, and eventually, our existence. We need bans, regulations, immediate crack-downs.
