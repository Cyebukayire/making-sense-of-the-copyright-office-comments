Generative AI works are fair use. They derive from, not plagiarize, data sources. In the future, this distinction will become key for all individuals, companies, and even government offices to create useful synthetic information. Such information is not just creative works, but scientific discoveries or insights that may lead to innovation. Imagine a chatbot that eases research into genetic diseases becoming hobbled by claims from publishers which may have had nothing to do with the field. There is a lot more at stake for the future than the fate of dubious copyright cases.<br/><br/>Congress should seek caution to hamper innovation at a crucial recovery point for the economy. AI with limited datasets have lower quality outputs and our geopolitical adversaries do not care where they derive their data sources. The fate of data ownership may wind up with governments overseas.
