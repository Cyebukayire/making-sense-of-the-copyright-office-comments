The rise of AI, especially unregulated AI, is a danger to us all. When more work is automated fewer jobs are available to sustain our rapidly growing population. AI, though, also threatens creative fields once thought safe from all this. By creating collages of unlicensed work AI threatens to take over the livelihoods of artists who have granted us some of our finest memories. As an author, I find this especially troubling; so much of writing is speaking to the human core of a thing and seeing if someone else feels the things that you&#39;ve felt. To prevent the degradation of our culture, to keep people employed, and to see to it that art remains the domain of human emotion, we need to be certain to regulate these matters. Else companies will done as they have always done and seek to maximize profit over art.
