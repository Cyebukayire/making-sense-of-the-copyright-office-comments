I believe AI tools should not be able to use material under copyright without express written permission. I don&#39;t believe AI-generated material should be able to be copyrighted. I don&#39;t know how that would work with works that are partially and not fully AI-generated but I don&#39;t believe AI-generated work is worthy of being protected by copyright.
