AI generated art, images, videos, songs and voice is a threat to artists everywhere, not to mention the technology is entirely based on the theft of art as a whole. Many people make their living off their art, whether they&#39;re a big time artist or something smaller. Having AI be able to take their hard work and use it without permission is theft and directly effects their business. Also in addition to that AI generators use stolen images/sounds to generate results, AI art is generated by a program and not a person, thus the people who use those programs are not the creators. They should not be able to copyright those results as their own, as not only was the work used by the program not belong to them, the generated result was not made by them in any way. In addition, AI works can be a threat to people in general. AI can be used to create audio and/or video of people saying or doing things they didn&#39;t do or even creating inappropriate sexual content of people without their consent. Overall, I believe AI will be a major problem going forward if left to its own devices, so something needs to be done soon.
