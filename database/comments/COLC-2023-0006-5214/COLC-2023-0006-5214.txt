AI has no business being used the way it has been used recently. So many artists have had their work stolen, and it&#39;s only been getting worse. Even as a voice actor, I am terrified about AI being used to clone and steal my voice (which has already happened to many of my colleagues) and not being protected. Writers, actors, voice actors and artists need to be protected. The fact that huge companies like Disney have even been using AI is atrocious. These algorithms take things that have been created by others and do absolutely nothing to warrant being considered original works. There needs to be laws agaist this theft, and I genuinely hope it happens. People who steal ideas, art and even the voices of others should not be free to do so, and should recieve consequences.
