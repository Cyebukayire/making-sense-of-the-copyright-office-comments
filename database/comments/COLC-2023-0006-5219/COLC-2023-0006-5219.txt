When creative works are used without permission in any other circumstance, it is considered copyright infringement. The same should logically be true for AI generated content, which uses creative works to to algorithmically reproduce the work with some changes. It&#39;s like if Person A traced Person B&#39;s art and claimed it as their own. The only difference is that Person A is an AI, and is tracing Person B-Z&#39;s art all at the same time.
