I believe AI training should NOT be able to pull from existing artworks without consent, and should be set to opt-OUT by default, UNLESS said art is at least old enough that a copyright expires (whether the original artist obtains a copyright or not is irrelevant, as the general public often does not have the time/money to apply for copyright to every art piece they create).<br/><br/>Using publicly created art to train these a.i. machines is stealing creative content for automated purposesto benefit those that already have instead of the creators putting their time/money into creating art. This includes photos, fanart, voices, bodies etc. All of this creative content belongs to a human being and by no means does another person/corporation have the right to use that art, voice, and/orbody to make a profit without the owner opting to do so.<br/><br/>AI work should NEVER be allowed to be copyrighted simply because it is not art to begin with. It is technology that uses a base that belongs to an actual human and taking that content to output a product that may or may not be the owner of that works intent. <br/>It can be used for malicious misinformation (it already is), to spread falsities in others voices, spread lies in photographic &quot;evidence&quot;,  and put literal words in the voices of someone who never said them to manipulate the truth. It is an EXTREMELY dangerous tool thats already being used improperly which is why it needs heavy regulation to begin with.<br/><br/>If you go to youtube right now youll be able to find a plethora of videos of the president (both current and former), saying things theyve NEVER said and some of them are extremely difficult to tell that theyre not actually human. Yes a lot of it is parody, but just think hard about the implication that people right now have the right to use the most powerful leader of the country and making them say whatever they want and having it be indistinguishable from the real person.<br/><br/>Just because I speak to the public, it is not consent to use my voice/recordings to train AI in my voice/likeness.<br/><br/>All that to say I believe AI CAN be a gelpful tool if used the correct way with consent, but at the moment it is NOT being used that way. It is maliciously stealing content from the general public to train machines to replace them and/or as a tool to promote misinformation at an alarming rate because these machines are being trained indiscriminately of any person(s) consent and THAT needs to be stopped.
