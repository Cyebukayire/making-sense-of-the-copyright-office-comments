I am completely opposed to AI being trained on copyrighted works or being used to produce works that are copywritten. This would be a legal nightmare on multiple fronts - how would you define an original work by AI trained on copywritten works when you can easily see the material it has created from? AI is not yet advanced enough for this and would be used purely for profit. The only way AI produced works could be copywritten would be if the AI itself was sentient and able to produce original work without being trained. Furthermore, I do not think our current legislative body has enough understanding of AI or even technology to create rules that govern its use, and people in the space currently all have vested profit motives that would not ultimately benefit anyone. It could lead to people being exploited. Please stand firm on opposing AI in creative spaces.
