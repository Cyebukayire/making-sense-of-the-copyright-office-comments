Because of my disability, art is one of the few fields where I can even work part time. AI will destroy that. Corporations that have infinitely more money than I do have used my work and thousands like me to push me out of the few places I can use my limited body to help support myself. Giving them the power to copyright the works they built on my back will only harm me even more. The fact that any work they produce with their insidiously sourced datasets remain in the public domain and make it harder to be monetized is the last protection I have. It&#39;s the only thing that stops people from taking my body of work away entirely. Otherwise, I&#39;ll be completely devoid of income and will rely entirely on the government for help.
