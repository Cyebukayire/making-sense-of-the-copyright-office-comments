As a striking Hollywood writer, I am against allowing tech companies to copyright any work derived from human effort. Nor do I support them using my words and work to train their mislead and then copyright any products derived from that. If they want that kind of help they need to pay for it as they always have. Without protecting original work that is being used to train models, the original creators will have no compensation and we enter into yet another David and Goliath situation between writers/creators and corporations who previously at least would be forced to pay for our efforts. Please keep this future from arising.
