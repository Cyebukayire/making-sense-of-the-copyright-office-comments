Like many, I am an artist and a writer. I also love acting, singing, and listening to music. All things that have been fundamentally a part of the human experience since time memoriam. A.I, or machine learning as it should be called, does not contribute to that experience. It in fact robs those whose energy, blood, sweat, and tears did contribute for monetary gain while not a single one of the contributors receive a penny. The goals of those in charge of these Machine Learning (ML) programs have always been to disrupt processes and livelihoods they at best, no nothing and at worse, don&#39;t care about. It has always been about the bottom dollar regardless of the millions of lives it will destroy and the removal of accurate and reliable data on the Internet. The fact that those in charge of these MLs call it A.I is an anthropomorphized marketing tool, conjuring images of sci-fi movies and books, in which none of is true. Instead, MLs don&#39;t have true intelligence, intentions, or aspirations. They are like advanced copy machines that need input from humans to work, many humans who without their knowledge and against their will had their works fed into the machine. Pro-&quot;A.I&quot; proponents often say that it is a tool or it learns the same way humans do. As stated above, neither can be the case. Tools require skill sets, and skill sets are transferable. MLs don&#39;t require such skills outside of their making them. And as MLs can&#39;t experience life or think on its own, anthropomorphizing them by comparing them to the human brain is both laughable and insulting.<br/><br/>As of right now, the lack of compensation, and the ability to be an opt-in program over their opt-out approach (which ignores the fact that a. Not all people know their work is being used, b. The original creators could be dead, and c. The human element allows copycats or those with malicious intent to perform the maximum amount of damage), and their clear disruption of industries they no nothing of their inner workings for, for the sake of &#39;good enough&#39;, low quality theft-amalgamates is a massive problem. With no regulations to stop them or guide them into ethical use that can harmonize with all affected, it could not only lead to the loss of billions upon billions of dollars for these industries, but also the loss of millions of creative minds and wills that not only use it as livelihoods, but use it to live as human beings.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
