AI programs should not be able to generate content that is produced from writing or art that the original creators did not consent to being used in that way, especially if the AI is for commercial use. In addition, I strongly feel that anything created using AI generation (ex: news articles, art submitted for contest or career opportunities) should be clearly marked as the product of AI and not original work. I also feel that it would raise serious concerns about jobs in advertising, entertainment, and potentially any creative field if work produced by AI was allowed to be copyrighted itself.
