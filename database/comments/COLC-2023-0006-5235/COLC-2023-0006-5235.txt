Online scrapping of personal information, stories, submissions, photos, art or other works is unethical and should be illegal. Never have I consented to have any of the work I&rsquo;ve posted online be used to fuel an AI engine, and I certainly don&rsquo;t consent to allowing the people behind said AI and scrapping to profit off of my work or other things I&rsquo;ve posted. I do not feel comfortable having personal work used to power an engine made to generate profit, of which I will never see a penny of. These practices should be heavily monitored and regulated, because what they are doing isn&rsquo;t right nor is it ethical. It&rsquo;s shameful, and it&rsquo;s taking advantage of the internet, the vast tool that it is. It&rsquo;s violating our trust and privacy, not to mention the amount of copyrighted works it&rsquo;s scrapped from online pdfs and others sources to build this AI. This isn&rsquo;t legal, as it&rsquo;s directly stealing and profiting off of stolen content, not adding anything new to it.
