AI is training on other people&rsquo;s content without those people&rsquo;s consent, and then producing things that look like those people made it, which in turn results in overal misinformation and loss of potential income for the people who made the content the AI trained on. Furthermore, when people then use the content the AI has produced to make money, the people who&rsquo;s content the AI trained on often don&rsquo;t get any money for it, despite making up most of the reason the content the AI produced can even exist. The modern AI shouldn&rsquo;t even be called an AI because it is in no way intelligent, it is just a slightly more complex than usual algorithm. Content produced by AI shouldn&rsquo;t be copyrighted under any circumstances, as it is a copy of other people&rsquo;s work. Under no circumstances should the content produced by AI be considered the same as content produced by humans, considering the difference in time and effort between the two, and the fact that AI is using human content to even make the AI content in the first place.
