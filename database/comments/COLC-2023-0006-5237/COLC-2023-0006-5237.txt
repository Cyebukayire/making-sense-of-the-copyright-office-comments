A world where AI makes art while we are stuck in dangerous low paying jobs is not the world I want. There is nothing intelligent about AI. It&#39;s a regurgitating program that barely follows coherence. AI is a parlor trick that should not be allowed in any professional capacity. People should not be allowed to profit off of anything AI produced. It&#39;s plagiarism with a flashy name.
