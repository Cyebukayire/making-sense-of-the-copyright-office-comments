Submission to the U.S. Copyright Office: Copyright Issues Raised by Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)<br/><br/>Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am writing to provide comments on the copyright issues raised by generative artificial intelligence (AI), as part of your ongoing study. As a concerned citizen, I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this critical discourse that impacts technological innovation, intellectual property rights, and broader societal interests.<br/><br/>The central point of this submission is that while copyrighted material does indeed form part of the training data for AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), its use is both transformative and non-consumptive. As such, I propose that regulation should focus more on the output of these models rather than the input, aligning with key principles of the fair use doctrine.<br/><br/>Transformative Nature<br/>AI and LLMs utilize copyrighted material in a way that is fundamentally transformative. The end products&mdash;whether they be text, images, or other forms of media&mdash;are often novel and do not serve as substitutes for the original copyrighted works. This usage can be viewed as &#39;non-consumptive&#39;, a term that signifies the data is used to create something new and is not a direct substitute for the original work.<br/><br/>Limited Inclusion and Fair Use<br/>In the context of training data for AI, the proportion of any single copyrighted source is likely to be minuscule due to the vast amount of data involved. Given this fractional inclusion, the use of copyrighted material does not dilute the value of individual works. Instead, it fulfills the fair use criteria by being both transformative and non-consumptive, thereby serving broader public interests. I believe training or fine-tuning on larger percentages of copyrighted material for  commercial use should be prohibited.<br/><br/>Regulation Should Focus on Output<br/>Instead of constraining the data that goes into training an AI model, the emphasis should be on regulating what the model generates or how it is applied commercially. By doing so, it aligns well with existing copyright law that focuses on the use of derivative works and allows for more balanced and pragmatic regulatory oversight.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>The use of copyrighted material in AI training should be considered transformative and non-consumptive, fulfilling key criteria for fair use. Regulations should, therefore, be output-focused, acknowledging both the rights of copyright holders and the societal benefits and innovative potential of AI technologies.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to the outcomes of this critical study.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Mark Barbarich
