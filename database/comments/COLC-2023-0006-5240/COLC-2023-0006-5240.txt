AI-produced content definitely should not be able to be copyrighted. Copyright laws were put in place in order to protect the creativity and ingenuity of Americans and their right to safely share their ideas. AI can use technology to generate thousands of ideas and works stolen from elements of other, real artists. In this way AI generated content, including digital art and written content, is not only not original, but copyrighting that content would stand in opposition to the spirit of the laws.
