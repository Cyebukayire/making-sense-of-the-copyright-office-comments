I use ChatGPT and Midjourney daily. I think training on copyright data should be allowed as fair use. I also think AI generated content should be copyrightable only if significant human involvement is used to create it. For example, I often use 10+ prompts and the in-painting feature (which lets you change just a small portion of the image) to generate images. Since there is significant human work involved, I think those should be copyrightable. <br/>
