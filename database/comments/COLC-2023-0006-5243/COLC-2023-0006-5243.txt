The means by which AI gets its ability to generate content (images, text, and other) is from inference based on mining data from other, copyrightable, sources. As such it should only be considered derivative at best, and not copyrightable.<br/><br/>It is difficult if not impossible to determine when the AI engine uses copyrighted material to generate the new work. This means that if AI works take copyrighted material and generate content based on that, the original creators are left unprotected. This is the case today, but allowing AI works to be copyrighted will only make this worse.<br/><br/>Further, you can&#39;t identify an author for it, so it cannot sign over publication rights - is the author the owner of the software? Perhaps the person who wrote the prompt? Perhaps the authors of the software? Allowing AI generated works to be copyrighted seems a slap in the face to those who actually create copyrightable works.
