I don&#39;t believe that wholly AI-generated works should be eligible for copyright. I think that allowing that would encourage people to use and abuse the system, as we&#39;ve already seen people publishing entirely AI-generated books online for profit. I that AI should be trained on non-copywritten data or data that authors and artists have opted in to share. We are already seeing businesses looking to do away with positions where real people need to talk to other real people to potentially disastrous ends as the NPR article about an eating disorder helpline needing to take down its bot (https://www.npr.org/2023/06/08/1181131532/eating-disorder-helpline-takes-down-chatbot-after-it-gave-weight-loss-advice). I know it gets tricky with &quot;how much AI is allowed to be used for a work to be able to be copywritten and protected,&quot; but I think that anything that upwards of 75% generated by AI really shouldn&#39;t be considered to be an original work, and allowing copyright on such works will only incentivize abuse.
