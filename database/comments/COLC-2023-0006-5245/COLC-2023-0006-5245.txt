Artificial Intelligence programs are being trained on copyrighted works, often without the consent of the copyright holder or compensation paid to them. I support legislation that would prohibit tech companies or AI creators from training AI on copywrighted work without obtaining consent from the copyright holder and paying for the use of t heir work. Additionally, I support legislation that would prevent any work that is generated or partly generated by AI from receiving a copyright.
