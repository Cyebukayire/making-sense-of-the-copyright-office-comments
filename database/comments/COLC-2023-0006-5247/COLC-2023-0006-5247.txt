AI produced content is theft, even by taking parts from different artist or writers to create a &quot;new&quot; work, the result would not exist if not for the initial theft. Stealing individual elements from different creators makes the final AI &quot;sourced&quot; item simply a collection of stolen scraps, which can be analogous to the doctrine of the &quot;fruit from the poisonous tree.&quot; This should not be in debate.
