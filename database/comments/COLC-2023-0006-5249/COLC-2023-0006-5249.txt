I am against the copyrighting of any and all products created from Artificial Intelligence. I believe, A.I. as it currently stands is highly unreliable and often times trained on data sets composed of stolen data (artwork, writing, etc.). For this reason, I believe it should not be allowed to be copyrighted.
