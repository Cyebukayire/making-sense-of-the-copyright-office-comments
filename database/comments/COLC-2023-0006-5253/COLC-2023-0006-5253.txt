Artificial intelligence actively infringes on copyright the way it is set up right now. The AI takes images it does not have the right to, and morphs it into it&#39;s own with no clear credit from the creator (who would usually actively disapprove of such a process). Even if one could argue fair use, the bots do not always change the work enough to realize that it was not stolen, like the watermarks that sometimes appear when AI scrapes the internet for images to use. A lot of the images you also have to pay to use, which I doubt most AI generators do. AI images are violating copyright laws (and stealing jobs, but I digress), unless the programs simply use open source or public domain images.
