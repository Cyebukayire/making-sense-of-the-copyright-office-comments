KI has several problems, copyright being only one of them. In my opinion until recently no could be aware of potential issues, so<br/><br/>a) all copyright holders should have exclusive rights on everything they created with regards to KI training material EVEN if they sold commercial rights already. Reason: at the time of making their contracts KI was not even remotely an issue, so no contract could be created that was fair to the creator.<br/>b) everyone providing KI generated material in any form or service (including systems like image recognition used in cars for for automated driving, texts or images generated on all those new webservices, ....) has to publish the training material, and in case of legal issues (car accidents) also the AI model. Reason: that&#39;s the only way to ensure people are conforming with the laws.
