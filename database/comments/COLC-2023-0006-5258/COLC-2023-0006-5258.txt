Copyright is there to motivate artists to create art that can benefit society. Some artists complain now because AI can generate art on par with their own work. This takes away their livelihoods and I understand that they aren&#39;t happy about it. For me personally however, I see AI a possible tool to create works of art unmatched by humans. If you for example want to make a film, you would need a big crew and financial resources. With AI everyone will be able to create films, books, music and other forms of art that can positively impact society. The government has no right to restrict capabilities of such generative AI that could benefit us all just to secure the livelihoods of those lucky enough to make a living as an artist. <br/>Consider that AI could now make 100 new films in the style of a famous director and the AI would hold the copyright on the works. Instead of asking who should hold the copyright we should reevaluate the meaning of copyright. In our current day of age we must accept that creativity is in surplus. The freedom of expression is what matters and being able to let other people consume creations that might hold similarity to other artists&#39; work.
