Generative AI has been born from theft. It reads billions of images without permission or previous notification and &quot;adds&quot; the knowledge from all that for its own use, which was supposed to be non-commercial. Now these companies are starting to use this technology with a straightforward commercial use and we, graphic artists are being abused, and our jobs killed. Anybody can get many free &quot;illustrations&quot;, while we need a long time to complete any illustration thanks to our long-time learned skills, effort, and decades of practice. What society will learn from that is that ART doesn&#39;t mean anything. It can be done by a machine, for free (the most important thing) and it doesn&#39;t require dealing with an artist, who may complain or ask for payment or rights. <br/>We need special protection because unlike the MUSIC industry, which makes millions, is mass-followed, has hundreds of celebrities to give voice to this cause, and, is absolutely legally protected, freelance artists of any kind are alone, irrelevant, and ignored, and we&#39;re not a respected industry so everybody thinks we can be easily abused. We can&#39;t sue huge companies individually or even in groups because we&#39;re not rich. We don&#39;t have any power. We need special protection and compensation or maybe a ban on the commercial use of AI materials. I&#39;m a +20 years career illustrator, caricature artist, and cartoonist. Thanks for reading.
