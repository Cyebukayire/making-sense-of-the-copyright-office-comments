AI art should not be copyrightable. When a human makes a derivative work, they are putting their own creativity and experiences into it. When an algorithm takes an average of thousands of pieces of art used without permission and tries to recreate it with none of the new meaning or creativity, that is just theft. Do not allow theft to be copyrightable.
