Hello, I do art as a hobby, and have been drawing for all my life. Unregulated AI is a threat to artists all over, due to the AI stealing their work without permission and using it in its database. There is no way to know if someone had uploaded your art to an AI to be used. It is a threat to artists and their copyright as it is, and needs more regulations so AI can be used responsibly.
