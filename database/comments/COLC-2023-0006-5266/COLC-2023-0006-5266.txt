As the use of AI software tools becomes more prevalent in the hands of consumers and technology users, it has become increasingly obvious that the datasets used to train the AI engines have chiefly been developed and based upon copyrighted works of every description, nearly always used without seeking the permission of the copyright holders.  For this reason, I believe the Copyright Office should take an extremely negative view of issuing copyrights to anyone submitting AI created content for copyright.<br/><br/>In addition to the damage sustained by legitimate content creators whose works are used without permission or compensation, hypothetical AI content copyright holders could go further and seek undeserved damages and compensation against rightful copyright holders.<br/><br/>The whole concept just muddies the waters for legitimate content creators who are trying to earn a living and maintain ownership of copyrighted properties they own.<br/><br/>I would feel completely differently if large corporations such as Disney would relent on their insistence that copyrights be extended effectively forever for ancient IP.  If we could return to the original intent of the Constitution to allow a copyright holder a maximum of 25 years or so before any copyrighted material automatically entered into the public domain, then I would be less concerned about the damage that could be done by AI content &#39;creators&#39; receiving copyrights.  <br/><br/>I would also want special exceptions for AI content that they could never make a legal claim against any IP owner who received a copyright for IP not created by AI.
