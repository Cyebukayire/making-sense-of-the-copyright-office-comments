In the short time that AI has been presented to the public, it has already demonstrated it will dramatically affect the livelihood of almost every industry using unethically acquired data sets to further bolster those who already hold the lion&#39;s share of the world&#39;s wealth.

Jobs have already been lost to this workflow using work by creators who did not consent nor profit from this change. It is an attempt to legalize theft by those who can&#39;t produce work themselves and who do not wish to compensate those they have stolen from.
