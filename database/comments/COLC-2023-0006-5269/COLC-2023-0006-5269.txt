First of all, thank you for allowing public comment on this very pressing matter.<br/>I am a freelance digital artist, and every day I worry more and more that my livelihood will be put into peril because of the emergence of public-use AI art generators. It feels completely unfair that these generators use the artwork created by artists without permission, without compensation - and ontop of it, it is putting our careers on the line.<br/><br/>&bull; Should AI output be copyrightable? And if so how much effort needs to go in to designing a piece.<br/>No, AI output should not be copyrightable. I feel this is a very small, thin line that is keeping the damage tolerable to artists as it is. For example, if a business wanted a logo design done, they would not use AI art generators to make it, for it would be rendered uncopyrightable and worthless. Instead, they would have to go the traditional route and hire a graphic artist, thus keeping that career pathway available for certain. (This, among countless other examples.)<br/><br/>&bull; Who is liable for AI violations of copyright in the case of it producing something substantially similar to another work. EG is it the model provider itself, the end user, or both.<br/>Both.<br/>The model provider itself should have some form of caution from scraping artists&#39; work, for fear that they may be held liable. In this way, they would be more likely to either a. Only scrap artwork that they have explicit permission to do so, b. Create the artwork themselves, likely along with a team, to train their model with, or a combination of a and b. <br/>At the same time, the end user should be held liable if they purposely recreate an artists&#39; work. Seeing as reproductions in the fine art world already exist, this would have the potential to be devastating if allowed. It may make reproductions overtake the art world, with no compensation paid to the original artists.<br/><br/>&bull; Should AI likeness and voices be allowed? If so in what context.<br/>No, AI likeness and voices should not be allowed.<br/>I&#39;ve seen Voice Actors who are already requesting the removal of voice likeness, as it is hampering their careers. If it were to be made allowed, it would hurt their livelihoods. Furthermore, it is a potential security threat. Say someone tried to break into a person&#39;s apartment - and they had the likeness of said person&#39;s father on their phone (who in this hypothetical scenario, was a frequent visitor of hers). If the perpetrator were to simply knock on the door and play the AI generative likeness, then the tenant would believe it&#39;s safe to let the predator inside their home.<br/><br/>I&#39;m one of the citizens of the United States that is very concerned about the adoption of AI. While it has potential to be wonderful and exciting, I think it needs strict governing to keep us safe, rather than a loose hand.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
