Generative AI uses the hard work of thousands of creatives in order to generate one output, without any compensation to the original artists. It does not function as a human does, and it threatens the livelihoods of so many people who are already struggling. It has flooded marketplaces, displacing human creators left, right, and center. Currently, the one saving grace keeping billion dollar corporations from taking full advantage is the lack of ability to copyright the generated content.<br/><br/>Allowing AI to be copyrightable will do unnecessary and irreparable to people not just in the United States but around the world, as we will set the precedence to other countries that it&rsquo;s fine to steal others&rsquo; years of hard work and dedication as long as the profit is there. It will convey to future generations that the arts mean nothing and destroy the already slim potential to make a living off it.<br/><br/>Do not send that message. Do not allow that future.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;re begging you.
