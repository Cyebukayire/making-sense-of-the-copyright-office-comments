I don&#39;t believe that any of the modern generative AI works are copyrightable, simply put, the way modern generative AI works to my understanding is basically that it reads a bunch of data and outputs what it believes is a proper response. It is less an intellect and more an aggregator. Beyond that, It has been possible for some time to create a &quot;Library of Babel&quot; which contains all possible written works of a certain length or below, allowing AI, especially autonomous AI to produce copyrighted work could lead to the sort of situation where most of what is possible in a field is already copyrighted at least in part because a generative AI created something sufficiently close first. <br/>The last argument I have is economic. Our artistic world is currently dominated by entities that seek profit above all other purposes, if they can retain their expansion of intellectual property rights while employing far fewer creatives it will hurt human creativity due to human artistry competing for resources with AI artistry which will become the cheapest option. I understand it is not necessarily the purpose of copyright to safeguard human artistry, but in this case, generative AI provides an existential threat to workers within any mass media creative field.
