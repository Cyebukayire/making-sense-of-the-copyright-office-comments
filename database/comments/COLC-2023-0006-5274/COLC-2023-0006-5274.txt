AI/Machine Learning generative technologies scrape copyrighted data from the internet without consent in order to train their databases. This threatens millions of jobs, and discourages creatives responsible for countless products that America and the world enjoys from pursing their craft in favor of derivative material that cannot grow on its own without the help of creatives that it threatens to put out of business. The technology is abusive and exploitative, its foundations built on works they do not have the rights to use, and sets an extremely poor example of copyright protection in America. AI/Machine Learning technologies must be regulated, and the standard for data use be Opt-In Only to ensure that copyrighted works everyone are properly protected.
