These language learning models/AIs scrape the web, including pirated and copyrighted materials. They steal from artists, authors, and other creatives. As an award-winning fiction author, it&#39;s already hard enough to protect my books from theft. Now tech companies and individuals are just scooping up work with no license, permission, or payment to the hard-working people like myself who pour not only our time, money, and expertise into our work, but our very souls and the essence of what it means to be human. All work using a LLM/AI must be able to not only cite all sources but also compensate those original creators whose work was used to train the model, and only if said creator has opted in. Stop the race to the bottom in creative works and protect artists, authors, and creatives!
