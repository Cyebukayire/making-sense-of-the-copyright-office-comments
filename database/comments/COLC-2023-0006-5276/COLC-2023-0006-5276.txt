I believe that for AI-generated work to be copyrighted, the person or group attempting to obtain copyright must be able to prove the AI was trained ONLY using:<br/><br/>1. Public-domain material.<br/>2. Material the copywriting entity holds the rights to.<br/>3. Material the copywriting entity has explicit permission from the creators/owners to use for the purposes of training this AI.<br/><br/>The third condition would, of course, require being able to produce contracts proving such permission.  It should not be legal for websites to make this an &quot;opt-out&quot; feature: every individual who uploads content to a website must manually, knowingly, and willingly opt themselves in; be notified if any of their content is actually used to train an AI; be notified of what the AI is being trained to produce; and be notified of anything it has produced (for example, a short story).  A process should be in place for creators to file a claim for royalties from content generated, in part, from their material, if they feel their work has a disproportionate or otherwise substantial representation in the generated work (for example, if an image made using thousands of artists&#39; work looks like something made by one particular artist).<br/><br/>Additionally, if the AI was trained using any material under a Wikimedia Commons license, anything it produces should also be subject to the Wikimedia Commons license.
