To Whom It May Concern,<br/><br/>I am writing to express my strong concerns regarding the impact of AI systems on the rights of content creators. While AI undoubtedly offers many benefits, it also poses significant challenges to the copyright ecosystem.<br/><br/>First and foremost, it is crucial to uphold and protect the rights of content creators. The use of copyrighted works to train AI models without appropriate safeguards threatens the very essence of intellectual property rights. Content creators invest time, effort, and creativity in producing their works, and they deserve to have their rights respected and preserved.<br/><br/>The issue of transparency and disclosure in the use of copyrighted works is of paramount importance. AI systems that employ copyrighted content must be held accountable for their actions. Transparency ensures that content creators are informed about how their works are used, and it allows them to make informed decisions about licensing and distribution.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the legal status of AI-generated outputs demands careful consideration. AI-generated content can blur the line between human creativity and automated generation. It is imperative that we establish a legal framework that clearly distinguishes between original human creations and AI-generated works to protect the rights of content creators.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while AI holds immense potential, it must not come at the expense of content creators&#39; rights. I strongly urge the United States Copyright Office to prioritize the protection of intellectual property and consider legislative or regulatory steps that safeguard these rights in the age of AI. We must strike a balance that fosters innovation while respecting the hard work and creativity of content creators.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Kalan L
