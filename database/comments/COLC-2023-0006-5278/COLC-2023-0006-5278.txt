Thank you so much for taking comment on this important developing topic. Artists and writers MUST be contacted for explicit consent and receive compensation before being included in a training set, and images and writing resulting from AI should not be eligible for copyright without significant further human manipulation/improvement of the generated image. The current datasets comprised of unlicensed, illegally scraped copyrighted work should be purged and recreated using these new regulations. Thank you.
