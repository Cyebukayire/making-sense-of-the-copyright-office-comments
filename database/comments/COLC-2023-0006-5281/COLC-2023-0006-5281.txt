As a technologist (computer programmer) I am very concerned that the public discourse on this issue assumes that AIs are corporate products. They should be though of as technical tools.<br/><br/>Please do not imagine that &quot;AI&quot; must be controlled by large companies with their own economic and strategic business interests. Regulations should encourage PERSONALLY controlled AI (openly developed by academia, hobbyists, public interest groups, and government), When looked at from this point of view, when AI reads (or is trained with) any data, it should be considered the same as when an individual reads that data. When I read a book, there is no question of if I read the book &quot;legitimately&quot; -- even if I shoplifted the book or got it by other illegal means, my _reading_ is always legitimate.<br/><br/>If an individual or corporation (etc.) distributes AI-generated content then _that entity_ should be liable for their distributions -- if my AI outputs infringing content (or libel, false advertising, etc.), then my distribution of that should be prohibited in the same way any of my public speech is. If my AI generates &quot;infringing&quot; content for my personal use, then that should not be considered infringing, any more than if I copy long passages into my notebook.<br/>
