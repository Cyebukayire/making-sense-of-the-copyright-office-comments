Allowing AI to create copyrighted material would result in a tremendous loss of work for blue-collar workers who create original, unique material. Further, AI is trained off of material that does not have the permission of the initial creator, which would create a cycle of stolen material being copyrighted and then being furthered to create additional material and so on and so forth. This would be a direct violation of copyright law with explicits protects against plagiarism. Plagiarism is not just direct copying of material word for word, it&rsquo;s also the stealing of ideas for the use of passing of as one&rsquo;s own. Allowing AI to copyright material / co-author material is dangerous in that it dilutes responsibility so that it is not prosecutable or able to be held to the same standards that human creators are. There is no way to standardize or create a system where equality exists between human and machine in terms of content creation, ownership, and responsibility, and therefore should not be allowed or legalized.
