AI copyright opens the door to completely replacing blue collar workers with AI. The technology is not capable of that yet, but if allowed to create copyright material it would kill any incentive to hire humans when it does become good enough. In addition the AI models are trained using materials from creators who did not consent to this use, and if the use becomes commercial that should be a direct violation of copyright law since the copyright material would have used someone else&#39;s work to create a profit. Just because the work comes from a huge array of different sources doesn&#39;t mean that it isn&#39;t theft of intellectual property, in many ways the range of data used should be more reason to deny copyright since the scale of intellectual property theft is much larger than it would be if a single piece of work is imitated. Also allowing generative AI to be credited as author muddy legal waters if the work of the AI is found to be illegal in some way making prosecution difficult. This could be used to create legal loopholes and set up AI as scapegoats allowing people to circumvent and avoid punishment for illegal activities.
