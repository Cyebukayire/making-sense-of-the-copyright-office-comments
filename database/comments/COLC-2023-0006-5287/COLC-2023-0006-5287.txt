In my opinion AI is using the books in the same way as human do, by learning from them the concepts and facts to use later in life. Now the AI does it faster and to higher effectivity than human, but with similar purpose. For example technical book on web development will be used to teach large language model to better understand the process or particular API to help navigate user in creation of their own product. similar to reading loads of books on the topic and making notes to use the knowledge in the future. Paraphrasing the knowledge without copying the exact text is in my opinion valid reason to let large language models to learn from any document or book in public domain.
