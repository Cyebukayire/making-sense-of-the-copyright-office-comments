1. Being able to copyright generative artwork allows people to profit off of copyrighted works by using them in training their software. In addition, it also would create more potential for disinformation to spread via ai scraping from other ai generation sites. This has already been happening. For creators like myself, our work is being stolen and profited off of without permission or recognition when it is used as part of a database for training generative image software.<br/>15. Developers of AI models and creators of training datasets should absolutely be required to collect, retain, and disclose records regarding the materials they have used. In regard to image and text generation software, it is incredibly important for copyright holders to know when their images have been used, with or without their consent. In addition, many images in datasets were not supposed to be available to the public (ex. photos scraped from medical records). For a more ethical use of AI software, these databases should have to maintain records of where they obtained training images.<br/>18. A human using a generative AI software should not be considered the author of material made using the system. The use of AI models to generate art is more akin to the relationship between a commissioner and an artist. AI software used as a tool to augment something created by a human is a more complex issue, however.
