Generative AI is built on the largest copyright violation in the history of the modern world. It cannot function without the data sets that are currently supporting the various models, none of which have been properly licensed for commercial use. Copyright ensures ownership, ownership ensures protection. If this goes on unregulated, millions of people will not be protected, basic rights violated, repercussions fully unknowable at this time. Hope we can make choices that ensure safety for humanity - this is progress
