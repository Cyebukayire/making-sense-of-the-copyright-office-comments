Hello, I am a small artist who has been drawing for 7 years now. <br/>The threat of my art being stolen and put into AI databases has been on my mind heavily over this last year. I can&rsquo;t afford to fight it, I can only add watermarks and ask people not to scan my art. <br/>I shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about that. <br/>Whether you consider AI &lsquo;art&rsquo; as art or not, I should be able to dictate how my work is used.
