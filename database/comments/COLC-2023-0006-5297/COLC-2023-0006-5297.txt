AI is a massive threat to the livelihood and rights of writers, artists, and other workers in creative fields. It is being used to replace them, forcing people already in an unstable economic standing even further into economic difficulty.  Many AI programs are also trained using stories and images unintended for the purpose of corporate mass production, without creator consent. Though the data used to train these programs might not be saved directly, the results of that training are forever embedded in the AI program. That being said, some actually are made to outright mimic specific art or writing styles. The creators whose content was taken and mimicked receive no compensation or credit for the products of these programs, and as such it can be seen as a type of theft. It is entirely unconstitutional and unethical. The programs are not designed to credit the original material. Regulations must be placed on AI to prevent further theft of original work.
