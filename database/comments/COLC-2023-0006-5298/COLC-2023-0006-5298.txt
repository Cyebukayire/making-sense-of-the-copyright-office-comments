Content generated by AI has no claim to authorship. It is, by its very function as a scraping machine, built on the copyright infringement of thousands of creators who are unrecognized and unpaid for the labor that allowed the AIs &lsquo;work&rsquo; to exist in the first place. If the prompter cannot replicate their results if the program changed, or if they had to switch AI engines, a prompter is not a creator in any meaningful way either. AI is a plagiarism machine that runs on stolen labor, and regardless of the visual quality of the final result, the end point of this path could only be the complete devaluing of the very human labor that allowed AI to produce visual &lsquo;works&rsquo; in the first place. AI has no process or vision. It should not be allowed copyright protection under the law.
