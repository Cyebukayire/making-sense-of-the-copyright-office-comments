It is my opinion that the usage of AI in commercial products, such as films, television shows, drawings, voice recordings as such should be heavily regulated. The tools used to &quot;Create&quot; AI products do not create in the traditional sense, but rather steal from existing content on the internet, for instance, an AI generated image doesn&#39;t create an image, but takes existing images on the internet and merges it in an attempt to create whatever prompt is given. Non of the content used by the largest AI generators are used with permission from the creators, which becomes an issue when relating to paid content, for instance: An artist could have their drawing stolen by an Ai generator and not get credit, nor compensation for their work being used . Another concern in relation to AI is it being used for malicious purposes, what&#39;s to stop someone from inserting my voice into an AI generator to make me sound something that&#39;d cause harm, or create a compromising photo. The biggest concern of mine is AI being used in place of actual workers, particularly in media related products. No human should miss out on a gig due to a coperation wanting to use AI as a cheaper alternative. I hope you take my concerns into consideration regarding the usage of AI.
