Name: Anderson, Alice (d.b.a. Work in Progress Too)<br/><br/>I appreciate the Office&#39;s interest in this topic. Thank you for opening this important question up for public comment.<br/><br/>I am an artist, and part of my living depends on my being able to monetize my work. My work appears on my personal website as well as social media. Further, I am a support of other authors and artists, and I recognize it is an important part of our society to support the creation of art.<br/><br/>There is strong public policy in granting authors the exclusive right to their works for a limited time. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo;to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that the training of generative AI violates authors and artists&#39; rights to their works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering these comments.
