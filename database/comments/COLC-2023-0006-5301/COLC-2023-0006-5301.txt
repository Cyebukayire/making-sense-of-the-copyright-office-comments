Ai is being used irresponsibly by these companies and individuals. They are used for cheap labor when these jobs have historically been awful for writers. Being underpaid and underrepresented within the whole array of the entertainment industry. These ai are being trained by using nonprofit and profit work without credit. Scraping these websites and books to equipt the writing styles and grammar and producing nonsensical works. These stories that were produced were not made with love. They were made with written prompts and ai uses code to make the works their user wants. Copywrite was made to protect the creators works from corporations and individuals from stealing their work. And ai uses bits and pieces of people&#39;s work to create something with out the concent of the original creators.
