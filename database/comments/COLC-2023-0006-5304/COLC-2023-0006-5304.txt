Artificial Intelligence is a currently flawed term to describe what is simply pattern learning. All the AI does is glue together every work that it was feed and spits out a certain mix depending on what parameters we gave it. It works by stealing other people&#39;s designs and ideas. The original creators are not contacted and do not give consent for their works to be used by those softwares.
