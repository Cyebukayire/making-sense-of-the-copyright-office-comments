AI generated images/music/text/etc are not created by a human and thus should not be eligible for copyright protections. The purpose of copyright is to protect creators from having their creations stolen and thus losing potential profit. A computer program has no need for these protections. And the creators of these programs should not be able to claim copyright for the same reason Canon cannot claim copyright to photos taken with its cameras and Microsoft Word cannot claim copyright to books written on its word processor. <br/>
