I have made my living as a visual artist (oil painting, traditional ink and watercolor, digital) for years, living off of prints and commissions and developing a small business for myself. My works have been used to train AI image generation models countless times on many different platforms that have stated they do not use copyrighted works or artist names/styles to generate images, such as Adobe, OpenAi, and others. I have lost work and my business is doing less successfully because people are using my artwork that I make money off of to generate their own images, which I have also seen being sold as stock images and even prints. My work has been used against my consent to generate profitable work for others while I am losing business, money, and security. I do not think AI works should be copyrightable, and beyond that I do not think they should be allowed to infringe on the personal copyrights of other artists, as they are currently rampantly doing despite saying that they condone such behavior. I have seen countless other artists, musicians, and other professionals lose their jobs and work due to AI being integrated in the industry, and numerous entry level jobs are being replaced with machine learning and this new generation of workers who have just graduated with degrees in fields such as video gaming, concepting, 3D modeling, music composition, fine arts, graphic design, literature, and more, not able to find a job in this struggling market. I am not alone in these opinions and experiences.
