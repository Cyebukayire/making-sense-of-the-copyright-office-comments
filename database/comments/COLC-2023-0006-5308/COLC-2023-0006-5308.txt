AI generated art, writing, and other products are becoming more of an integrated technology with our modern world. These are useful tools to individuals and companies both, yet it&#39;s been creating a stir for some time. The lack of oversight or ethics in what or how the training data is gathered shows the gross holes that exist in the protection of individual privacy rights in the modern day. Countless people and companies both who did not consent to have their assets used in training these powerful programs have had their rights stolen from them by those who simply could purchase access to this data from data harvesting companies. In light of this, and in light of the potential these new tools bring to our society I believe that there is only one sensible way to handle this.<br/><br/>We must treat this integration of dubiously gathered data as a foregone conclusion. It has happened and until policy updates to protect individuals from the companies who profit from the erosion of personal privacy it will continue to happen. As such, it is only reasonable to treat this as a fair use case. These data points collected can be used as part of these generative AI models, but to do so they must waive all rights to copyright for these derivative works.
