As someone who has designed and used their own artificial intelligence software in the past, I can say with absolute certainty that the person running the AI software should hold no legal ownership, copyright or otherwise, over the software&#39;s output. The issue is that the software owner themself is at no point doing any actual creating. An artist, when they set out to make art, has an idea or concept in their mind, a unique idea that they are attempting to render in reality for others to see and possibly enjoy. They are directly involved in every single step of the creation process, every word typed or brush stroke made was done by them. The AI owner, on the other hand, supplies a series of inputs or prompts to the software, which are fed into a large number of complex statistical formulas, which are then evaluated and formed into an output. There is absolutely no creative process past the creation of the prompts. The software owner is only overseeing automated mathematical calculations that result in a series of data points that happen to resemble an artists work. They&#39;re not creating anything any more than someone who adds 2 and 2 &quot;creates&quot; 4. On top of that, even if the AI software was deemed to be &quot;creating&quot; in some sense, the software owner would still be akin to someone requesting a piece of art from an artist by telling them what they would like to see. The software owner has no hand in the actual creative process, and thus should have no claim to the output&#39;s copyright.
