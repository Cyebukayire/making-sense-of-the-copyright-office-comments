AI training should be opt-in ONLY, and should never be required agreements in terms of use/service. They should be a separate clause which users can opt in or out of, especially as it pertains to training. AI tools and platforms should be liable for theft of copyrighted materials or nonconsensual use of things like voice and likeness. AI works should not be able to be copyrighted, unless ALL parties who contributed to the training of the AI receive rights of ownership, and consented to their work being manipulated by AI. This directly affects my work and livelihood, and AI is actively hollowing out entry-level work in the arts, across various disciplines.
