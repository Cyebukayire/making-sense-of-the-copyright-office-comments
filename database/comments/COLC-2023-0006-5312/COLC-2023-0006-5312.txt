Works created with AI, as it is currently used and deployed in 2023, should not be given copyright protection.<br/><br/>At the same time we need to update the laws so that if sentient AI is created in the future it can obtain copyright protection. I think that&#39;s an important distinction. We shouldn&#39;t create laws that limit copyright to only biological humans, or categorically deny all artificial intelligences that ability.<br/><br/>Finally, please don&#39;t allow loopholes that would give a type of protection even if the work itself wasn&#39;t copyrightable. For example, allowing copyright to exist on the prompts that are used to create an AI work. That kind of copyright would not only prevent people from copying the work by using the original prompt, but also from iterating on a work in ways that are allowed under current copyright law.
