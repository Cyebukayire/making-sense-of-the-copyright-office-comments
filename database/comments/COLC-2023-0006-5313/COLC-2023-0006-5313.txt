Unregulated AI is a threat to copyright and my own work because AI &ldquo;writing bots&rdquo; steal from original, creative works online and pile these stolen pieces of content into articles and stories they claim to be their own. I work in digital marketing and we&rsquo;re already seeing contractors submit articles that they&rsquo;ve written with AI fail our copyright checkers. Users of unregulated AI software have also put my creative work at risk by suggesting that they feed my creative work into this software to &ldquo;finish&rdquo; my online works of fiction. AI must be regulated to protect copyright and to protect creators.
