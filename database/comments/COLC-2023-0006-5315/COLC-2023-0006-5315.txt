The fact that AI needs to be taught on other copyrighted works means that it is stolen.  In addition, we must take into consideration that an AI is not an entity nor did the creator put in any work.  Thus, it should not be a copyrightable object.  At the very least, no copyright should be given.  At best, the person using the AI to profit should have to pay every entity that the AI scraped in order to make a profit on it.  More regulations on AI should exist before a copyright can be put in place.
