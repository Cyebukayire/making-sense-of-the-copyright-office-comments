I do not agree with allowing AI to copyright. <br/><br/>I&#39;m a computer scientist friends with many, many artists. They&#39;re all terrified of what AI means for their professions.<br/><br/>I also don&#39;t agree with companies using it for any purpose until it can succeed at what it aims to do while using low power (about as much as a cellphone&#39;s daily use preferably) *and* being able to explain who to credit. I don&#39;t think these are unreasonable things, and every company should be making the tools that can create that credit report using debugging tools that they should be creating if they want to continue their business in a controlled manner. <br/><br/>Regulation should also be put in place that creates a relationship between this credit and the source&#39;s livelihood. AI cannot exist without novel data. Novel data depends on people if we don&#39;t want it to have a cascade failure. The source of this data should be protected from a business point of view and a humanitarian one.<br/><br/>Please think of the people as you make your choices.
