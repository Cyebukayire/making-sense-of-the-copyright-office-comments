I have been doing this for 25 years, and I&#39;ve been copyrighting my work since 2004, the whole point of this exercise is to prevent other people from enriching themselves over our hard work. And make no mistake, it IS hard work, it takes a toll on our health, both mental and physical, one day we won&#39;t be able to keep doing this due to old age.<br/>To prevent that hard work from being stolen and profited from illicitly is what the copyright office stands for.<br/><br/>AI is not only going to be affecting us, but will affect the entire economy in a significant manner, because we copyright holders are part of it. It&#39;s not just me, it&#39;s hundreds of thousands of talented individuals losing their livelihoods over their stolen work. It doesn&#39;t matter that it&#39;s just a small part of it per artist, collectively, it&#39;s screwing over an entire industry of hard-working people. It&#39;s dehumanizing.<br/><br/>What is the point of the copyright office then? If your work will end up as a public domain anyway? And it&#39;s not even public domain, because there&#39;s only a small group of people profiting from it. Isn&#39;t THAT what copyright theft is?<br/><br/>
