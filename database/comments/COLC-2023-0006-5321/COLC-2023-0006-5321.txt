Generative AI is nothing more than a way to launder copyrighted content to resell under a different creator&#39;s name.  If the generative AI cannot prove or provide that they have properly licensed Copyrighted content to train the AI, then any works generated by the AI should not be subject to any protection under the law.  In short, it is nothing more than artistic plagiarism with a technological wall that prohibits scrutiny of the source material used to train the system.<br/><br/>And right now, we have people trying to make money from the works of generative AI who have not offered proper attribution for their source material.  Were this done by a person, there would be legal ramifications.  However, AI seems to be exempt from both scrutiny and legal remedy.<br/><br/>Giving generative AI systems the equivalent protections of an artist or an author would eventually make copyright protection pointless, especially when there are no regulatory safeguards in place.
