Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment. I am an author &amp; artist whose living depends on my being able to monetize my work. There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time. While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI. To do so would violate the artist/author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution. The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors/artists of those works violates the Copyright Act. Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.
