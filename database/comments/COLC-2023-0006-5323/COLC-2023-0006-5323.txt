AI represents a legitimate threat to writers, artists, and intellectual property as a whole. It&rsquo;s learning models scrape the work of others, using them wholesale or piecemeal with blatant disregard for theft. AI as it exists is entirely without novelty, or human authorship, and instead consists only of what it can steal from others, editing and stitching together the talent and intellectual property of others to construct images or text output. In some cases it is so egregious as to include garbled or chewed versions of an artists signatures, or entire passages taken from the writings of Authors.
