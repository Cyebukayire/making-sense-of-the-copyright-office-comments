As it currently stands, Artificial Intelligence poses a serious risk to countless jobs in America and the world, especially those of creative individuals, without proper regulation.<br/><br/>It is important to recognize HOW these AI were programmed and taught. Most notably, image generators were trained off of countless images on the internet, many used without  consent from the original copyright holders. These image generators were then used by many people for profit, and again the original artists and/or designers of the images used to train these generators saw no form of compensation. Similar instances have happened with other similar AI, including (but not limited to) those that use writing, voice audio, or photography.<br/><br/>Voice actors in particular have voiced their concerns with &quot;AI voice-overs&quot;, considering it a violation of privacy, and a dangerous tool considering its ability to impersonate them and create deep fakes or other misleading media that could endanger their reputations and/or careers. Such instances have already begun occurring, both with AI voices and AI photos.<br/><br/>Any media created with these AI, be it in whole or in part, should not be eligible for copyright. Additionally, clear disclaimers should be displayed on any work created with AI, be it in whole or in part.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that, without regulation, AI media generation threatens the jobs of countless Americans. Not only will large companies seek to replace their employees with AI; but freelance artists, writers, and actors will have a much more difficult time finding employment.<br/><br/>As an artist, the unethical creation and use of these AI generators frightens me, and has already impacted my ability to find work.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
