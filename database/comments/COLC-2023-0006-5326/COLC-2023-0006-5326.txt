Hello, I&#39;m Karin, an amateur writer from Michigan, and I am concerned with unregulated generative AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods of my fellow writers and creatives and seen many others who aspire to become creatives face with fears of their prospects for ever even having a chance to land a career in their field, no matter how much they improve their skills.<br/><br/>This technology has already done damage by taking and using countless people&#39;s works without permission nor compensation for their work to be used into these data sets and currently there is no recourse to be compensated or force them to remove it from their data set due to the total lack of regulations.<br/><br/>Reasonable regulations should protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense. And should help this technology be used in a responsible manner that doesn&#39;t violate ethics and shrug off responsibility of a tool that can be used in so many damaging ways.<br/><br/>Please regulate these generative AI tools before it&#39;s too late for many creatives.<br/><br/> - Karin, Michigan
