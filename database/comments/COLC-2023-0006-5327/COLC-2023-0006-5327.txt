I am entirely against copyrighting anything created by AI. Nothing created by AI is original, not even coding. Everything is pulled from other people&rsquo;s work, much of it without permission and from already copyrighted work. AI &ldquo;creations&rdquo; rely entirely on the effort of people not included in the AI &ldquo;creation&rdquo; process and are both an insult to actual artists/writers and a potential legal nightmare. It is a machine designed to steal and has no human intelligence behind it, which is already a requirement for copyright in the US. Work made by artificial intelligence should not be able to be copyrighted.
