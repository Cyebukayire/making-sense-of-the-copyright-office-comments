Firstly, I wish to thank the Copyright Office for inviting public comment on AI training using copyrighted works. This issue has the potential to protect or destroy the livelihood of artists such as myself, so the opportunity to comment is, without exaggeration, of vital importance to me. <br/><br/>The very purpose of the Copyright Act is to give creators the legal protections necessary to profit from their work, so that creators will be motivated to create, in order that the arts will flourish in our country. Today, the internet and social media are essential to an artist&rsquo;s career. To obtain work, an artist must cultivate an online network and following; and this entails putting images of one&rsquo;s work online, where they can be seen. Once such images are online, only regulations of the kind under consideration by the Copyright Office can prevent their use to train generative AIs. Once trained on an artist&rsquo;s work, a generative AI will be able to produce additional work in the place of that artist, at a fraction of the price that that artist would have to charge in order to survive. The necessity of a visible internet presence forces an artist to furnish the means for his or her own replacement. In these circumstances, allowing generative AIs to be trained on artists&rsquo; copyrighted work will destroy any motivation to create expressive work. This will subvert the purpose of the Copyright Act, unemploy Americans who work in the arts, and lead to America&rsquo;s cultural impoverishment. <br/><br/>If a generative AI is to be trained on copyrighted work, the creator of that work must expressly consent, through an &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo; rather than an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; system, to such a use of his or her work. This is because an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; system cannot feasibly offer creators a way to obtain compensation for the use of their work: only in the process expressly &ldquo;opting in&rdquo; can a creator provide, for example, the information necessary to receive payment for the use of their work. <br/><br/>To allow creators to ensure that their work is not used to train generative AIs without their consent, developers of generative AI systems should be obliged to keep a record of all materials used to train the AI. This record should be accessible to the public and searchable. For example: an AI developer might, on its website, provide a means to upload an image to search for a match within the database of the AI&rsquo;s training materials. An artist would upload an image of his work, click &ldquo;search,&rdquo; and receive a reply saying either that this image was found among the AI&rsquo;s training material, or that it was not. The artist must then be able to submit a complaint if his or her work was used to train an AI without permission, and to receive redress. <br/><br/>Thank you, once again, for taking the time to consider my comment.
