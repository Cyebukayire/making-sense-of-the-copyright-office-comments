AI generated images are made by artworks and photos with out artist&rsquo;s permission. <br/>I learnt from school and society, Working is very important thing. And for the part of the society I pay the tax and work hard. Bit big tech company just made their AI models with out every Artists and normal people. And they will make enormous money with stealing informations. I don&rsquo;t know why government don&rsquo;t make some regulation of this situation. This is serious problem. Even now some people are losing their job. Such as painters and concept artists, Because big tech company making images with stolen arts. It looks good because it came from popular Artist&rsquo;s art work. At first AI gonna use nonprofit stuff, only for study. But now everybody just selling AI images on Online shop. Such as Etsy, Petrion, Artstaion. Every art communities are overflowing by AI generated images. And as a Artist, I don&rsquo;t want to upload my art on Online anymore. Because, AI guys just steal every artist&rsquo;s arts. <br/>I thought, when I work hard and draw hard, I can make money to live but now, that dream was destroyed. People who steal informations and images gonna make big money, and normal people who work hard are going to be poor.. Don&rsquo;t let them use our copyrights and informations without our consent. We need to know who used our informations and copyrights. That&rsquo;s the right of citizen in this country. <br/><br/>Thank you.
