Many AI generators source their creations from the general internet without those parties giving personal consent to use their creations for something that jeopardizes their job or way of life.  i.e. if you want a piece of art made from a certain artist, you could have an AI make you one instead of commissioning the actual artist for the piece.  This could also result in forgeries and flooding the market with art not actually made from that artist, lowering the value of the actual artists work.  Another example, if I were to make a video about a copyright object, I can not copyright that video.  The same should be true for AI.  For these reasons, I am not in favor of AI creations being able to be copyrightable.
