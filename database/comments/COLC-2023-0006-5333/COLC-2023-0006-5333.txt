Unregulated AI is a threat because not only does it take away people&#39;s livelihoods, it also steals from them in order to do it. People are having their work taken and profited from without any sort of compensation or their consent. As well, AI mimicking people&#39;s voices and appearance also are a threat because they could be used to make a person say or do things they do not agree with and have not consented to.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.<br/><br/>Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
