As a US citizen and professional author, I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to AI-generated works being granted copyright. The use of AI is NOT intended, nor will it be primarily used, as a means for actual creatives (artists, authors, etc.) to create real art but as a way for companies--especially the huge ones like Amazon, Disney, Netflix, etc.--to cut actual human creators out of the process of creating new works. AI exists for the &quot;money people&quot; to make more money but eliminating the need for actual artists and authors, which will is obviously harmful to the entire range of creative fields in this country as well as to the country&#39;s national culture. AI cannot actually create anything; it only copies and remixes, and it does so by being &quot;trained&quot; on works stolen from actual human creators without their permission. What AI pumps out is therefore by necessity derivative and lacks the core of what makes art something that humans connect with or what gives it any meaning. I strongly urge the Copyright Office to reject any notion of allowing copyright claims on works that have been entirely or primarily made using AI--or, ideally, for works that have used to any degree any machine learning more complex than a spellchecker/grammar checker. For the sake of all artists, writers, and other creatives and for the sake of the cultural soul of this country, I implore you to reject copyright for AI-generated works.
