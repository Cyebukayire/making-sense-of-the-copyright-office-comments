Thank you for being willing to hear comments from the public on an issue that is getting more and more prevalent. I may only write as a hobby, but I do know some people who rely on their creations to support themselves. And in any case, I support authors, artists, and other creators, and I feel like art is a very important aspect of a democratic society. When things are tough, art keeps us going. And copyright policies that allow artists to retain the rights to their work for a set period of time help artists both maintain control over their art and let them make their living off it. <br/><br/>So therefore, while a work is still under copyright law (especially if this is how they make their living), it should not be used to train generative AI, especially not without the author&#39;s consent. A creator has an exclusive right to control their work while under copyright, so AI using it to train violates that right. It&#39;s essentially stealing their work and then using it to turn their own profit. When it became known that one of the websites I posted my work on had been scraped to train AI, I was both furious &mdash; furious that my writing that I&#39;d spent so much time and effort to create had been stolen and used in a text generation machine that regurgitated a Frankenstein monstrosity that stitched together my work with others&#39; &mdash; and worried. I worried because all of this had happened and I had no idea. It happened without my consent &mdash; and I&#39;ve had people ask before if they could translate or quote my works before and depending on the circumstances, I&#39;ve been able to decide because it was, at the end of the day, my work and my creation. And I also worried because this was my hobby, but what about those who make their living off their art? Their bread and butter could be stolen right off their table by an uncaring algorithm and they&#39;d have no idea of it happening. Especially when with copyright in place, they&#39;re supposed to know if someone wishes to use their work and get a choice if someone else can make money off of their art. It&#39;s supposed to be protected.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions such as copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission the permission of the authors and creatives whose works are being used in the training. Artists, authors, and other creatives should be protected from such violations under the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Thank you again for allowing such commentary to be shared as well as your consideration in such matters.
