Generative AI cannot receive copyright as it is not made by any significant human involvement. The use of genuine copyrighted work is also used to train generative AI models. To give generative AI content copyright would be to sanction mass copyright infringement on a massive scale. This also includes the generation of content that infringes on the copyright of others, such as generating an image of Disney&#39;s Goofy to promote attractions at Universal Studios without permission by the Walt Disney Corporation. There is also the concern of generative AI being used to imitate the identity or style of human artists for potentially liable and destructive comments meant to hurt a person&#39;s public image and professional relationships, such as using AI of Tom Cruise to say damaging remarks about the latest Mission Impossible movie.
