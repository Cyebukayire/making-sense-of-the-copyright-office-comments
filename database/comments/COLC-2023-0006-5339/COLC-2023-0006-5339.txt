Thank you for starting inquiries about AI image generation! As a freelance artist that has had my work stolen and fed into AI image generators, I strongly urge that AI images not be copyrightable as nearly all generated images contain work without consent from the copyright holder. I would also like those engaging in theft using said generation programs and the companies creating and maintaining said programs also be open to litigation from the original copyright holders of the images that were stolen.
