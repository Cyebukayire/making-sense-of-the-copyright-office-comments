I&#39;ve have been working as a concept artist, illustrator, and designer for the last 13 years and I teach at a visual effects college in California.<br/><br/>If Ai, specifically any image generator is granted copyright in any form, even from human touch ups and transformations, it will absolutely devistate my livelyhood, those of my peers, the entire professional creative industries, it will devistate art colleges, and art professionals and all the those additional industries that rely on art and human creativity. These generators, which operate on the training of professionals, who have in good faith post their work to the internet, are now under threat of the having their livilihoods taken away from these machines. Because artist names are integral to the generation process, it operates like a plagarism machine, or more akin to identity theft, because artists spend years developing those traits, mastering those skill sets. The machine doesn&#39;t understand what it&#39;s creating, but the programmers of AI do, they know that stealing artists names and identities are essential for their programs to work, because if they delete the data sets, they lose all value. It&#39;s indisidious at best, and destructive at it&#39;s worst. It is literally impossible for artists to find every AI program to opt out, and they make it extremely difficult to find where to do that, and put up barriers and hurdles to prevent artists from opting out. The only true way to operate in good faith would be for artists to opt into their training programs. But because very little artists want to do that, again, they know that their data sets will be worthless. <br/><br/>Ai art, prompts, writing, should not be given copyright in any form, it is only built to replace and destroy copyright. This is quite different than a tool used to assist the artist in a task and all artists know the difference. Thank you for taking the time to review the comments on this extremely important issue. I believe so far the US copyright office has been correct in its rulings and needs to be even more vigilent in protecting human copyright going forward. <br/><br/>
