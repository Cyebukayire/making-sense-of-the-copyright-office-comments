The current harm being caused by the unfettered and unregulated scraping of millions of citizens&#39; data cannot be overstated, and this will continue to get worse the longer it is allowed to continue.  I, my co-workers, my peers, and millions of others&#39; livelihoods are at risk due to the lack of regulations around AI.<br/><br/>AI models are not capable of creating or innovating anything new; they merely reuse and average out the data they&#39;ve been given.  They are thus unable to push innovation or business forward of their own merits; rather, they are a tool which is used to rob copyright owners and skilled individuals of their intellectual property and profit off of it without proper compensation.  This is also unable to be rectified legally; as per recent research, it is almost impossible to get an AI model to forget what it has been taught, meaning any scraping of copyrighted material is a permanent, uncorrectable harm.  Indeed, &quot;AI models&quot; in their current popularized forms, unless purpose-built to be trained ethically are less &quot;generative artificial intelligence&quot; and more &quot;plagiarism software&quot;.<br/><br/>AI &quot;creators&quot; also cannot claim to have some unique skillset, as they are merely typing keywords to guide the model, not producing the work themselves.  This makes them more akin to a customer requesting a commission, not someone producing a work they have the right to copyright.<br/><br/>To look for the grievous, almost solely malicious nature of the current unregulated state of AI, you need look no further than the likely flooding of this comment period with thousands of AI-generated comments made with learning language models, intended to sway opinion falsely.  These are not comments made by actual concerned citizens; they are a transparent attempt by a small segment of AI users to tilt the scales in favor of what is essentially their latest &quot;get-rich-quick&quot; scheme, where they are allowed to defraud as many creators as they&#39;d like, permanently, and profit off their work without repercussion.  Manipulation of this nature is not just opposed to the entire stated purpose of copyrights, but an affront to basic democratic principles.<br/><br/>AI work is inherently uncopyrightable, as no human can claim any true agency over the works it produces with full certainty.  Regulations regarding the ethical training of AI, the necessity of compensation for using copyrightable works, and rules for scraping of what would normally be considered &quot;publicly available information&quot; on a mass scale must be established, as our current regulation framework is insufficient to deal with these new forms of infringement.
