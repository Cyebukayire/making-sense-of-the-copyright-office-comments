The use of publicly available copyrighted material in training data is already a settled issue. GPS systems utilized maps made by others it did not create without permission. Your smart phones ability to read your text via voice or to take your voice and create text was built studying voices from other humans that it didn&#39;t have permission to use. There are medical devices that have been trained on the data of humans.<br/><br/>Humans reference other people&#39;s works of art to make their own. This is not a new process by any stretch of the imagination. Other countries are already ruling for the legal use of copyrighted materials in training sets. Not only does it follow existing practical uses and set precedent, but the longer we wait in limbo, the bigger advantage we give to other countries who have already settled this issue.<br/><br/>Existing copyright owners can bring individual claims against works they believe have infringed on them, but the outputs of these models is so transformative (unless intentionally prompted not to be) that they would never have a case. The copyright office should recognize the use of copyrighted materials in training sets at the earliest possible date.
