Hello, I am an engineer working in Texas. I am also an aspiring writer, animator, and composer who works largely online. I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. Unregulated AI is a threat because any online content can and is used to train AI without the creator&#39;s knowledge or consent. Then another individual and/or company can use someone else&#39;s intellectual property for profit. AI work would not exist without data (a human&#39;s art, voice, writing,etc) as a result, it should not be considered original work and should be heavily regulated to prevent smaller creators and individuals from being exploited. Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
