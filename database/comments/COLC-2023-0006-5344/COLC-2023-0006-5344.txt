Greetings. I am an animation artist, and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and the livelihoods of many like me. This technology has already done damage in the creative industries (writers, actors), and copyright holders have little to no recourse. <br/>If AI continues to be unregulated, millions of jobs will be stolen, quite literally, as AI is trained from human work. It is a threat to art, journalism, and entertainment that must be regulated. <br/>Regulations for this technology can ensure that it is used in the most responsible way possible. With regulations, copyright holders and creative workers will be protected while also not hindering innovation, as AI can be a helpful tool.<br/>Thank you for reading. I hope the right decision is made on behalf of multiple creative industries.
