Hello, I live in Ohio and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/><br/>This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse.<br/><br/>Unregulated AI is a threat because generative AI scrapes the internet for other people&#39;s creative works and uses them without permission.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.
