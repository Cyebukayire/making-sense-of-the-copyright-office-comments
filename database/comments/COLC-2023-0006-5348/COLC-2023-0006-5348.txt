I think AI is dangerous. It&#39;s clearly replacing jobs in multiple fields where a human touch is desperately needed. It&#39;s running rampant in schools and other learning organizations - and the detriment It&#39;s doing to young people is rapidly becoming unsustainable. There needs to be some sort of regulation on it, to where it doesn&#39;t replace jobs for a &quot;cheaper&quot; outcome that leaves millions unemployed.
