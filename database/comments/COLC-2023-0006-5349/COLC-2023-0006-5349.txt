I am a writer and a voiceover artist. I have several friends who are artists, actors, writers, and content creators. AI has no place in this world, and especially not in the format that it is currently used. ChatGPT, Midjourney, all of these...they&#39;ve *stolen* our hard work, our practice, our efforts, our voices and talents, and given them to people who only want to work enough to type one sentence into a file. It *should* be illegal to steal our voices and words and artwork and appearances. It&#39;s *theft*. Plagiarism. However, I know that battle is different than what you are seeking. You&#39;re seeking to see if AI produced artwork should be copyrightable by the &quot;creator&quot;. By the thief of our talents, scraped up from the source and force-fed into a blender to vomit out half-formed nonsense that doesn&#39;t give the actual creator of the source material - the writing, the art, the acting, the voice - any of the credit.<br/><br/>AI-created work should NOT be allowed to be copyrightable. Protect what rights we can. We&#39;ve worked hard for our talents. They want to take that away and create mass-produced slop. Please. Do not let them do this to art, writing, music, theater, film. Protect the rights of the humans who created this work that was STOLEN from us without our consent.
