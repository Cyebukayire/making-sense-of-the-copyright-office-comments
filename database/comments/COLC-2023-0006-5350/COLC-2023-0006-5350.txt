I am not a writer or copyright owner of anything. I am a consumer of media and a reader of many different copyright properties and works; usually consumed on my PC and on the internet. My opinion and worries about AI copyright issues is therefore, from the perceptive of a consumer, and I have spent a great many years on the internet from news sites to social media to forms of different kinds.<br/><br/>My main worry about the use of AI and the copyright issues associated, is the rising issue of misinformation online. The growing assortment of data and information on the internet is ever growing but, so too is false or misleading data or information. Whether intentional or not; whether incentivized by engagement and revenue or not; misinformation spreads throughout social media and beyond. From news articles or books of copy-written works, the ability of consumers to differentiate whether the works and media they are consuming is based in truth and facts or not, is becoming harder and harder.<br/><br/>This is not inherently an AI issue, but it is one I believe AI could affect in very negative ways, should proper precautions not be taken towards their use in copyright works of non-fiction; or in their transparency that AI was used to create or alter a piece of media in anyway.
