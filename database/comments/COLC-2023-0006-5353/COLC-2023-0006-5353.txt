AI shpuld not be allowed to copy or use people&#39;s art or words or ideas, especially without their permission. Furthermore, AI should stay away from art and literature and instead focus on problems like how to limit GHG and remove trash from the ocean, or how to make the energy used in a certain neighborhood sustainable. Why are we using AI to copy and create art or literature when instead we can use AI for tasks that are necessary and difficult for humans?
