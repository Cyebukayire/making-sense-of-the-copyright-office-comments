Artificial Intelligence has impacted many artists and creators across the globe. I believe that if used properly it can be a great tool, but it should never be used to make money as it is known to generate based off of current creations on the internet from artists and writers. It should never be applicable for copyright because of that information and there should be more regulations when it comes to using AI. Regulations such as only using images or creations found in the public domain on the internet is a good start. In general, artists and writers along with fellow creators who spend hours perfecting our crafts deserve more protection from AI--something that creates with just a button. It&#39;s a slap to the face for us who&#39;ve worked so hard to obtain our skills after so many years.
