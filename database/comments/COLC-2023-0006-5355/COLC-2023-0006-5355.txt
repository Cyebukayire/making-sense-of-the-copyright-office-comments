Hello, let me start by saying I am not an american citizen, but your laws also affect me directly. I am a brazillian artist but all services I use to sell my work follow american law first and foremost, and I can already see me and my friends losing our work to AI. Independent of the ethical and philosophical thoughts you may have on the subject, know this: too many people will lose their jobs. This isn&#39;t like workers breaking down treadmills in the 19th century, this is about 15% of the global population having no way to sell their services in the coming decades. The decision you make here isn&#39;t just about copyright law in your country, it&#39;s about shaping an industry for this entire century! Think about the future, not just the present, you might just prevent or allow an economic apocalypse to happen
