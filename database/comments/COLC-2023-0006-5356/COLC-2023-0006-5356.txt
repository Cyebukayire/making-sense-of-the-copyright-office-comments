Artificial intelligence is a scam meant to steal labor and sell it back to people without paying the people who did the work in the first place. Usage of any sources in training data should require consent, credit, and compensation. Anything less will completely destroy the mediums of writing, visual art, audio, and video forever. AI is incapable of generating anything that hasn&#39;t been made before, and can&#39;t be compared to any of the ways a human brain works.
