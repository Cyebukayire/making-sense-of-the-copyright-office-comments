Hello,<br/><br/>I am a professional in the field of computer graphics, having previously been employed at a multi-billion dollar gaming company on a research and development team solving problems related to CGI. I have also been an artist for over 10 years, having produced short films and having had my work displayed in exhibitions. I believe that my dual expertise in computer graphics and visual arts qualify me to comment on the topic of computer generated imagery, as I have both a broad understanding of the technical details of the software as well as an understanding of how the art community relates to it.<br/><br/>I am generally opposed to the notion that the output of &quot;AI&quot; models should be copyrightable. If the model is trained by the owner of the entire training corpus, then the developer of the model could also own the output. However, the volume of data required to create high quality models is so large that this is not feasible, and the end users of these models should never have a claim to the copyright of the output.<br/><br/>In a similar manner to linear regression (but within a very high dimensional context), these models produce a continuous, query-able database that interpolates between the elements of the training data. Each image in the training data (or rather, a very similar image) may or may not be found within the set of possible outputs, in the same way that a (x,y) data point may or may not lie on the line of best fit produced by a linear regression model. It&#39;s intractable to determine how closely a generated image resembles any input data. This makes enforcing the rights of the original copyright holders (of the training data) difficult or impossible.<br/><br/>Once a model has finished the training process, all possible outputs of the model have already been created, having been encoded in the latent space of the model. So, while the common parlance uses the term &quot;prompt,&quot; it is not the correct term for the user input to these models. Rather, &quot;query&quot; is a more appropriate term - users are querying for some location in the latent space of the model and being given the corresponding output image. No new information is created, strictly speaking, by users of these models. Some might argue that users are &quot;photographing&quot; the digital latent space, but that&#39;s not a fair comparison - photographers have much more human input (composition, lighting, directing, and so on). Users of these models are not actually creating any new information, only accessing it. There is nothing for them to copyright.<br/><br/>I sincerely believe that advocates of generative AI often do not understand the technology well enough to see how it violates the rights of the copyright holders of the training data; one can safely dismiss anyone who claims the models learn to create art &quot;just like people do&quot;, which is a common sentiment which betrays a misunderstanding of both the technology and of human nature. Or rather, some advocates do understand the technology, but misrepresent it due to potential personal economic gain.<br/><br/>I will qualify my claimed technical expertise on generative software by saying that I have never worked directly with them professionally, I have only studied them and gained knowledge about them due to working in adjacent sub-fields. However, I would advise that those few who have worked to develop such models have a clear bias towards incentivizing their use.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
