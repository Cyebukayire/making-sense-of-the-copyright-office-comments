AI technology as it exists now is essentially an advanced form or collage technology that operates by recognizing patterns based on data training sets and replicating those patterns. Data used in AI training should be heavily regulated as most AI learning programs now are the result of thousands of data sets being scraped and input into the technology without the consent of the data sets&#39; original owners. As it is now, the lack of regulation of AI technology is leading to massive amounts of theft as people&#39;s data such as their voices, pictures, and creative works are being used to train AI learning programs without their consent. I believe that AI works should not be copyrighted because they lack human creativity. They are ultimately the result of the a machine being told to fulfill prompts based on replicating data sets that have been fed into the machine. There is no element of human creativity or originality in AI works. Furthermore, AI works should not be given copyright protections when many AI learning programs now are being trained by being fed using data such as visual art, books, or audio that are themselves having their copyright protections violated when they are input into AI learning programs without the legal consent of the original creators.
