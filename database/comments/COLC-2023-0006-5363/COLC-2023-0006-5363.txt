Ai produced output without human collaboration should not be able to receive a copyright. Quite simply, a prompt is a request for a virtual commission, delivered to the author of the prompt via artificial intelligence. The prompt itself can be copyrighted, but not the output. A artist, composer, writer etc imagines the final result. A prompt requests imagination from the algorithm. That&rsquo;s the rub. Imagination generates copyright, and by that logic, artificial intelligent outputs cannot be copy written because a human did not imagine the output. They asked a machine to imagine something.
