Artificial intelligence is unsustainable. It is a drain on creativity and detrimental to the livelihoods of people who make their lives through creativity. Artificial intelligence, unlike human creators, cannot create anything new. It depends on input from human creators to function and grow. If artificial intelligence is fed too much input that was also created by artificial intelligence, its output becomes worse. While human creators also reference the work of others and use it as inspiration, these creators add their own talent, style, and experience to their work, resulting in works that create a richer artistic world. This is unlike AI, whose creations can only be derivative.<br/><br/>We need to proceed with caution when it comes to AI, in a way that will allow art and creativity to flourish.
