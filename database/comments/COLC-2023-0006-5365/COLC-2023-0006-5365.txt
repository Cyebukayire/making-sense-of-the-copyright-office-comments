Generative AI is being used at present by larger corporations to cut costs and time on production. This is not inherently a bad thing. However, in order for these corps to generate this content they need data to feed the AI.<br/><br/>More often than not these corporations are obtaining copyrighted images, voices, and videos from online. Mainly without permission, no credit, no residuals or compensation.<br/><br/>Next are, in the instance of voice actors, the issues with bodily autonomy. By adding someone&#39;s voice to a data bank you&#39;re able to make them say anything. Not only does this strip voice actors of their roles but consider the legal implications during court when people use a fabricated phone call for evidence against someone.<br/><br/>The internet is an open source, yes, but all content uploaded to it is still protected by copyright law. The only data that generative ai needs to be fed is user made content. For example: an independent artist using their own art to teach a program to create images in their own unique style to minimize the amount of time it takes for them to get through their orders. This is good. <br/><br/>This is not good: an independent creator is feeding a generative ai program images from their favorite artists and selling them online.<br/><br/>You could argue that this is a derivative work but there&#39;s the issue of ethics. In this hypothetical situation the creator did not receive consent from these artists to feed into the ai, nor did they get consent to sell these works. Most independent artists have both a Terms of Service and a Terms of Use policy for their works.<br/><br/>What it boils down to is that generative ai is a very grey area. With a mixture of people who are either scared of the implications (loss of jobs) and are against ai, those who would willingly cut out creatives on a production team to cut costs and raise profit are for ai. Then you have people like me.<br/><br/>I see where AI has its place. However, I do not see it being used in an appropriate manner. I ask that those reviewing these comments look for the humanity, and not the expected flood of bot comments saying how great AI is.<br/><br/>It can be, when used appropriately, but until guidelines are put in place it&#39;s doing nothing but breeding a hostile community.<br/><br/>Best regards.
