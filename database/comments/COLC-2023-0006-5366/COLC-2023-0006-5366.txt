AI art uses methods in which the program takes already existing works of art made from real humans and twists it into whatever it needs, weither the AI uses someone&#39;s artstyle or creative, and theres no laws protecting artist or their art from this happening, it effects job, hobbies, and careers.<br/>AI writing is of the same subject expect it can also effect education programs in the form of students submitting AI writing in for assignments, theres no yet a solution to this problem.<br/>AI deepfakes has to be the worst offender of this list, in which faces are taken from real people, mostly public figures, and are used to make them look like they&#39;re doing things they have never done. Deepfake porn negatively effecting women socially and damaging their careers, deepfakes being used for political figures to make them say and do problematic things that can cause public outrage, and much more.<br/>AI voices are on the same level as deepfakes but i would say this is more dangerous because of how steading the technology for ai voices are improving, and added on the fact that you dont need anyone&#39;s face to use it to your advantage.
