Piracy. Noun. Definition: The unauthorized use or reproduction of another&#39;s work. <br/><br/>Imagine, if you would, that you are an artist. You have loved drawing since you were young, and that love has given way to the desire to hone your craft. After years of study of human and animal anatomy, fur patters, physics, design, color theory, etc... you have finally developed a style that is your own and recognizable enough that people want to pay good money for the work you do. That work you do helps pay the bills, keep a roof over your head, and food on your table. <br/>Now imagine that, with the new AI problem, your art that you post online to help bring in more clients is being taken without your permission and used to feed an AI. That AI is now recreating your style, and the AI prompt user is claiming your style is theirs and they are now making a profit off of your works. Perhaps they&#39;re getting commissions like you are, or perhaps they&#39;re selling items with your impersonated style on them, or perhaps they&#39;re using your style to land a digital art career while claiming the art is their own. Hiding the fact that it is a recreation using AI. <br/>With unregulated AI, this is a glaring problem within the art community and it will only continue to grow without laws to bring irresponsible AI users to heel. What is more, this picture I have painted for you is only the very tip of the monumental iceburg of problems unregulated AI has caused. It should not be considered unreasonable to create regulations that would protect artists and copyright holders from piracy at the hands of irresponsible and unconscionable AI users.
