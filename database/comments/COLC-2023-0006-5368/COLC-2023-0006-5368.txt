My comments are longer than 5000 characters please see the below summary and I have attached the complete discussion.<br/><br/>Summary of the paper:<br/>In this comment paper I attempt to investigate the use of copyrighted materials to train an Artificial Intelligence here after referred to as &quot;AI&quot; and how the laws regarding this should be considered.  The paper will concentrate on how AI technologies interact with creative works and if they infringe on copyright rules. I have personally investigated how AI&#39;s underlying mechanisms, processes, could possibly be influenced by copyright-protected content. I will demonstrate how AI-generated material may survive within the framework of existing copyright rules without infringing on them by analyzing key aspects such as originality, human involvement, and transformative use. I have highlight how AI-generated content can coexist within the framework of existing copyright laws.<br/>
