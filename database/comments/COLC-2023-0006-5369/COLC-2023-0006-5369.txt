I am strongly against AI in copyright and agree with the judge who ruled that AI cannot hold copyright. Artists like myself deserve to not have our intellectual property poached and repackaged by AI grifters. Without proper rules and regulations, AI only encourages theft. We are at a juncture where the majority of artists are living month to month and they should not have their financial stability kneecapped by tech enthusiasts who would take their work and use it as fodder. We have already seen these people take from disabled and deceased artists and then claim that their theft is irreversible because it has already been added to the blockchain, the cloud, the large language learning model, etc. We need protections and we need them now.<br/>Large media conglomerates are talking about using actors&#39; likenesses via AI ad infinitum without paying beyond an initial recording session. People are publishing books with images generated by MidJourney and text from ChatGPT. Employers are salivating about the opportunity to cut employees, their wages, and pass down the savings to themselves.<br/>Our country is in crisis. The wealth gap has widened immensely and we need to support workers, not rich tech bros. Artists enrich communities and the world as a whole. We deserve to not have our work exploited and repackaged for the profits of the 1%.
