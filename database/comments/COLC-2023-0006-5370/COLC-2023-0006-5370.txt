To whomever it may concern,<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly believe that laws surrounding copyright make AI generated content illegal. As it stands, AI generated art and AI generated animation unlawfully download and copy small independent artists and businesses to create their product. The images used in &quot;training&quot; AI are stolen and then mashed together with other stolen art to &quot;create&quot; AI art. Since the AI is just taking parts of the stolen imagery and not actually learning, and then mashing it together it is should be completely unlawful. The artists that have their work taken are not compensated, or even alerted that their work has been stolen until much later. These thefts quantifiably injure those artists who they steal from, as the businesses themselves lose customers due to AI &quot;art&quot; giving away it&#39;s stolen work for free. Strengthening copyright rules around AI would benefit everyone in the long run, and preserve the culture so many respect in art.<br/><br/>Best wishes.
