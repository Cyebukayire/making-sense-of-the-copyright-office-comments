AI theft has gotten so severe, once flourishing artist communities and jobs born from artists creating and sharing pieces they&#39;ve made, is now becoming scarce. Creators that put years into learning the skills and spent hundreds to thousands to learn or sank into educational debt, are now stripped and struggling.<br/><br/>Imagine, working for years on your craft and spending hours to days, to weeks, working on a piece, being proud and having a supportive community. To have built up and mastered being able to create almost anything, even things that don&#39;t exist. Sometimes the pay is low but we are happy. Sometimes we make a comfortable living.<br/><br/>And some lazy, unimaginative people put together a program that does the &quot;creating&quot; for them, pulling from the projects you spent years working, perfecting, and selling, against your will and knowledge, and put it out there that they will still steal what you make and sell plagiarized copies, or the ability to make plagiarized copies. And their petty program nets them thousands to millions without doing any work, while the actual artists, who made this program work at all, aren&#39;t compensated. We are forcibly opted in, stolen from, then told the false lie that we can &quot;opt out&quot; after the first round of theft is done. This program isnt making anything new on consented assets. It is splicing from artists they STOLE YEARS and HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS with of dollars worth of work from.<br/><br/>So many don&#39;t want to create anymore. Some can&#39;t make a living anymore. Some losing jobs they&#39;ve been in for years. <br/><br/>Theft has always been punishable. Especially high dollar amount theft. So why are any of these AI CEOs and programmers, scrapers, and people uploading things that don&#39;t belong to them, allowed to get away with it? <br/><br/>My sketches sold for $200 each. I&#39;ve drawn hundreds of sketches. So, if they stole even 10, that&#39;s $2000 in theft. <br/><br/>That&#39;s just for me. Now add up every single artist and their galleries. The dollar amount stolen, is unbelievably high.<br/><br/>Please regulate, and instill severe punishment.
