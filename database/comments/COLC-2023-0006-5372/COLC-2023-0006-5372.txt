For my comment I am going to be addressing points 1 and 4 of the Notice, based on my personal knowledge of the technology and what I have seen of its use.<br/><br/>For point 1, From what I know from the very beginning of the AI being available and it sparking controversy on the internet, generative AI such as Midjourney have scrapped the entire internet for their datasets, without any permission from the copyright holders. It&#39;s so bad, there&#39;s websites out there to reverse image search the datasets for if you have had your artwork taken for training (most prominently, haveibeentrained.com, which also shows the direct URL an image was taken from, and the title the image was given on the origin website). As much as the creator of Midjourney would like to claim it is &quot;Impossible to find an image&#39;s source&quot;, it is very easy to reverse image search on the internet, and there&#39;s evidence with the keyword systems of the AI that the origin of the artworks are known by the model in order to recreate a certain artist&#39;s style. I believe that the owners of the AI datasets blatant disrespect of the copyright holder&#39;s works from all across the internet was a hasty and apathetic decision, and thus for remuneration to be possible, the AI datasets must be remade from the ground up with permission granted for every copyrighted material, in order to set up pay distribution. I believe this is necessary because as it stands now, the datasets are filled with images from the famous and well known artists, to the small and practically invisible artists, to literal corporate promotional material. The datasets are so bloated that while tracking down the origin of every artwork is 100% possible, being able to contact every single artist to ask about compensation and opting out of the dataset may not be. If the datasets are forced to be remade, this will allow the AI&#39;s owners to individually contact an artist about use before it is implemented, and if the artist denies the request or does not respond, it shall not be included.<br/><br/>For point 4, I would like to bring up that while AI mimicking the likeness and voices of people may implicate varying state rights of publicity and unfair competition law, it is also a potential liability for identity theft on a whole new level than before. We have seen AI be used to mimic voices of various people, to almost perfection. Now, what stops someone from making an AI from any person with an online or televised presence, and then calling their bank with that AI voice? Many banks have voice calls as a form of verification, and AI can completely circumvent that if one wanted to. We also have seen AI that imposes someone&#39;s likeness onto another video (known as &quot;Deepfakes&quot;), and while that has mostly been used for silly videos or pornography, nothing stops a person with malicious intentions from gathering a library of someone&#39;s face, and then along with an AI voice, faking an entire video call with an organization. Therefore, I think heavier obligations need to be imposed on this form of technology, even if those obligations do not come from the copyright office and instead are from another branch of lawmaking. The ability for anyone to perfectly mimic someone else&#39;s voice or likeness is too loose of a legal canon to remain as it is.
