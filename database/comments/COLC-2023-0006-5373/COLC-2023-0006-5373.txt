I think it is good and correct that &quot;AI&quot; creations shouldn&#39;t be copyrightable. I&#39;m wary of the specific language that it&#39;s because &quot;a human didn&#39;t make it,&quot; but I do firmly believe that &quot;AI&quot; is just an automated form of plagiarism that endangers the livelihoods of creators and performers for the benefit of rich business and tech investors. &quot;AI&quot; should be firmly regulated to protect workers in creative industries, whether they be artists, writers, or actors. <br/><br/>I would also suggest the regulations drop the term &quot;AI&quot;, which tech bros are pushing to mislead the public into believing these algorithms are real intelligent beings, which is not that case. Redefining these terms as &quot;machine learning&quot; or &quot;algorithmically generated&quot; would help make laymen understand the real circumstances. These &quot;AI&quot; are essentially just a new form of chatbot, and we shouldn&#39;t let tech investors grift their way into giving their chatbots rights.
