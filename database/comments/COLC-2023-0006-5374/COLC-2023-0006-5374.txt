AI can not have rights to be copyrighted. Basically the information it uses must be based on someone else&#39;s existence or work, therefore it is not original, and stealing from someone else words and experience without permission. Anything that come from AI is from a program, that someone else inputted, and it is then stealing without consent. I&#39;m surprised this even is considered a survey, as it should be a no brainer that is can not be legal.
