Thank you for opening this issue for public comment! I am an artist who publishes their work online, and while AI -generated works are a worry, I think that passing copyright laws to restrict it could make things worse. If AI is not allowed to be trained on copyrighted works, then humans not being allowed to take inspiration from copyrighted works is not a very large step. I do also believe that if it is explicit that it only applies to AI, then dissallowing the use of copyrighted works without explicit permission would protect many artists and authors. I also think it would make sense for machine-generated works to be public domain by default, unless they were created using works that require other licensing (such as those under certain Creative Commons licenses.) Overall, I think that restricting use of copyrighted works by AI is a good idea, but could easily lead to worse outcomes later down the line.
