I do not believe that AI should be considered copyrightable. Many AI systems, such as ChatCPT, and OpenAI, are trained on data pulled from the world-wide web, data which can be easily accessed by anyone in possession of an Internet connection. As there is no way to easily verify the sources of said data and whether its contents are copyrighted by another entity, copyrightable AI works would conflict with works already under preexisting copyright. In addition, the current widespread accessibility of AI means that anyone can use and publish works with AI-based tools. All AI-based work being considered copyrightable could lead to several complications as to who is responsible for the work&#39;s creation, and without a direct means of identifying whether the work is considered AI-based or not, it would unnecessarily complicate who or what is responsible for its legal ownership. Non-copyrightable AI works as they currently exist are unlikely to be exploited by bad faith parties or individuals who wish to take ownership of any AI-based work, nor would it cause any confusion as to who legally owns a copyrighted work.
