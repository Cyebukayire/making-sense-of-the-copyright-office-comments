I say the following as a professional researcher in the field of applied AI. Copyright is in place to protect humans and their works, this has been the unequivocal purpose of copyright law since its invention. To apply copyright protection to AI generated work which in its very basis is created by sampling from existing bodies of work, often which is done so without the consent of these original copyright holders, is a bastardization of the law and its purpose to protect human creators. To provide safe harbor to these machine generated works, or even those simply made majority my computers, cannot be let to happen.
