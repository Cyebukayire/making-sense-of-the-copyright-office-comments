1. AI art should not be copyrightable. It is created by a non-human entity, and it sources data in a method that is near impossible to protect from utilizing copyrighted material. If it does source copyrighted material, it becomes difficult to prove if companies are uncooperative.<br/><br/>Simply editing and polishing AI Art should not be enough to grant copyright. One cannot gain a copyright by photobashing various copyrighted materials if the end product resembles the originals. Likewise, one should not be allowed to claim work as their own if their collaged-together piece resembles the ones generated by AI.<br/><br/>2. If an AI generative model violates copyright by producing something substantially similar to an existing work, then the provider and user can be held accountable. The provider more so, as they are responsible for their product. A user can be responsible as well if they intentionally create a work similar to an existing one.<br/><br/>3. AI likenesses that replicate the voices or likenesses of individuals must be published with a prominent label that they are AI. If the likeness used is physical, then timestamps of when the AI is used must be easily accessible by the media&#39;s audience. If it is aural (voice), then a transcript of the voice lines that were generated must be provided.<br/><br/>Failure to do this results in potential suits, such as libel, and should be a violation of the law. Currently, it is impossible to copyright creations of nature: voices and faces. But intentional misdirection via impersonation is still a crime. <br/><br/>
