Forward:<br/><br/>I have read your notice Artificial Intelligence and Copyright, and watched your webinar event International Copyright Issues and Artificial Intelligence, which was an excellent early step, great job!<br/><br/>Although I am commenting as an individual, I consider myself an expert broadly in computer technologies, and well-informed on AI generative technologies beginning with the AI chatbot A.L.I.C.E in the early 2000s. I have used many generative AI models for computer code, prose, images, and music. I have published software on Github using AI assistance for a minority portion of the work (to help port code from C# to C). I intend to use AI image generation as a starting point for some artwork in future projects. I am also concerned about AI copyright issues regarding how regulations may affect various creative industries I enjoy the fruits of.<br/><br/>Feedback:<br/><br/>First Issue:<br/>A) I believe the use of copyrighted material for AI training data should be fair use.<br/>  a) If it were not so, I fear companies that buy intellectual property rights would have grossly more control over industries than they already do. Copyright is already far too strong, with more damaging impacts than it was meant to have.<br/>  b) The concern that AI may reproduce work from its training data is a separate issue regarding how much the work has been transformed by human effort, and should not inform any decision about training dataset regulation. Refer to how filming a movie showing in a theater is infringing, but camcorder R&amp;D is not.<br/>  c) I do think it is moral to provide details about the development of any AI model, including its training dataset contents. This helps the technologies develop, serve all humanity, and follow our changing values on these issues. I don&#39;t see a need for copyright to be involved, but I am generally in favor of rules such as those in the EU AI Act which increase transparency in these areas.<br/><br/>Second Issue:<br/>B) I propose a thought experiment. Consider Jane, who spends hours to days learning an AI image generation model and its settings to the point that she produces a single image she&#39;s been hoping for. Consider this image has complex and unique composition. (Note: AI image generation models are very bad at originality in composition, e.g &quot;a woman hoeing soil atop a train car&quot; will never produce what humans can easily imagine.) I feel that Jane&#39;s image would be a unique accomplishment of human effort, and it would be a shame for her to not have the rights naturally expected to an accomplishment of creation.<br/><br/>So I think there is a point where a work should be copyrightable simply with enough time and effort spent to produce it. I don&#39;t know how best to measure it, but the threshold should<br/>  a) be high enough that it is unprofitable for corporations and individuals to mass produce AI works that push unique works out of contention.<br/>  b) never greatly burden individual artists when they must justify that their work is indeed over the threshold.<br/><br/>Third Issue:<br/>I cannot comment on the third issue with much insight because I am not very familiar with existing copyright liability regulation, but I&#39;ll comment on the example given about an output found to be similar to a copyrighted work:<br/><br/>I would expect copyright infringement risk taken on by the user of an automation tool can be remedied by another automation tool, or component of the original tool, which simply checks for similarity to copyrighted works in general, or in the training dataset. As long as there is a need for such automation (if a liability risk exists), it shouldn&#39;t be very difficult for users to clear themselves of that liability. So it would be okay for the liability to fall on the user and not condemn the generation tool or the one who made it. In the case that a claim of similarity to an independent work is made, I&#39;d expect it can be handled the way such cases have traditionally been handled, which I presume is by examination whether the new work was indeed independent. And if such cases arise too frequently, I suggest reducing the protective power of copyright itself to accommodate a modern, healthy, productive society of individuals. Or retry solving automation with automation where you can, so we producers can get on with producing.<br/><br/>Thank you for gathering feedback for consideration.
