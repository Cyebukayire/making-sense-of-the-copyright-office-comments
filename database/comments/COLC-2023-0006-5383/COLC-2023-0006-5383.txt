As a freelance illustrator I am very concerned about the use of AI generated art.<br/>AI software is trained on various art found online without the artist&rsquo;s permission or knowledge, which violates the copyright of the individual artists who created that work. While my expertise is in illustration I imagine other creative fields like fine art, music and writing face the same issues. Individual creators need to have their work protected by our governing body. The arts are what elevates humans to a rich cultural society and community, please protect the rights of creators!
