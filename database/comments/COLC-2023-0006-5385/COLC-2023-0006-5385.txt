I&#39;m twenty years old. I&#39;ve seen many different ideas from older generations reinvent themselves, and present themselves as new. Battletech, Star Wars, Blade Runner, and The Matrix are few examples on a long list of IPs that have been reimagined into something more appealing to modern audiences. These ideas have been created by people, and not machines. To quote and paraphrase Jan Misali, a mathematician I respect; <br/><br/>&quot;you know how when you have a bunch of data plotted on a graph you can find the &ldquo;best-fit line&rdquo;?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;defining a line only uses two parameters (mx+b), but the thing is that if you make a more complicated function with more parameters to play around with (as long as you&rsquo;re clever about it), you can define a relatively-simple mathematical equation that gets arbitrarily close to any data, no matter how messy that data is! you can just keep adding more parameters until you have enough to model the complexity of the given data.<br/><br/>now, the more parameters you have the more expensive it is computationally to find what configuration of all the parameters gets your fancy approximation as close to the data as possible (there are some linear algebra and calculus tricks that help!), but depending on the application, you can use this sort of method to get good-enough approximations to whatever data it is that you want to model!<br/><br/>however, this doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve actually found the underlying meta-pattern. it&rsquo;s just a fancier version of looking at data you&rsquo;ve already seen and drawing lines between points to interpolate between things. any approximation made this way will be in a sense &ldquo;smoother&rdquo; than what it&rsquo;s modeling, always predicting (for this application) that the next number in the sequence is the &ldquo;average&rdquo; in some sense of all the things that could come next, gravitating towards the most default and &ldquo;boring&rdquo; patterns. &quot;<br/><br/>This excerpt of his post on Tumblr demonstrates that AI language models generate their language skills from advanced forms of data interpolation with multiple parameters. Importantly, this excerpt mentions that the AI language model requires input data to create content. As far as I understand conceptually, data and recorded information legally belongs to specific individuals, which is the basis of copyright laws. Therefore, as AI require data to generate new information, I would make the argument that the rights over those individual sets of data used to train the AI are owned by whomever created them. This is important because AI do not make new pieces of art like humans do. The act of AI generation is completely different to the creation of art by a human process,  as human art is non-deterministic. As explained above, data is used to interpolate sets of multiple items to create art. This demonstrates that the results of an AI art generator are theoretically repeatable if the same items are submitted to an identical process with no random generation. As this would constitute directly using copyrighted data for image creation, the owners of the data would require sufficient compensation, and the AI art could not be used or market without express consent from the original image&#39;s copyright holder.<br/><br/>Essentially, to summarize; AI art directly uses copyrighted data/information when creating works and compensation must be paid to the supplier of that data.<br/><br/>Citation:<br/>Misali, J.
