Artificial intelligence has become more prevalent in our everyday lives and has no regulation or statute regarding how it should be used. It has interrupted many industries and has disrupted the integrity of creativity from across different platforms.  It will forever change how we perceive reality from non reality. This is why we need our government to start addressing this issue before it becomes a problem for humanity.  Before AI, there was a plethora of creativity, but with AI, it has replaced creativity with mundane ideas and even imitating human beings.  We do not want our lives to be dictated by an illusion of what is not even considered a fabric of a human being.  This will be an issue that will have dire and inevitable consequences if not addressed with rules and limitations.
