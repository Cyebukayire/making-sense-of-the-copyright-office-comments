In the debate against AI, many discuss the immoral use of non-consenting artists work, or the impact on global industries, and while that discussion should be had, in the world of legality when it comes to AI, it should not be able to be copyrighted because &ldquo;creation&rdquo; itself is not happening by the participating person. To preface, I will mostly be discussing AI image generation as I myself am an artist and it&rsquo;s the process I understand the most technologically, though the argument is applicable to most generative AIs.<br/><br/> Often, the debate is muddied because the words we use to describe an artist making something is the same words we use to describe an AI&rsquo;s generational process. Words like &ldquo;create&rdquo;, &ldquo;original product&rdquo;, and &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; are all used, but when you get down to it, those words don&rsquo;t feel wholly accurate. These terms are all things only humans can do currently, inspiration is not something a computer calculates in the same way humans&rsquo; brains do. We simply don&rsquo;t have unique terms yet to describe what&rsquo;s actually going on, which is a person writes a sentence, and a computer blends countless images to show you something that it has been taught is what your words mean. It is easy to compare it to a simple Google images search; you write a description of what you want to see and the computer knows what that means, and shows you images it knows are related to those words. We cannot copyright any image we see upon a search simply because we wrote a sentence that allowed a computer to fetch that image for us. <br/><br/>The only difference is AI goes a step further with its learning model to give you one cohesive image that is so muddied you can&rsquo;t identify every piece clearly. There is no act of creation in the process by the human other than the sentence written initially. To be copyrighted, the person attempting the copyright had to have created it themselves. As a thought experiment, let&rsquo;s say we teach a dog to hold a paintbrush and move it where we direct it to. Whatever painting results, cannot be copyrighted by the person directing the dog because even though the person told the dog what to paint and where, the dog still did it. You may have told an AI what to make, but the computer made it and even beyond that, the computer made it from countless artists who may not even know their work is being used to train the AI. <br/><br/>In conclusion, because AI generation is not an original creation by a human hand, it cannot be copyrighted by that person. Of course, the argument goes far beyond what I&rsquo;ve mentioned here and it&rsquo;s a deeply complex problem that needs to be viewed from many angles I did not mention here. This decision on copyright will have global permanent effects on our industry everywhere. I urge of you to make the wise, educated, and upstanding decision even if it isn&rsquo;t the option that saves companies the most money. Thank you for your time.
