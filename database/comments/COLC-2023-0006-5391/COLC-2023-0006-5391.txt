I am writing today to say that I think that works created AI should not be copyrightable. They are made of images and creations created by humans but what they make is an amalgamation. Just like inserting letters into a randomizer does not make a new word, inserting pieces of previously copyrightable work does not make it copyrightable. Copyright is law to drive innovation. AI can not create it can only copy. I urge you to please keep works generated by AI out of copyright.
