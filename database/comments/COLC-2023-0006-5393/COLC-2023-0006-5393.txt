Reasonable regulation is needed on AI for a number of reasons, the main one being copyright protection. Currently, harm has already been done in several fields, including but not limited to art, acting, voice acting, and music. Unregulated AI not only can be used to easily infringe on copyrighted material, but also used to take jobs away from hardworking citizens who have dedicated their life to that field. Regulating, but not completely prohibiting, AI will both protect the copyrights and livelyhoods of the people in the affected fields and allow for further innovation with the technology that helps society rather than harms it.
