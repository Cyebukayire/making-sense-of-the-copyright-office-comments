I am a working artist and art instructor, and I have encountered a number of issues with AI-mainly, the utilization of &ldquo;AI&rdquo; image generation from unapproved source material. There is currently an insufficient amount of legal clarity and protection for visual artists, so if &ldquo;AI&rdquo; image and text generation software is to be ubiquitous, artists need better definitions of legal protections for their work. &ldquo;AI&rdquo; should be heavily regulated and monitored in order for the owner of intellectual property to be defined. If owners of intellectual properties (in most cases, creators) opt in to allow their work to be source by content-generating software, they should be compensated for the rights thereof. Also, these protections should be accessible to artists and it should imperative that they are informed of their rights. The same transparency should be available with any generation, processing information, and display of content involved with any such content generation software.
