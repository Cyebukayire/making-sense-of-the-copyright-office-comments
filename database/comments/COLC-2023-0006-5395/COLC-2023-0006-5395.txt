I personally believe AI created works should not be copyrightable. Or Trademarkable for that matter. The technology is simply unethical. A lot of people depend on their creative skills (drawing, voice acting, music, etc.) to make a living. AI threatens to put all of these people out of jobs, which could easily threaten the economy. Plus, You can never convince me a machine can create masterpieces like Fullmetal Alchemist, Chainsaw Man, or Avatar: The Last Airbender.
