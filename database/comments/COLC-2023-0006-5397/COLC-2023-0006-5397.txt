AI is nothing but a slop machine that spits out inherently derivative, plagiaristic garbage. I do not and will never, as an artist, consent to my work being used to pad someone else&#39;s checkbook&mdash; a person who is likely anti-art; a person who believes that art&#39;s purpose is to make money. Art is about expressing and interpreting the human experience. AI-generated &quot;content&quot; cannot be copywrited because it adds nothing and steals everything. It steals the work of people who put their heart and soul into their creation and churns out bland, corporate mush to pad the wallets of people who treat real art with disdain and contempt.
