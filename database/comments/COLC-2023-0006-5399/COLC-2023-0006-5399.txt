This current &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is just plagiarism software! As someone who works in the creative field, every day I learn something horrifying, ie Google is scraping my words from Google Docs, or actors performances are being copied against their will. Or books copied from other people are put up with fake authors. Or that my job application is being subjected to an AI program, when I know AI is racist and sexist because of how it is programmed currently! What is called &quot;AI&quot; needs far more regulation in its current state - and should be called what is is, Plagiarism Software! Not a fan of it!
