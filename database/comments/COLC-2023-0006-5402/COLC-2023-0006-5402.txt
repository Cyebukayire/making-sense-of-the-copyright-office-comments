(The use of copyrighted works to train AI models)<br/>It should only be done with the full understanding and consent of the copyright holder. There should be a legally binding contract involved, where compensation can also be decided.<br/><br/>(The copyrightability of material generated using AI systems)<br/>The only time this should be possible is when AI systems become sentient and are legally considered full persons. This will not happen, so copyrighting AI generated material should not be possible.<br/><br/>(Potential liability for infringing works generated using AI systems)<br/>Assuming the copyright holder did not sign a contract allowing the use of their work, it should be treated similarly to infringement of copyright. In some cases, money does not change hands, but damage is still done to the copyright holder in ways similar to piracy.<br/><br/>(The treatment of generative AI outputs that imitate the identity or style of human artists)<br/>Assuming the human artist did not sign a contract allowing the use of their work, it should be treated as stealing someone&#39;s identity, and potentially as slander (such as if the output is of something that would damage the reputation of the human artist).<br/><br/>(Impact on useful arts)<br/>AI scraping and stealing work from artists discourages the creation of new work by humans, both by existing artists who lose motivation in the face of AI, and by potential artists who will not pursue the personal creation of art also because of lost motivation, or because they&#39;re using AI generated artwork instead of creating their own. No matter how you look at it, I feel that it&#39;s a negative impact that will see less and less art created by humans.<br/><br/>As an artist who has dabbled in many mediums, I don&#39;t feel comfortable with AI using my work to then regurgitate at someone else&#39;s whim and for someone else&#39;s profit. Not only does it hurt the livelihood of artists, but it also soullessly takes and transforms their work against their wishes. It is wholly different from sincerely made fan art. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that there should be a requirement for every creator or copyright holder whose work is used for training AI to sign a contract allowing their work to be used. It should only be done with the individual&#39;s full understanding and consent. Using humans&#39; work or likeness without their consent should be illegal.
