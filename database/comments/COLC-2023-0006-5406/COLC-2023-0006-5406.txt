My name is Chip Godwin, I&rsquo;m an actor, writer, musician, filmmaker, and a member of SAG-AFTRA and Actor&rsquo;s Equity unions. Artificial Intelligence poses a threat to human art forms in myriad ways, not the least of which is copyright fraud, but it&rsquo;s also not the most important. The most important thing is preserving art itself. Any art that is not made for humans BY humans, is not art at all, but a grotesque  facsimile of what art used to be. There is no artificial &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; when it comes to art, there is only regurgitated and stolen ideas, ceaseless repetition and soulless, meaningless content. It will not take long for centuries of humanity&rsquo;s best works to be wiped out by the volume these machines will produce. If we can&rsquo;t use artificial intelligence for the good of mankind then it shouldn&rsquo;t be used at all. We have the power in a Democracy to stop such things, so if anyone has any doubt, put it on the ballot and let the people decide. As artists, we are not here to serve the financial interests of a few greedy souls, we are here to serve the interests of all humankind. Thank you.
