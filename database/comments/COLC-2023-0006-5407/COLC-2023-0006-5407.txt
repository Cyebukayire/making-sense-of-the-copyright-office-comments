As a NONPROFIT writer of both original and derivative fiction, I am expected to adhere to copyright laws and must appropriately cite AND/OR compensate other creators whenever I use their work. I am also required to request permission for the use of their work if I use it to profit (be it financially or through exposure) or it may interfere with their profits. AI must, in good conscience, acquire consent for any use, credit ALL artists involved, and offer compensation for commercial use. If AI corporations are unwilling to abide by those rules, they are unwilling to respect the rights of the human artists whose work is being used and are additionally asking to not be held to the same standard as any other individual, group, business, or industry. Technology can not and should not held to a lesser ethical standard than a human under any circumstances. I hope that, even if you, the government, do not prioritize the wellbeing and interests of artists, you should prioritize the rights of humans to fair compensation and ownership of their labor. AI can not be &ldquo;inspired,&rdquo; nor can it &ldquo;interpret&rdquo; data in a way comparable to humans. It can only reproduce that which has been shown. Otherwise, AI would not struggle to produce anatomically correct hands, poses, and proportions, nor would it promote itself as reproducing the styles of other artists, and it would NOT copy an artist&rsquo;s watermark and put it on its own work. (If you are unfamiliar, a watermark is a symbol or signature that can be used to identify the creator of a piece of artwork). This theft. It is lazy and unapologetic theft that prefers to call itself lucrative and innovative.
