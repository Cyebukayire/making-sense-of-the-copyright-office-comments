AI is going to destroy all things creative, as well as destroy a very large number of jobs in the United States. We&#39;re already seeing is in the Writer&#39;s Strike. People behind AI are, right now, stealing and plagiarising the intellectual property to create works that they are then trying to pass off. People using AI are stealing from others, and it is getting rapidly out of hand. <br/><br/>One of the reasons it&#39;s not AS BIG now is because the AI software isn&#39;t as smart. Soon, sooner than I think most realize, it will be good enough no one can tell. This is an extremely big problem for creatives. Every writer, every artist, ever graphic designer, and CGI artist, and musician, and onwards. There is not reason to believe anyone in these professions will be kept on when a computer can do their job cheaper.
