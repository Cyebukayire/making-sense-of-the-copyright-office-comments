AI is damaging to the creative community. Company executives are trying to replace writers, actors, artists and more with AI, which doesn&rsquo;t even create on its own, just mimics the art around it, essentially plagiarizing the internet from the hard work of actual creators. As the internet is inherently biased because of people with biases, AI&rsquo;s only propagate that bias. They lack the software and regulation to tell harmful content apart from regular content. Therefore, sexism, racism, and homophobia will be perpetuated by AI, which is absolutely unacceptable. It&rsquo;s being used to copy voices in scam calls, and will soon evolve to faces. Although AI has the potential to become useful, it&rsquo;s no more than a plagiarism machine at this point.
