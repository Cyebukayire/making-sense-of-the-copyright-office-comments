As an artist and writer I&#39;ve been appalled to see my hard work and uniqueness harvested by the likes of Open AI for machine learning.  I have two Fine Art degrees which took up years of my life and thousands of dollars so that I could have a career in my chosen field. I can see the rush by big tech firms to normalize AI gen art and writing apps before a legal framework is introduced to limit what they can harvest. It&#39;s a terrible thing to even consider allowing AI generated images to have the same copyright as human authored work.  AI art is like me ordering a pizza and then proclaiming that I&#39;m a chef. I did not create the pizza and the &#39;click-artists&#39; who generate AI images and text are not the author of works the generator provides. <br/>We have one shot at ensuring the creative industries, that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and make a huge difference to lives worldwide, are not shafted further by a handful of tech billionaires and their delusional dream of &#39;progress at any cost&#39;. Giving AI generated works the same copyright protection as human authored works would open a floodgate for chancers, marketers and scammers to rape the work of established artists and call it their own.  The public is already finding it difficult to identify what is real and what is fake online. <br/>Copyright is the last stand, It must be upheld. <br/>It must remain for 100% human created works only. <br/>I&#39;m genuinely terrified about what will happen if AI works are permitted copyright.
