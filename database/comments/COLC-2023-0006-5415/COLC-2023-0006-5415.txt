I don&#39;t believe AI content should be protected by copyright because it specifically infringes upon it to exist in the first place.  Artists of all stripes shouldn&#39;t be sacrificed in the name of corporate penny pinching.  If you want a particular actor in your show, you pay them.  If you want a certain artist&#39;s style for your comic book, you pay that artist.<br/><br/>There shouldn&#39;t be an venue for people to skip around that.  It undervalues art more than it already is.
