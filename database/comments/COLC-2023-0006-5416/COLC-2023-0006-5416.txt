I strongly believe AI generated content should not be copyrighted. Here are my reasons: AI generated content is not genuine human authorship, AI generated content is inherently derivative, and it can be extremely difficult to determine whether or not copyrighted works were included in the training set for AI generated content, providing a loophole for others to use copyrighted works without permission. I firmly believe that granting copyright to AI generated content undermines the copyright system as a whole and jeopardizes the ability of others to protect their intellectual property.
