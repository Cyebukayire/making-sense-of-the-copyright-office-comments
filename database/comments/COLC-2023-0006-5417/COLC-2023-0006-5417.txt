Generative AI for creative endeavours such as art, music, and writing are based on theft. Their databases are sourced from mass amounts of other artists&#39; work without any permission asked from the original artists.<br/><br/>Generative AI also allows fake artists to monetize work that they have not worked for to gain a result, overshadowing authentic artists and painters, digital or not.<br/><br/>Generative AI violates copyright law by nature of the technology itself. Allowing Generative AI to hold copyright would infringe upon the foundations of copyright law itself.<br/><br/>Please make the right decision.
