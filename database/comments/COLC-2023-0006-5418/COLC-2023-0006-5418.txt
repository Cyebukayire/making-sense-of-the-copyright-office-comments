I am a citizen in the state of California, though I prefer to remain anonymous. <br/><br/>AI has already run rampant with theft of intellectual property and affected the livelihoods of people as companies take advantage of the lack of regulation. WGA and SAG-AFTRA are on strike right now and have stated that they were asked to sign over their voices/likenesses with no paid recompense so studios can continue to use them via AI technology unregulated and unchallenged. This lack of regulation strangles real, thoughtful art from people and has been discouraging future writers, artists, actors, musicians and so on from even considering pursuing their passions. Artists have had to flee from social media to social media as the administrators of those sites also move to steal their work to train an AI system. AI art is not human-created, companies will lie and say that they use it only as a &quot;base&quot; while they have workers touch it up, but this is only a ruse to work around the premise that only human-created work can be copyrighted and those who did the touch-ups will not be paid. This is greed and hubris made blatant with disrespect to art. Please move forward with regulating AI and do not allow companies to take advantage of and drive out human artists.
