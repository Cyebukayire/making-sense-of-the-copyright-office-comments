AI takes without any regard to its sources, with reckless abandon it consumes and consumes. I don&#39;t blame the learning algorithms, but I do blame the people who made these models that so shamelessly (and now consistently) eat away at the livelihood of the artists who still have the integrity to avoid using AI to draw, write, make films. I do not dislike AI, I dislike how its currently being used. It is eating away a the livelihood my artist friends and myself make. It is a soulless excuse for skipping the joy of learning how to be creative. It needs to be strictly regulated and artists compensated for the use of their work.
