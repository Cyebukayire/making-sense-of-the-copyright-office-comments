While context to the type of &quot;AI&quot; being referenced is important,  I will assume the subject is upon generative models. <br/>These models are built upon gargantuan databases of stolen copyrighted work. The trained model is then used to generate content to which competes with that of the original dataset and allowing for this generated content to be copyrighted would be directly supporting theft and unfair exploitation of the already copyrighted material and those who worked to create them.<br/><br/>I would additionally like to state that there is no comparison between the process of human learning and the training of these models. They are made with unmatchable accuracy by training off of the mathematical patterns found in their datasets, even allowing the capability of perfectly reproducing/copying any content from within it.<br/><br/>Allowing generative material to be copyrighted would be to allow the destruction of the livelihoods of those who work in the creative industry though the use of their own work.
