As a citizen who is seeking employment while observing generative AI in relation to the WGA/SAG-AFTRA strikes; I am deeply concerned about the technology&#39;s reach and urge the White House to use every avenue of authority to intervene. Regardless of any potential long-term impact AI models might have on our society, the practice and usage of AI-generated content must be subject to regulatory oversight before it&#39;s too late.
