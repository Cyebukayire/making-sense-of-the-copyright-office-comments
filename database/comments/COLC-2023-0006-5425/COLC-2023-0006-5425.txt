Copyrights for AI generated art (in any form) should not be given at all.  These computer programs are based on theft at a global level individuals actually skilled in creating what the &quot;AI&quot; is searching for.  And those that wish to create wealth through these machines should not have a leg to stand on, as no actual work or labor is performed by the user, it is only done by the machine itself which is more like a glorified slot machine.<br/><br/>If the exact same prompts are used in 2, or more, different Generative AI systems, then the results will be different.  How is the user creating anything?  How are they developing intellectual properties through this if they are being reliant on a class of systems that will read &quot;Dog&quot; and &quot;Flower&quot; as prompts, where the results could be a crude &quot;drawing&quot; of a dog in a flower bed, one next to a flower, or end up being some eldritch abomination of a dog with petals around its neck and stamens coming from its nose?<br/><br/>What is more is that if, for above example, there are no photos, drawings, paintings, or written descriptions of dogs and/or flowers, then the &quot;AI&quot; cannot pump out what the prompts are dictating because there would be no data that it had scraped off the web.  It cannot &quot;create&quot;, it cannot &quot;think&quot;, there is no &quot;intention&quot; in its &quot;creative&quot; process.  It copies and deconstructs pieces that are relevant to the prompts, then reshuffles them all in order to put out pieces that the user is hopefully happy with.  <br/><br/>The datasets that have been created for these programs also contain a staggering amount of data that is copyrighted, not to mention also having data that is personal, private, medical, or any other adjectives that would dictate it to be illegal to have if one is not the lawfully recognized owner.  And yet any works generated by these machines are being freely given out/taken, or being used to generate wealth without proper compensation for any who own the data that was used to generate the works.  The fact that this is not truly being addressed is frightening.  <br/><br/>If the animated &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; from Disney was in one of these datasets, and somehow someone could generate a full movie that was exactly like it but with small variations like changed colors and/or slightly different dialogs, then Disney could not demand reparations if ignoring the copyrighted data in the datasets was still the norm like it is for all the smaller individuals whose data have been leeched by the creators of these machines.<br/><br/>
