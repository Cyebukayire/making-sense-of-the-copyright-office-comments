Generative AI relies entirely on data scrapped from the internet for its massive amounts of training data. This training data consists almost entirely of the hard work of artists, writers, actors, and other creators who did not consent to their copyrighted works being used in generative AI projects. Because of the mass IP theft involved in the creation of AI, content generated by AI should never be granted copyright. Granting copyright to AI generated content that has exploited the intellectual property of human creators will go against everything copyright is supposed to stand for, which is protecting the works of artists, writers, and other creatives from being stolen and exploited without their consent.
