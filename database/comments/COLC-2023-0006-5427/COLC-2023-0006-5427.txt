As a graduate student of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and also a hobbyist who practices digital art, I truly fear for the repercussions that unregulated AI will cause to the creative industry and its people, as well as fellow hobbyists who share their art (visual or written) to the Internet. These repercussions are threats to not only copyright, but also to the livelihoods of these people.
