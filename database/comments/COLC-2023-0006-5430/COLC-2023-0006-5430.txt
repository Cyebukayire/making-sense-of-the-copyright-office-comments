Works created with AI should not be allowed to be copyrighted. Copyright has always been given to human created works- not animal, not robots. Humans. Just because this is new technology doesn&#39;t mean it changes the optics- a machine is making these things by sourcing already copyrighted material from hundreds of thousands of other copyright holders to create something &#39;new&#39;, but it isn&#39;t new. It&#39;s regurgitated, already copyrighted, material. This absolutely should not be tolerated, as it infringes the rights of everyone who had their source items used without their permission. People utilize the copyright service to protect their work from just this type of thing. If copyright no longer protects them, then they have no reason to copyright anything. Accordingly, US law should require ALL AI sourced material list that it is AI sourced, so people can understand that using it could get them in trouble for utilizing previous copyrighted material. It&#39;s not fair for these AI companies to put all the risk onto innocent consumers, at this point, which is what they are doing. They assume none of the risk or liability, but are raking in all the profits and interest for being the &#39;shiny new thing&#39;. The US Copyright Office can be at the forefront of the tide by letting their current copyright holders know that their licenses WILL be protected, as they were promised when they registered their copyright.
