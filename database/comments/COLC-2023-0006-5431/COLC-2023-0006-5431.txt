Artificial Intelligence infringes on the privacy, creative rights and livelihood of individuals. Many AI systems use works of individuals online without their knowing consent, exploiting that individuals own labor. AI should have restricted usage and only trained by experts in the field. The current forms of AI such as ChatGTP abuse the free labor of those online and will further harm those who earn a living in creative fields. AI generated art and voices could also be abused to create fake stories around real-life individuals. For the safety and livihood of individuals, please restrict AI and not allow it to be copyrighted. Without monetary incentive, many will be discouraged from using the currently exploiting nature of AI.
