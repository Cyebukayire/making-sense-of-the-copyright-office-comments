AI system outputs should not be subject to the copyright data they were trained on in the same way that a human artist creating new artworks is not subject to the copyright data they looked at when learning to draw.<br/><br/>The outputs of AI data should be viewed with the same scrutiny and care as we look at any work created by a person, because a person used a complex tool to ultimately create the work. <br/><br/>There is as much care and attention put into pressing the button on a camera to take a picture and get an output with all it&#39;s billions of pixels of information as there is when a person makes a request to an AI. The technology is no more or less amazing, and the effort is no more or less important.<br/><br/>The value that AI content generation can bring to many fields is much more valuable to society as a whole than the transfer of business from individual creators to other creators with a different skillset.
