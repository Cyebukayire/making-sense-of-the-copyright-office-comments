The purpose of copyright is to protect artists so they can more easily make money off of creative works and there by continue creating. <br/>Ai does not benefit artists and even discourages this creation. If ai were given the same copyright protections as real art it would destroy the cultural development of our society. <br/>There is also the issue of it being made off stolen works. <br/>Works that make even minor use of generative ai should be barred from receiving any protection at all. Allowing it to propagate even a little will degrade the worth of our culture.
