I don&rsquo;t like that Google has let AI into my documents. I have a book I&rsquo;m writing and how do you know it won&rsquo;t spit out an exact copy of my book and stick someone&rsquo;s name on it? It&rsquo;s already happened to several authors and it&rsquo;s a shame! Writing takes hard work and determination not just the ability to make words sound nice when put together.
