AI can be helpful but can&#39;t replace humans. What Disney, Netflix, and other studios of the AMPTP are trying to do is criminal. There&#39;s a difference between using AI to help out and then just replacing your writers with a machine so you don&#39;t have to pay them. Using digital copies of actors is also inhuman. Actors &amp; writers put their heart &amp; soul into what they do, making characters and stories believable and alive. AI is too structured, rigged, lifeless, soulless. Most AI Generators like ChatGPT have guidelines that make it impossible to write a coherent story and keep screwing up information. When you try to write a fight scene like something in Game of Thrones, it either waters it down or refuses too. Try to write a disturbing scene such as the Red Wedding, it&#39;ll say something like &quot;you have to approach this respectfully&quot; even though the whole point is to be disturbing and shocking. AI needs to be reined in as it will kill jobs such teaching and coding. Using digital copies without consent is basically theft, you&#39;re stealing their likeness whether they agreed to it or not for profit. AI can be helpful. It can be used for search engines, quick ideas, and many other purposes. It&#39;s just it must be regulated so it doesn&#39;t take over every aspect of life or exploited for profit like what the AMPTP are doing.
