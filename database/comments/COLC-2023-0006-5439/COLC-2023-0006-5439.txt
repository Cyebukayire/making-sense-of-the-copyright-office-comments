Artificial intelligence as it is being trained and used now is a problem. AI imaging algorithms are being trained on works produced by individuals, who hold the copyright on those works, with the express intent of copying and imitating them without their consent. Wrtiting archive sites are being scraped for writing training data, image hosting sites are being scraped for art, and all of this without the permission and to the detriment of creative people globally. I am a writer and artist, and the knowledge that if I publish my work online it is likely to be stolen is devastating. It&#39;s likely already happened. <br/><br/>On the matter of copyrighting AI generated writing and art, I do not think there is sufficient human input for the prompter to hold copyright. They are not doing the work. When you write something on a typewriter, the human is still doing the work. The typewriter is a tool. An AI image generator is just that- a generator. It is generating the art, and is not a person, and so does not get copyright either.
