Because AI Chatbots are relatively new, most people (including authors) clearly misunderstand how the chatbots work. Currently, only 18% of Americans have even used them. AI Chatbots do not scrape and repackage someone&#39;s work. Instead, what they do is the quintessential example of using material in transformative ways. In fact, AI Chatbots work much the way authors do, who read widely for inspiration and to train themselves to become better writers. Fiction authors, in particular, do not cite every source they&#39;ve ever looked at in their search for inspiration and training. We may hear a few well-known authors tell who inspired them. But most authors can&#39;t even remember all the works they&#39;ve perused. As a retired university writing instructor, an author of eight books, and a writing coach, I&#39;ve tested five AI Chatbots in the past 10 months. I do not believe they are stealing anyone&rsquo;s works or copying anyone&rsquo;s expression of ideas. I do believe some authors may be using lawsuits to get their name in the news and/or to dig into deep pockets.
