Hello, I am writing my support for the US Copyright Office&#39;s ruling that AI art and writing are not protected under copyright, due to AI not being considered to be a human author. While one could argue that with the way AI art and writing is produced, it could fall under fair use, however, I feel like the Fair Use also only protects items authored by humans and not animals or machines.
