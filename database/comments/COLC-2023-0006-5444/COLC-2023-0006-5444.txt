I believe that AI should only be trained on works that it has permission to use. That means no training models with copyrighted works without artists&#39; or writers&#39; consent. To have your work reproduced by AI without consent or copyright permission is demoralizing and dehumanizing for the artist, and can be easily used to misrepresent the artist&#39;s beliefs or even impersonate someone.
