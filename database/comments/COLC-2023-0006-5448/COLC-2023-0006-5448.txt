To the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office: I am an artist of 32 years of age. You have never met me. You don&#39;t know my name... but that doesn&#39;t matter much. Cause this is not about *just* me.<br/><br/>For the past year, AI firms have sold a product to consumers that competes in the marketplace with artists, using their own works for it to even function as intended. These programs have to recreate the image they are trained on almost 1 to 1, essentially creating an inferior forgery, to then compress to smaller sizes to store in their data points for later use during image generation.<br/><br/>This has been done to millions of artists, people, and creatives in general, all at our expense, while they lie -bald-faced- about their intentions. They call it a boon to artists while proverbially stripping skin off our backs to make an amalgam to wow the masses. They lie about the program&#39;s actual capabilities to make it marketable. And demonize the artists who rightfully are angry about how they&#39;re being exploited en masse, and want to sell to companies to eliminate us from the market.<br/><br/>This is not like the coming of the camera/photography, or Photoshop or similar programs with the advent of the computer, or any other similar thing before AI. None of them required the wholesale theft, illegal copying, and laundering of millions of people&#39;s data, without compensation or consent. All of them still required the learned skills of the spaces they revolutionized to properly use or make the best of.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office said that human participation or involvement is a bedrock requirement of copyright. That statement must remain true. These not at all intelligent AI, the things they generate were not once touched by a human hand, made from the torn shreds of works that were. Allowing these firms and companies to have these AI generators be copyrightable would destroy artists as a community, and truly lead to -with no exaggeration- a dystopian landscape for them, with no recovery. It would allow companies to essentially say that the many works of artists are basically worth nothing, because they can have a machine do it.<br/><br/>This is why it would destroy livelihoods and careers to allow such a thing. You must not allow this. The AI firms must not win if artistic culture is to survive.<br/>
