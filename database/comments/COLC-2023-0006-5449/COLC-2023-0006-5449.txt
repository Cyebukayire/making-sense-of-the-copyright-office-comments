The fact that AI can&#39;t create anything without human works being put in. The AI cannot create anything truly original. Allowing it to be copyrighted opens the door to so much more, and already, artists in multiple medias are being put out of work. This isn&#39;t a question in a vacuum, these things aren&#39;t creating anything new, and people are paying for it with their livelihoods. If this isn&#39;t regulated, more and more people will be out of work.
