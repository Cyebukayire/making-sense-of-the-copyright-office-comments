&quot;Generative AI&quot; is created from mass scraping of existing artworks and creations without permission or proper compensation to the original creators and laborers. This is problematic when what is generated with this application is done so with the intent of gaining profit. I write this comment because I believe that we should respect and protect artists as both creators and laborers.<br/><br/>With regard to the United States, the majority of people I know who work are living paycheck to paycheck. The creative industries are no exception and I don&#39;t know a single writer, musician, or visual artist who is able to afford living expenses on their creative trade alone. We do not have robust social safety nets for the struggling worker. So to me, the risks of allowing authorship to something only possible through exploitative theft is unacceptable.<br/>I end with an analogy: When an instructor gives their students a prompt, do we give that teacher authorship of the resulting essays based on that prompt?
