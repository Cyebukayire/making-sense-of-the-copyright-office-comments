The use of copyrighted materials to train AI systems should qualify as fair use and thus not constitute copyright infringement. Fair use is determined by analyzing four statutory factors in light of copyright&#39;s purpose to promote innovation.<br/><br/>The purpose and character of using copyrighted data to train AI is highly transformative. Training does not seek to exploit the expressive value of the underlying works. Rather, small excerpts are analyzed to spot patterns and make statistical inferences about language. This use is unrelated to the creative aspects of the works.<br/><br/>The nature of the copyrighted works favors fair use. AI training data consists of factual information and functional textual passages, not creative expression. Copyright law affords less protection to such functional material.<br/><br/>The amount of the copyrighted work used for training is reasonable in light of the purpose. Only small excerpts are ingested to make inferences. AI systems do not reproduce substantial portions or wholesale copies of works.<br/><br/>Finally, training AI provides significant public benefits in enabling technological advances. It does not usurp the market for the underlying works or deprive copyright owners of commercial gains. The transformative technical use of limited excerpts poses little risk to protected incentives.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the public interest in spurring AI innovation outweighs minimal impacts on copyright owners. Fair use principles should shield the use of copyrighted material to train AI systems from infringement liability.
