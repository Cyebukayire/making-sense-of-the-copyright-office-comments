AI generated pieces (be they visual art, writing, audio, or other) cannot be counted under copyright because they were synthesized by a machine program rather than created by a human. While we refer to these bots as &quot;AI,&quot; they are not so advanced as to have their own consciousness; they are advanced computer programs that can do no more than their programming allows. Furthermore, AI generated pieces are created by the program stealing other artists&#39; creations from the internet and synthesizing them together to make something new. These artists (a term used broadly here) are not asked permission to have their work used for this synthesis. AI programs are also not restricted to stealing work that is not protected by copyright; any work that is available to the program can be stolen for &quot;training&quot; purposes. This takes AI programs past plagiarism, and should be considered breaches of copyright law.
