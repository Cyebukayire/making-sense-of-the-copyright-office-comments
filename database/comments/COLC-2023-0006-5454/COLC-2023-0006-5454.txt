1. As described above, generative AI systems have the ability to produce material that would be copyrightable if it were created by a human author. What are your views on the potential benefits and risks of this technology? How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, technology developers, researchers, and the public? <br/>My first concern is protecting jobs in the illustration and copy writing industries. Free use of ai works would severly decrease the availability of paid opportunities for artists and writers.<br/>Further, due to the unavoidable element of human error or bias introduced while training, labeling and collecting data for the model, AI creates a false sense of authority to users while reiterating untrue or biased ideas.<br/><br/>28. Should the law require AI-generated material to be labeled or otherwise publicly identified as being generated by AI? If so, in what context should the requirement apply and how should it work? <br/>Yes, especially for wrotten works. At minimum, an article or post generated using AI should have a disclaimer in the manner of ad or sponsored content notices for advertisements in the style of articles.<br/><br/>28.1. Who should be responsible for identifying a work as AI-generated?<br/>The poster of an ai article or post should be responsible for including a disclaimer.
