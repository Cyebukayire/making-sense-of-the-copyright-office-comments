AI content created by a human author should not be copyrightable especially when said content includes work done by another human creator.  Artists, writers, and other content creators have struggled with theft for as long as we can remember, and it has only gotten worse within social media such as Facebook, Twitter (X), and Instagram.  Content has been reposted by other people without the creator&#39;s consent, and at times the creator is not given their proper credit.  This has led to more recognition and &quot;likes&quot; to the reposter than the original artist.  This has been a problem in itself that artist&#39;s like me and other content creator&#39;s alike still struggle to fight against.  To add copyright to AI images, which have been known to include content from artists without their consent or knowledge, will only add more to the already constant struggle of stopping our art from getting stolen.  No ownership should go to an author who has used content that is not theirs to begin with.
