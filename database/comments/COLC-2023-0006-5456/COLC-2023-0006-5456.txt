People who create content should now have their work unfairly stolen so that large institutions don&#39;t have to pay their workers a fair wage. As children theft of writing is plagiarism, the same is said for an actors&#39; face, a singers&#39; voice, an artists&#39; work. You cannot make those who choose to create cannon fodder in your search to save yourself money. It is immoral, impractical, and disgusting.
