Training AI on a person&#39;s art without their express consent, and by this I mean directly given consent, not consent obtained by failure to &quot;opt-out&quot; or by simple use of a platform entertaining millions, is theft and exploitation. The fact that AI techbology is being used to steal from artists is a scam at best and an incredible squandering of the potential of the technology.
