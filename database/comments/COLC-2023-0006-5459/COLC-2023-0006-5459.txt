Generative AI represents a huge challenge to creators. We raise concerns about potential copyright infringement, as these AI systems generate content that resembles original work. This can undermine everyone&#39;s rights, dilute our artistic voices, and create competition in the same market. This exploitation of AI technology has the potential to displace numerous individuals from their livelihoods and in some cases already has.<br/><br/>There is an argument to be made that giving copyright to such works will send a troubling message. It could imply that in America, where protective measures against exploitation are supposed to exist, we are prioritizing technology that is built upon a foundation of theft and exploitation. In light of these concerns and the implications for creators and the artistic community, AI works must not be granted copyright protection.
