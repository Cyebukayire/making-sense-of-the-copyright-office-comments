AI does not work without theft, and it introduces extreme risk to not only creators, but everyday citizens who might end up having their likeness commercialized as a product without their consent, as AI does not and has not been shown to be capable of differentiating between private and public, real and not real.

Every level of our society needs to summarily reject handing over IP as a trade-in for mediocre, cheap, stolen AI-produced works.
