I do not believe that any work created with/by AI, whether with or without any human authorship/guidance whatsoever, should be allowed to be copyrighted. <br/><br/>The programs that were built to shamelessly scrape and scour both text and visual arts across the internet for use in their systems are at the very least unethical by principle and at the most extremely illegal via their theft and use of artwork that does not, in any way, belong to anyone save the sole creator of that original work, regardless of whether or not it&#39;s being shoved through an AI program. <br/><br/>AI programs were created by people who did not want to put in the effort to learn how to produce artwork themselves, and if they are allowed to continue their theft, destruction, and &#39;recreating,&#39; then not only will legitimate artists suffer loss of livelihood, but the AI constructs will become more and more homogenized until one piece is indistinguishable from any other, simply because they&#39;re all stealing from the same sources over and over again. <br/><br/>The idea that someone could plug a set of Stephen King novels, for example, into an AI program, give it a set of parameters to meet, and then claim that the resulting creation is &#39;theirs&#39; is absolutely absurd. Of course it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a butchered, stitched-together set of words, all of which were stolen from an actual author, who put talent, craft, and skill into creating them in the first place.
