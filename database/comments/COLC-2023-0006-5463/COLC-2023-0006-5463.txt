I work as a contractor in AI. <br/>AI, now, is not very good at words. It has the textual equivalent of too many fingers and weird teeth, in addition to making stuff up. But just like the fingers thing got fixed, sooner or later AI&#39;s text will be better.<br/>The fact it makes stuff up is a more complex problem. That probably won&#39;t get fixed for far longer. <br/>Allowing copyright on the work of AI will be a contributing factor to AI&#39;s power of misinformation, both in art and in text, for two reasons. <br/>Firstly, it is harder to explain &quot;no, look, here this strange eyelid crease shows this image isn&#39;t real&quot; or &quot;look you can tell this is AI because it repeats itself 4 pages later&quot; if you cannot show the work in question. <br/>Secondly, allowing copyright on AI works will make this misinformation profitable. There are now, already, AI-written books about edible wild plants. These books may kill someone. <br/><br/>I am sure you are getting many comments about art. I am submitting a comment about alleged facts. Minimally, please, require that an AI work that is purporting to be something factual -- a history book, a health guide, a crime scene photo -- cannot make itself profitable and difficult to criticize by calling on the power of copyright.
