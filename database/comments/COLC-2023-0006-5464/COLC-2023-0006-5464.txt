Text generated by AI, such as ChatGPT, inherently infringes on others&#39; copyright and possession of work. It copies and tries to learn from real writers to produce work that is similar to what it copies or learns from. Sometimes it&#39;s not even that different. If AI was allowed to copyright its own work there are future problems. What if someone applies for a copyright on copied work produced by their AI, before an author that they copied is able to apply for a copyright? It would be stealing from thag writer before they even begin trying to profit off of it. AI rarely produces anything original, and instead can only produce things that are a product of theft. Writers can&#39;t currently opt in or out of their work being used to train AI. AI should be prohibited from applying for a copyright until it can produce works that are distinctly different than the works used in its training. Those works should also be freely given, either by the author or by public domain,  to train the AI. Until there are protective measures in place to stop it from stealing the voice of authors, it should be unable to have any protections on the works it produces.<br/><br/>I did specifically use writers in this comment. Writers should easily be interchanged for artists of any medium. Text, sculpture, graphic design, etc. all suffer when AI is able to freely steal the ideas of these artists.
