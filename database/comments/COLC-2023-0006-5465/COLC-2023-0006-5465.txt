Algorithmic generated content, commonly referred to as &quot;AI&quot; writing or art should not be copy writable. Rather than produce a unique, original product, these programs use an algorithm to take users prompts to calculate a likely mixture of already created, and usually used without permission or compensation to the original creators, work to reflect the user&#39;s input. Much like a math algorithm, as the user becomes more precise, the algorithm becomes more sophisticated at mixing works from its datasets. However, unlike a true artist or person, it does not analyze, synthesize, or cogitate at all about the nature of its output. It cannot do anything without a prompt, as opposed to a human writer or artist that can generate original content under their own initiative.<br/><br/>To summarize.<br/>Algorithms, commonly referred to as &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; or &quot;AI&quot; calculate a likely output of words or images based on a user prompt. It does this based on already extent work that is often stolen. It does not create anything without a prompt.<br/><br/>Therefore it should be ineligible for protections granted to copyrighted works.
