It is morally abhorrent that producers of Generative AI have used swathes of online content to train their models, content that absolutely contains the work of individuals who have not consented, or cannot consent, to its use. These companies make no effort to obtain permission, they make no effort to review the material used. They cannot account for what has been consumed. We are all fodder to them. Their goal, I can only assume, is to make obsolete the creativity of so many different careers. Why hire an artist if they can generate art from millions upon millions of uploads. Why pay writers if novels have been analyzed by the thousands. Why hire background actors if you&#39;re pressed to have your likeness scanned for work. What is the point of all of this? Why are we allowing these companies to produce tools upon the backs of so very many people who have had their labor stolen? Piracy has allegedly further informed their models as well, as many authors have asserted in recent lawsuits. We need to regulate generative AI immediately with strict expectations for training. No one&#39;s content and creativity should be stolen so humans can be replaced in the very careers they strive for. This is science fiction made real in the most prophetic sense.
