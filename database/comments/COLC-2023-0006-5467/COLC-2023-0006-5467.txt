Scraping artists works without compensation and using them in an attempt to generate new art for profit is wildly unethical and should be a violation of intellectual property. If companies want to use artists to train their AI machines they should have to pay them for their work. If I can&#39;t use images of Mickey Mouse that have been posted online to sell something on Etsy what right does a corporation have to take what artists have posted online and use it to sell AI Art?
