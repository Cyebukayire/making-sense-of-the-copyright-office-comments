&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is it is referred to in discourse in the year 2023 is neither thing. AI as it currently exists is effectively a content aggregator, rather than a system for generating original works. It functions by taking the creations of others, stripping those works of their unique value, and producing generic works. This erosion of copyright protection is detrimental to creatives, both in terms of producing those original works of art, writing, or the sciences, as well as the financial hardship that effective theft has on the original creator.<br/><br/>This detrimental effect will spread to society as a whole. Content mills like the scripts currently labeled as &quot;AI&quot; will not be used to empower individuals, but to churn out reductive products at price point unsustainable by anyone but large corporations that own the aggregation processes.<br/><br/>In the event that a true artificial intelligence is created, it would be as creative as any human born the old fashioned way and should be accorded the same intellectual rights. The systems marketed as &quot;AI&quot; at this time are instead automated systems for wholesale content theft, and should not be furnished any special positive consideration under the interpretation of US copyright law.
