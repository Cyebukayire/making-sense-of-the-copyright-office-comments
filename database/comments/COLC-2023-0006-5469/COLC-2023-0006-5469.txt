Attempting to construct law in a manner to enable profiteering from is a losing game. It is quite simply impracticable to track ownership and distribute payment. The only relatively tangible costs associated with A.I. is the power used by the computer system that drives any given A.I.<br/><br/>For example: A.I. number one run by Company A uses an artists work to generate an image and the output is fed directly into A.I. number two run by Company B. Who owns the final product? I simply do not see how this could possibly have a fair outcome for anyone.<br/><br/>The current paradigm of copyright is simply not compatible with our technological progress. Technology aims to enable any person to do more things which is severely hampered by treating digital copyright like physical goods. How are new ideas supposed to flourish if a bunch of entities want money from everyone involved? Either we accept digital goods are impractically difficult to control and make A.I. opensource and accessible to all or it turns into yet another steaming pile of gridlock thanks to corporate gatekeeping. This is no happy medium on this.<br/><br/>Do the right thing so I can have SOMETHING to look forward to as the ocean consumes our coastlines a little bit faster every year...<br/><br/>
