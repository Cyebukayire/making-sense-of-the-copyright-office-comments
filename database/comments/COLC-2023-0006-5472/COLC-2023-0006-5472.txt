As it currently stands unregulated AI generative programs pose a serious threat to the livelihood of people in creative fields, the majority of AI content at the moment is built upon the stolen work of artists, writers, and voice actors. There is potential use for the technology involved but unless it is using datasets which are ethically sourced, where the creatives are compensated for their work, and where the companies/ individuals behind the programs are completely transparent about where the information they are using is from, then it will cause undue financial and mental stress upon people in creative fields, who are already often in a precarious state.
