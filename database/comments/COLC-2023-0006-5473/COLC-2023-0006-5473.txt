As an animator and artist, I firmly oppose the use of generative AI for commercial purposes. It is damaging to the integrity and well-being of artists and consumers alike. Those who are stripped of their creative rights are forced to compete with an automated product that is often inferior to those that are manmade. AI is limited to human input; humans are infinitely breaking limits. AI lacks expression, dignity, and adherence to ethics. It derives, steals, and mocks preexisting images to create marginally appealing work. For decades we have been warned of the dangers of AI. Just because we can do something technologically outstanding&hellip;does not mean we should. I&rsquo;m perplexed we haven&rsquo;t learned the lesson already.
