AI-Generated Imagery as a means to cut corners for the industry is a threat to my livelihood and any attempt to replace human artists with AI should be met with contempt. In a time where writers are striking to protect their jobs and to be awarded fair compensation for their work, I find it alarming that companies are responding by using AI to substitute paying said employees without their consent, and as an aspiring artist, I feel the same applies to them as well. I do believe AI can be used as a tool to assist people in the creative process, but should not be a replacement or substitute for human creativity. Lastly, I fear that the amount of misinformation on the internet can be exacerbated with the use of AI and deepfakes. With how dangerous misinformation can affect people&#39;s actions, I feel as if AI should be regulated to prevent the concerns I have expressed, and a huge start would be to prevent AI Imagery from being copyrightable to prevent companies from profiting off the exploitation of creatives.
