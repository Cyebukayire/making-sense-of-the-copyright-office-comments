I am a television writer currently on strike. AI is one of the big issues. It&#39;s terrifying that a bot could be &#39;taught&#39; everything that&#39;s ever happened on the show I write for, instructed to generate a week of scripts, and have one writer (at WGA minimum) come in to humanize them, leaving the rest of us out of work. I heard a podcast where a host interviewed an AI bot and instructed it to answer in different actors voices - Morgan Freeman, Kristin Scott, Arnold Sharzeneigher, Chris Rock. It was able to do it seamlessly and it would be hard to tell the difference. That&#39;s terrifying. And the technology is moving so rapidly - no one was even talking about this a year ago. The studios/CEOs in entertainment would love nothing more than to replace us all with AI because it would save them a ton of money. Meanwhile, our words and likenesses and voices are being used for whatever purpose they designate, and we have nothing to say about it? Not to mention no remuneration? The genie is out of the bottle unfortunately, but AI must be regulated before it replaces not just writers and actors, but anyone in the labor force, just to save the companies money. It&#39;s not right.
