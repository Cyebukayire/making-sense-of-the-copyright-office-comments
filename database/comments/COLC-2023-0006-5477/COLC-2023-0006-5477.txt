Artificial Intelligence should have immunity to all copyright claims. Machines perceive data by the packets in which they receive data. For human biology, this data comes in the form of light reflected in patterns that represent text or audio waves that are processed into music by the brain. This information, or the essence of the information as processed by the brain creates a physical copy called an engram amongst neurons in the brain.<br/><br/>These engrams are not considered a copyright violation, even though they do exist in the brain of every person who has subconsciously created a memory of the content after accessing it. Neural networks work in the same way as human brains, accessing content and processing it before storing the information that represents that content inside of a physical medium, the circuits on a board.<br/><br/>The way that files, like copyrighted books or images work, is that they are fed into a computer and are not stored, but the processed version of the file is stored. The individual words or pixels are not memorized, but instead how they come together to form concepts. The files themselves are not being copied, but processed, much the same way our own brains process and store information.<br/><br/>AI should not be a copyright issue because any machine, biological or silicon, could form the same structures of memory through the observation of different stimuli. Instead, this must be a question of access to information, including copyrighted material. If access to information is purchased legally, then any processing that occurs to that information for the purpose of consumption and processing should be considered acceptable use.<br/><br/>Conversely, anything created from a trained neural network should be considered intellectual property on the part of all conscious participants. This is the tricky part because consciousness is a taboo in the scientific community. We have formulas for determining if something is likely to have consciousness or not, but the current generative AI mediums are just tools, being used by humans to offload advanced cognitions, similar to a calculator. Instead, though, it is a centralization of offloaded format-specific information. That information might be what a blue ball looks like or a paragraph of text. These were still created, though some of the cognitive steps were augmented by a data analytics tool that automatically produced the desired result.<br/><br/>AI should challenge the very foundation of how we evaluate what is intellectual property in the new age of AGI. This topic needs public attention at the highest levels of government because our place as human beings is about to change. Please don&#39;t let this comment form be the only attention the topic deserves.
