I am speaking on the front of AI used in the creative arts and the impact it would have in regards working artists. <br/>There is no intelligence when AI generates art. It is a machine that has to be feed thousands upon thousands of stolen artwork with no credit or compensation for the artists that it takes from. It becomes a cheap, shallow replacement for capitalists to exploit on the labor of actual people to create a bigger wage gap between the working class the ones at the top who never have to fear their skills or livelihoods are reduced to how replaceable they could be. AI generated art cannot be copyright because it did not come from a human and to say a human inputed prompts is equivalent to the time, effort and education an artist worked to produce their works is dehumanizing. Prompts are not materials they are generalized ideas mashed together and even ideas have at this point not been copyrighted.
