AI use SHOULD be subject to copyright for the art and images it is trained on. Many artists like me think the same. AI builders will train their machines on our hard working honest art, copy our style and data, and then companies use it to replace us. AI &quot;art&quot; is THEFT! Do NOT let them get away with being exempt from copyright!
