I think generative AI art and&nbsp; Large Language Models infringes on copyright of artists and writers. The indiscriminate scraping of the art from the Internet without the concent of artists is unethical and should be illegal. All generative art models should use opt in only. <br/>The most blatant example of the maliciousness of generative AI is programs that allow and encourage it&#39;s users to mimic, impersonate or steal other artists art and art styles, even when artists have explicitly requested their art not be used. There are also many examples of these art models making almost exact duplicates of existing art making at best only minor changes to. <br/>The generative AI and Large Language Models should purge their data of any copyrighted works that the artists and writers who have not conscented to their work being used. <br/><br/>This will result in artists, writers and even actors own work being used to replace them. The the current strikes in Hollywood with both actors and writers is a clear example of corporations refusal to not use these models to replace real workers, and will result in a concentration of wealth into corporations while the artist whos work was stolen become unemployed.<br/>
