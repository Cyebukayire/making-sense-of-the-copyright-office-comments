Considering that many AI programs scan copyrighted works for data, then produce content from that data, it seems to be in violation of the copyright holders&#39; rights to derivative work. The technology itself could be patented, but it is unreasonable that that which it produces at the command of a few key words should be copyrightable by the person who entered the prompt. AI generated art and written media should not be protected under copyright.
