My opinion is that artificial intelligence (AI) can be an incredibly useful tool, but it is incapable of creating an original, copyrightable work on it&#39;s own. I think that when attempting to copyright something where the creator has used AI to make it, it must be clear that the core material has been modified from and is not wholly dependent on the portions generated with AI.<br/>I also believe that if an AI is allowed to be used in copyrighted work (again, as a tool and not a sole source) that AI must be trained on material that is either: a) open-sourced or otherwise freely usable or b) able to be copyright claimed by the user of the AI tool. For example: I believe Disney could use an AI tool trained on their movies to create ideas for new scripts (given that these ideas are then expanded on and refined by a real human), but they would not be able to copyright anything created using an AI trained on an independent creator&#39;s works.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t believe these ideas are anything revolutionary. AI can be a powerful tool, but it doesn&#39;t create something new; it mashes an astronomical amount of pre-existing material into something that only looks new.
