I don&#39;t believe anything created with the help of AI should be subject to copyright law in anyway given AI models have trained against human content with no meaningful oversight. AI output is blatant theft of human creativity by capitalists with the means to pay computer scientists to train models. <br/><br/>In fact, I believe the Justice Department&#39;s anti-trust division should be mandated to create a new sub-agency to scrutinize AI companies and their behaviors under monopoly law because AI will&mdash;by nature&mdash;lead to information monopolization.
