Should not be legal to copyright AI generated material, as it is not generated by a person who can be legally protected by copyright, or an entity that can be said to have an intellect with which to create intellectual property, but rather generated by an algorithm. It can&rsquo;t be said to own its output any more than any other programs can be said to own theirs. (Or than anyone can be said to own any automatic functions of any program or app they use.) Prompting can&rsquo;t possibly count as &ldquo;creating&rdquo; any more than someone suggesting an idea to an actual writer, something executives already frequently do. So questions of quality aside, it just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.
