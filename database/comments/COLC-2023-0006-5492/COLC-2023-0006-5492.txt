I firmly believe that any content created by &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; as it currently exists, is incapable of being copyrighted. In its current iteration, artificial intelligence is a misnomer and is instead what is actually called machine learning. It&#39;s no more sophisticated than a complex version of Siri or Alexa, capable of answering questions and fulfilling prompts, but not actually capable of thinking for itself in any creative capacity. Creativity requires humanity; all artificial intelligence can do is regurgitate what&#39;s been fed into it, and because all it can do is regurgitate what already exists, its output can&#39;t be copyrighted. I am a teacher at a university. If one of my students were submit an assignment that was a clear regurgitation of another source, whether that was Wikipedia or somewhere else, with only a few words changed to &quot;make it their own,&quot; I don&#39;t pat them on the back and applaud them for their creativity. I tell them that it&#39;s plagiarism and they need to redo the assignment. It shouldn&#39;t be any different with artificial intelligence. The machine didn&#39;t think for itself, the prompter didn&#39;t need any discipline to use the tool, all it did was spit content back out in an imperceptibly different way than it was fed. That&#39;s not originality, that&#39;s not creativity, that&#39;s not even parody. It&#39;s an insulting mockery of the time and effort that human creators put into the work that they produce.
