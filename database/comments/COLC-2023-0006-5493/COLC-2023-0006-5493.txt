I do not believe any kind of art, (screenplays, novels, music, painting, etc) should be allowed to be covered by copyright laws, if all, or a good deal of it was created using A.I.  If it&#39;s hard to determine that threshold, I would rather the Copyright Office &#39;err on the side of&#39; excluding ANY A.I. created content.  I am a musician, songwriter, composer, screenwriter, novelist, filmmaker, graphic designer, actor and photographer.
