Developers of generative AI like Midjourney took artists&#39; works that were uploaded on the internet without permission. People are using voice actors&#39; voices to make AI generated songs without the permission of the actors themselves. Unregulated use of AI is currently allowing to use people&#39;s art or likeness without their consent and it&#39;s damaging and disrespectful. Art, photos,videos,animation, music, etc that were AI generated should not hold any copyright because all it does is steal people&#39;s art, likeness, and voices. It doesnt generate something new. It also only benefits businesses / corporations and not actual people. It doesnt solve any global problem. Why cant developers just use their intelligence to make something that can solve any of the UN Sustainable goals. Nobody asked for this.
