I do not believe that AI created content should be eligible for copyright protections. The purpose of copyright is to protect the creations of someone that worked in order to make. Tasking an AI to make something does not take the same kind of dedication, and should not be treated as such. Also, the current copyright clarifies that it&#39;s exclusively for human works, and it&#39;s already been determined that art created by animals is ineligible for copyrights.
