As someone studying professional game development, I have observed the application of AI generated assets in game development and believe the following to be major copyright and/or ethical concerns:<br/><br/>1. Unpermitted use of a third party&#39;s works or assets to train an AI model, with &quot;works or assets&quot; including 2D illustrations (animated or otherwise), 2D sprite-sheets, 3D models, textures/texture sheets, audio, code, written works, etc., even if licensed to use or remix said original works (i.e. creative commons).<br/>2. Generation of assets using already-existing AI models that were trained on unpermitted work (even if the AI model was trained before laws were formed).<br/>3. Attempts to copyright assets generated by *any* AI model regardless of asset type or application, *unless* given permission/licensing by both the creator of the AI model and everyone who contributed works to train said AI model.<br/>4. Use of assets generated by *any* AI model except where due attribution to the AI model is made.<br/><br/>Consequently, I believe the following may warrant legal action against an offending party:<br/><br/>1. An individual or entity finding that their work has been used to train a new AI model without direct permission, and/or said AI model has been used to generate assets, even if their work is under an existing creative commons license.<br/>2. An individual or entity finding that an offending party is continuing to use an already-existing AI model that breaches new copyright laws once said laws are made.<br/>3. An individual or entity that owns or contributed to an AI model finding that an asset generated by said AI model has been copyrighted *without* both the permission of the AI model&#39;s owner *and* the permission of everyone who contributed works to the AI model, or without licensing.<br/>4. An individual or entity that owns or contributed to an AI model finding that an asset generated by said AI model has been used without due attribution.<br/><br/>Without these laws, the real people that create assets and works in game development could be out of a job. Jobs such as 2D illustrators, 2D animators, 3D modellers, 3D texturers, technical artists, promotional artists, sound designers, music composers/arrangers, programmers, game designers, writers, etc. I also believe that AI models could harm the creative expression of said individuals even when not working for profit, especially if their work or style is being recreated using AI without their permission.
