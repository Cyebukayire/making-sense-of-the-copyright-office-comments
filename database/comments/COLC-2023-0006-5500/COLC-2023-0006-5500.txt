While the burgeoning of this technology is a boon in many areas of creative exploration, the ethical concerns over how easily it is currently being abused draws the line for myself and hundreds of thousands of other creatives, be them hobbyists or professionals working in the entertainment industry. With the already unconsentual scraping of millions upon millions of works and data from individuals, the thought that someone can freely benefit and lay claim to that data as a new work of their own for profit, with the potential to then turn around and sue or slander the original artists that provided the data they&#39;re using for their own ends, is a deplorable thought if left unchecked. The rights and protections of original human artists, authors, musicians, and more, should be upheld and considered well before any kind of ai generated model. It would be catastrophic for the industry at large to encourage any forms of competition- instead bolstering stagnation and exploitation.<br/><br/>If AI generative models are allowed to have their results copywritten, it needs to be heavily considered on a case by case basis: what model is in use, how it is being used, and whether or not the individuals whos works comprise the datasets involved, fully consented to their usage. Much in the same way an individual artist consents to and licenses their work for commercial reproduction. Without that consensual agreement, it is no better than bootlegged merchandise or appropriation of artist&#39;s own identity.
