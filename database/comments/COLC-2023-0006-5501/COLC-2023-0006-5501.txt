Hello! My new is w247, and I&#39;m a hobby artist and game and media enthusiast and have been for over my whole life. The rise of Artificial Intelligence has created strange amagimations and bastardizations of real human work made from the blood, sweat and tears that took time and effort. You may have heard through several grape vines of AI databases stealing from artists such as popular ones to make certain memes like &quot;Walter white on a trail cam&quot; or &quot;zenomorph goes to court&quot; and while these ideas are fun in practice, they take away the value of human work, and we can say the same for music and voice acting as well as it&#39;s stolen to make covers such as Billy Joel&#39;s piano Man or much more niche songs. These practices also steal work from artists as well, stealing living wages from them in order to live. There&#39;s even some cases where they steal work from people&#39;s writing with writing editors through online services. AI has become  a much more mainstream things but it also has become more unstable in my opinion, being more environmental unfriendly and a detrimental tool to people around it.<br/>ChatGPT used to be a great tool back in day(granted I never used it) but now it&#39;s spiraling out of control due to unregulated and unchecked regulations.<br/>When I was younger, I heard that &quot;AI and robots would take over the world&quot; but I never expected them to take over like this, stealing uniquely human jobs like art and literature instead of helping with hard tasks that even humans have a hard time to handle like manufacturing.
