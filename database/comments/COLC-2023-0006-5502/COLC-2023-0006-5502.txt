Despite the massive attempt by artists to lie about the technology to further their self interests its abundantly clear that the generative technology in question in its current form is sufficiently creative and transformative enough that to attempt to call it infringing upon anyone&#39;s copyrights or intellectual property.  <br/>  <br/>On the question of it is worthy of copyright itself one need only look at the field of photography in which, like generative content, involves a fair bit of human input prior but ultimately comes down to a press of a button and a machine producing the desired product. If this qualifies for copyright it cannot be questioned that generative content does as well.  <br/>  <br/>Many attempt to make sympathetic pleas to bury this technology before it hurts their own wallets but the reality is that if the line that must not be crossed when it takes jobs away from humans then we crossed that line many decades ago. There is no reason that the jobs of artists should receive anymore protection than the job of a factory worker.
