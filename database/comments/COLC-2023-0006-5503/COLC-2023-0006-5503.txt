While it is true that the typewriter is only a tool in the creation of a manuscript and therefore the credit belongs to the typewriter&#39;s operator. In the case of AI, the tool is the AI and the operator is the program itself. We do not grant copywriter to the constructor of the typewriter. In third case we are talking about content creation AIs used in creative work. The models are often trained on content found online. While the content generated could be considered derivative enough to be free from copyright, it&#39;s not fair that the content being used to train AI is not an equal participant in this process as the creators of the program.
