Artificial Intelligence is only as smart as it programmed to be. We will always have the upper hand and the integration of this ecosystem will only improve the quality of life for all it reaches. The implementation of AI AI is all of its varieties give humanity the upper hand..we need to create an eco system that supports the vast possibilities this burgeoning technology has to offer. I feel as an educated and informed individual this is will profoundly increase the vast amount of information already available..in the hugely unregulated and insecure world wide web..AI could ultimately allow for a better, secure and more useful experience with the internet of things.
