I think AI should be viewed as a tool like Photoshop. Even if generative AI can produce a large work, at the end it is a tool the user is using. On top of this, unless there is a watermark, it is impossible to actually tell if a work came from AI or to what degree. This making a sticky situation where people will have to prove a negative (they aren&#39;t using AI) which is impossible unless if they record themselves throughout the process. <br/><br/>I think like a tool like Photoshop, the copyright should be for the user and not the company. For example, if I asked ChatGPT to write me a short story, and this is what it should be about. I should own the copyright and not OpenAI. <br/><br/>I think viewing AI as a tool vs making whatever it makes public domain, current laws and regulations can be used. For example, if say AI generated a 1 to 1 work of a human&#39;s or a human generated a 1 to 1 work of an AI without actually trying. Marking it as public domain makes it where the original artist can&#39;t do anything since the AI&#39;s work is in the public domain. Imagine this example being used in music, movies, etc. Where if it was treated as a tool, then first come first serve like any other copyright.
