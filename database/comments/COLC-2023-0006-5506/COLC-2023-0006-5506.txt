I&#39;ve thought that copyright&#39;s duration and reach should drastically be reduced as it is for years, so to see people rallying around the idea of expanding it around this issue terrifies me, so I may as well put in my two cents.<br/><br/>To be blunt, you should handle this with an extremely light touch, because most ways that copyright could be used would end up disastrously. Shrinking fair use could easily be used against independent creators for whom the DMCA is already a constant hassle, laws forcing a purge of models trained on copyrighted data would definitely be used to attack archivists akin to the current unfair and horrible lawsuits against the Internet Archive, and expanding copyright to style would be the absolute worst idea, because it would give corporate entities deep pockets carte blanche to attack artists who work with collage; mashup or pastiche.<br/><br/>An example of how these could be deleterious to art can be found in the history of sampling, where legal limitation of it under copyright law massively devastated the technique; putting it out of reach of most independent small creators; and corporate entities ended up taking any economic value given to original artists, as expansions of copyright law always do.<br/><br/>Any decrease of fair use weakens a tool of artistic protection that is already supremely underpowered due to the fact that the legal fees involved in any &quot;grey areas&quot; inherently advantage large firms, and this would be no different, doubly so when one considers the massive stockpiles of copyrighted material these gargantuan firms have to train their own LMMs on that could be made inaccessible by independent artists and used to displace artists even more easily than the current state of AI models. The only thing that would change in expanding copyright to machine learning is that the public would not get to use this tech, only Disney/Warner/ect.<br/><br/>The only thing I could maybe see not backfiring is outlawing the professional; corporate use of models trained on singular still-living artists, because I can see that as being both useful as a tool of protection and targeted enough to avoid overreach, but it would have to be extremely carefully crafted to avoid such. Otherwise, non-consentual use of one&#39;s online body of work for training data should not be handled as a copyright issue, it should be handled as a data privacy issue, and I think you should urge Congress to pass data privacy bills preventing this sort of data harvesting instead of sitting on privacy bills in congress until they die like Chuck Schumer did or pursuing censorious &quot;Think of the children&quot; half-measures like KOSA or EARN IT.<br/><br/>But, there is one area I think you should weigh in on, and that is the idea that &quot;raw&quot; AI art cannot be copyrighted by law. I think this is a good idea to protect artists from displacement by automation, and if I am to give you recommendations on things to do rather than to not do, my number one idea would be to not only explicitly place it into law, but to in fact further define what &quot;human created&quot; works entail and to define it very specifically, because corporate entities would definitely like to find a loophole to automate as much of the artistic process as possible and our goal should be to prevent this and this feels like the most feasible way to do so using the copyright system.<br/><br/>So, TL/DR, do not shrink fair use or expand copyright to include style, because it&#39;d hurt small artists and only benefit megacorps, but place into law and expand the idea of AI art bein automatically public domain as a way of preventing labor displacement via automation.
