Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already utilizing many creators work as part of a dataset/image base, while the original authors see no compensation or even given a heads-up that this is happening. You may post an artwork online of something, an original creation you should own all the rights to because it&#39;s something YOU made, and an AI image generation company may take that image to add to their AI database. You will never be notified of this, you will never receive any monetary compensation. This is incredibly invasive and predatory, as well as something I would assume violates some form of copyright law. AI is widely unregulated as of 9/2/23. <br/><br/>No copy rights should be given to any program, service, machine, or  person(s) that profit or in any way benefit off of other people&#39;s work in the form of thievery. AI is already threatening millions of people&#39;s  livelihoods, and I believe that the path  AI utilization is taking currently in creative industries will end in catastrophe if measures and actions are not taken now. If AI works/influenced works are allowed to go massively unregulated, I fear the precedent it will set for the future.
