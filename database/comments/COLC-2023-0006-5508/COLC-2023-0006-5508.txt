If copyright owners of original artworks are compelled to &quot;opt-out&quot; of those artworks being used for AI content generation rather than AI companies forced to adhere to already existing laws regarding licensing and fair use, there is very little protection against theft and great vulnerability to direct and parasitic competition. The AI generated artworks are a direct competitor to the original artworks, and allowing AI companies to use their competitor&#39;s original artworks as assembly pieces in their own generated product is a ridiculous and extremely damaging proposition. AI companies must comply with already existing norms and regulations surrounding licensed use of a copyrighted material. It doesn&#39;t stop being theft because they put the copyrighted work through a highly technical rube goldberg machine before revealing their unlicensed use.
