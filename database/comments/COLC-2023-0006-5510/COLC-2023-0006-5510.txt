I am of the belief that AI-created works should not be copyrightable for the following reasons:<br/>1. The amount of content used to train them without creator&rsquo;s consent<br/>2. The efforts of corporations to collect more content by automatically opting users of existing products into new AI programs<br/>3. The efforts of corporations to try and purchase the likeness and voices of people for eternal use via AI without proper compensation
