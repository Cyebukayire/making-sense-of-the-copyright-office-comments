These picture AI bots feed on whatever is put into. I can take a screen shot of say micky mouse and put him through one of these picture ai things. Then I can make him just a cute cartoon mouse girl if I wanted. Now what if I said that that&rsquo;s what these bots are doing to everyone&rsquo;s art. Every piece of media can be obscured and spread. It kills creativity. Anything that comes from the bot shouldn&rsquo;t be copyrighted because it isn&rsquo;t an original idea. You&rsquo;re telling a robot to paint you want you want. There&rsquo;s no skill and therefore anyone seeking to copyright  art made from these bots shouldn&rsquo;t be take seriously. The lack the individual idea needed to be patented in anyway shape or form. It should really have been just another silly thing you can do on the internet. It&rsquo;s just an idea thief now. Who needs to write when we can have a robot that we overload with information to give us shitty half baked stories. Nothing that comes from and ai should be copyrighted.
