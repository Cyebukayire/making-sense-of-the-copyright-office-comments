A big concern of AI or artificial intelligence, is the methods used to obtain the data and material needed to train the AI. <br/><br/>AI uses a database of images, music, text, and the like made by people and uploaded to the internet in order to train its ability to produce the corresponding material.This is also known as machine learning. The concern comes in when dealing with how the training data is sourced and from where. Training data sourced from copyrighted material or from users online without explicit permission to use those works poses an ethical issue when it comes to sourcing material needed to train the AI.
