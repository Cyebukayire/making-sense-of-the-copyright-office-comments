As a visual artist and photographer, I&#39;m as concerned as anyone about the impact AI technologies will have on the visual arts. Though competition from AI-generated work on the whole concerns me, my greatest fear is that AI-generated work might, someday, be granted copyright protection. In my opinion, denying AI &quot;art&quot; copyright protections is undoubtedly the right thing to do and essential. AI systems can generate &quot;art&quot; 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 360 days a year. If AI &quot;art&quot; is allowed copyright, the market will become flooded with an untold number of works of all manner of description. If this torrent achieves copyright, human artists stand the risk of, someday, producing work that might be found &quot;derivative&quot; of existing AI work in a court of law simply due to the overwhelming volume of pre-existing AI compositions. No human artist or artists could ever hope to match AI systems in volume and it&#39;d only be a matter of time before a human work, coincidentally, &quot;impinged&quot; on AI content. I believe this is a very real threat.
