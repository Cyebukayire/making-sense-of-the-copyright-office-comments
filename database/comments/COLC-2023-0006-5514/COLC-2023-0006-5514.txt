Hello,<br/><br/>My name is Nina Modaffari, and I have been a professional concept artist for more than 5+ years. I have worked on games such as The Sims 4 and Hero Academy 2, and have worked for various clients such as Riot, Obsidian, and Disney Interactive, to name a few.<br/><br/>AI has been nothing but dangerous towards myself and other artists. I have had friends whose artwork has been STOLEN and SOLD for profit without their consent. I have seen gaming companies implement AI generative tools into their workflow, introducing copyright issues to their workflow instead of simply HIRING an artist to do the work. AI is a dangerous tool in the wrong hands, and at this current moment, all hands currently using it are irresponsible. Without proper laws protecting artists (of all sorts), everyone is at risk. Please stop this from happening. <br/><br/>I do what I do because I love art. I spent decades perfecting my craft because I love what I do. AI cannot love. AI cannot &#39;improve&#39;. It takes and it takes, and does not give back. <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Nina
