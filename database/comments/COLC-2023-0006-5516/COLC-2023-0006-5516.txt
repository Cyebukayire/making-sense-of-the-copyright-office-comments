The use of copyrighted materials to train ai is not a fair use of that material. The usual amount of protections should apply to these situations to prevent unapproved use in that capacity. Seeing a strong regulatory arm used to control the belligerent use of ai seen so far would be a very promising look for the copyright office. I want to see people able to benefit off of their works without having powers stronger than them drowning them in their own efforts. Keep them safe
