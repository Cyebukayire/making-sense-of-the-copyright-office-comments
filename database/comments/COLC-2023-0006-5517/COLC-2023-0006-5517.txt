Hello.<br/>Artificial art cannot exist without the stealing of artist&#39;s work.<br/>It scrapes all the images, artwork, and data it can find, and mashes them together algorithmically.<br/>No piece of AI generated artwork or images is unique, it is simply a blend of stolen work.<br/>There is no reason why AI artwork should be protected or supported by any law - it is just thievery.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that AI art is not supported by the law, because if it is,<br/>it will kill the ability of artists to produce and survive,<br/>less and less original human pieces of artwork will be created,<br/>machine made mashes of data will fool more and more people-<br/>and our lives will be further controlled by machines and data and algorithms...<br/>a beautiful human trait of creativity will be killed by these machines<br/>Please, please please please do not let that happen.
