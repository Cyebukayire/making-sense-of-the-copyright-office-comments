As both a digital and traditional artist, the potential for AI to take over a field that many including myself find enjoyment in is scary. Art is something that should be done for the enjoyment of yourself and others. AI should be used for bettering humanity, and to make people&#39;s lives easier (such as checking over created blueprints, and preventing car accidents), and not for making the enjoyment and fun felt creating art in all its forms more difficult. AI is good for and should be used for automation not for creating pieces of art.
