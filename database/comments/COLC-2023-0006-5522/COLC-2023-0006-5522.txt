AI violates copyright. It gathers data, images and artwork scattered across the web and steals to create a lesser copy. It disrupts the economy for artists in favor of stealing their art, therefore making a profit off of already underpaid labor. Credit should always be given to the artist unless they&#39;ve already given express permission to use their work. Companies and corporations need to recognize that they owe their artists compensation and respect.
