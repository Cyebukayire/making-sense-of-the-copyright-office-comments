I think that large-scale ai should require consent to scan copyrighted works. Specifically, it should be opt-in, and never opt out.<br/>However, anything made with ai should require attribution - either to the artists the AI was trained on, or to the ai itself. Preferably both. The important part, however, is that people know whether the product was made by a human or not.<br/>I have seen excellent works of art made by humans using AI as a tool in the process. One of my favorites is the song Reckless Battery Burns, in which two artists, GHOST and Lily Vane, fed their lyrics to an AI and then used the results as a base to create an amazing work of art that was, ultimately, unmistakably human. I would love to see more like this, but unfortunately, we instead see stuff like Marvel&#39;s Secret Invasion credits where they used AI instead of paying an animator, or the cover of Christopher Paolini&#39;s book Fractal Noise, which was created using an AI instead of paying a cover artist to do a better job.<br/>AI is a tool, and we need to make sure people don&#39;t try to replace the people who use the tool with the tool. A brush cannot paint by itself, only stain the page, and AI is the same way.<br/>Copyright law will certainly help restrict the use of AI. However, it will not do enough on its own, and more protections will likely be needed. And at the same time, we should not restrict AI so much that it becomes impossible to use for the artists that want to use the tool responsibly to do so.<br/>This is a fine line, and I hope that you are capable of walking it.
