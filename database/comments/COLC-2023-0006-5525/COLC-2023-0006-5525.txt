Generative AI is an effort of massive theft and exploitation of artists and creatives, whose sole goal is to transfer power and wealth from skill laborers, artists, to corporatists. GenAI has been built on stolen work, scrubbed from the internet without consent, knowledge of, or compensation to the actual artists and creators. Allowing material that was generated by a machine, with minimal human interaction or direction, that is built completely on appropriated work, to be copyrighted would set a dangerous precedent and be almost as morally corrupt as the creators and exploitative forerunners of this new technology.
