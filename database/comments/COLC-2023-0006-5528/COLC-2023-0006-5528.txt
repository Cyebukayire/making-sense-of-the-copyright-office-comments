I do not believe it should be permitted to file a copyright against any piece of writing, art, music, or other media that was produced by a generative artificial intelligence program. These programs output content by first training a system to copy works it has seen and analyzed before. These works are made by actual human beings, and very frequently are analyzed without the knowledge or permission of the original creator. Z<br/>You may see arguments that these programs are &ldquo;pure logic&rdquo; or &ldquo;just filling in pixels based on a fuzzy algorithm&rdquo;. These arguments are designed to obfuscate real harm by focusing on the pure technology. The theft and copying of existing copyrighted work cannot be separated from the function of these programs. They did not generate their datasets from the aether, those datasets were stolen. There can be no functional generative AI without thousands of copyright violations. <br/>You wouldn&rsquo;t award a copyright to a plagiarized work that stole most of the work from another piece of copyrighted material. Don&rsquo;t award a copyright to a generative AI.
