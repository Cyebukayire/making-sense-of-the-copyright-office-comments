Artificial intelligence programs churn out content directly based on the work of others without their consent (artwork, music, voices) which is unethical. This is especially egregious in cases where the original content creators are deceased (Ex: Using a dead musician&#39;s voice to make an AI song). Because AI programs are fueled directly by the works of others (largely without their consent), works made by said programs should not be eligible for copyright protection. Further, those whose works have been used by AI programs without their consent should be able to serve copyright takedown notices to the owners of said programs.
