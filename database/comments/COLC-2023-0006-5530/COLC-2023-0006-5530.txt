Artificial intelligent is a gross misuse of technology as all it does it collect samples from previously made sources and creates a patchwork of stolen pieces. It takes things out of context and without restraint. It is a generator of an amalgamation of what is made. People post art that takes them hours and energy and this just steals it to put into a blender with other images similar to it to create something. People write stories that take time and research and previous experiences and it takes that with others and blends it into a story. There are many different people with many different cultures and experiences and AI takes only the most popular or prevalent to take its fill and produces content that is an insult to the people it is trying to &quot;represent&quot;. It is a copy machine that cannot think and the only people who would use it for commercial use would use it uncaringly and generate inappropriate stories and images. It shouldn&#39;t be used.
