It&#39;s my opinion that while AI itself is a useful tool, it is being misused to harm people. AI should be treated as a statistics tool that is not capable of creating new things without being trained on existing data, and that data belongs to whoever made it. In the case of AI-generated art, artists should have some way to protect their work from being used to train AIs, and those that do have their work used to train them should be compensated in some way, because the resulting AI product would not exist without the help of the artist. It is also my opinion that AI should not be used to write articles about facts or current events without being labelled as AI-generated, and these generated articles should not be prioritized over written ones in search engines. It has been my experience that artists and creators generally feel negatively not towards AI itself but its users, and that replacing qualified teams with AI due to cost is lazy and will create lower-quality work.
