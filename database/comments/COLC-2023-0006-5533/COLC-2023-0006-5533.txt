The notion of copyrighting styles is absurd. The majority of art schools teach by observing prior art without the express consent of the producer of the reference material. In fact, it is even encouraged. The way AI models are trained is not much different. As someone who makes art myself, I want to be able to leverage the technological benefits AI provides in order to produce and enhance both art and assets I desire. That said infringing trademarks is something I can sympathize with wanting to extert control over. For example, while training on images from something like GettyImages should be considered fair use (derivative art, produces new novel technology as AI models, styles can&#39;t be copyrighted, etc)... generating images with its watermark should disallowed.
