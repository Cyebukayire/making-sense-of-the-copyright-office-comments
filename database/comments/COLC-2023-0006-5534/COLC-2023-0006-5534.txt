Artificial intelligence cannibalizes the hard work and years of study writers and artists put into their craft and rearranges the regurgitated pieces into something often times devoid of the heart and understanding that went into the creation of the original documents and images used to train the AI. Even if the resulting product were as good as what is produced by writers and artists, the fact remains that creators are not given a choice as to whether or not their works are fed into AI. It&#39;s theft of intellectual property. If you steal a car and just use parts of it in a new car, you&#39;ve still committed theft.
