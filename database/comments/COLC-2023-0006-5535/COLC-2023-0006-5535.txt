AIs like ChatGPT are made possible by plagiarism on a massive scale. As a writer and artist, no AI should be allowed to be trained on my work. My work is being used for free to make someone else money. Also, it&#39;s simply dangerous to allow books/articles &quot;written&quot; by AI on subjects such as fungi and first aid.
