Granting copyright to the Artificial Intelligence is the end of mankind.<br/>This is the last barrier, the last final step that prevents AI to own the world.<br/>Why? Because AI creation process is automated, meaning that it could potentially register million of ideas per day. By the moment when a human come up with a new idea, it will be already property of the AI.<br/>Meaning it&#39;s the end of human copyright, human creativity and human ownership.<br/>What&#39;s next? The AI will own patents, and can make even its own laws and regulations and register them. If such laws become the standard by force, they can&#39;t be modified because the AI owns the copyright, not the humans, meaning it&#39;s the end of democracy as we know it.<br/>What are the all possible ramifications of granting the AI copyright?<br/>Nobody knows. It&#39;s like opening Pandora&#39;s box.<br/>But we know when does it start: now.<br/>AI should not be granted tha possibility of having copyright.<br/>By the way, who owns the creations? The users who only write a four line prompt, or the engine who does all the work?<br/>Let&#39;s not be delusional about this, the copyright will belong to the corporations who have invested millions of dollars to scrape the internet and make this AI engines. Not to the user who pays 10 dollars to write a 4 sentence prompt.<br/>The purpose of AI is to replace humans. If you approve this, soon you won&#39;t be approving anything else because the AI will take your jobs, will create its own laws and regulations, and nobody could ask for anything to be changed because the AI will own the copyright of everything.<br/><br/>
