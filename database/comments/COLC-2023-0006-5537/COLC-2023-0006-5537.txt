The risks of this technology as it is currently will have large consequences, making life across the US &amp; potentially even the world more difficult to live in as a creator, copyright owner, technology developer, researcher, &amp; public. There already has been sensitive &amp; personal data in images &amp; documents leaked through AI, which can be dangerous to all. There has been confusion over works derived from individuals who&#39;s likeness/style have clearly been used in the training data, &amp; sold works similar to their style using AI cheaper than the original can make. As a copyright owner, that is lost revenue or exposure to their own works, where if given permission or compensated this could be resolved. For developers, researchers, &amp; the public, there is great risk of works being created with false information but appears sound. For example, there is an AI generated mushroom foraging book which could have false information unintentionally due to not having been touched by human hands. There is also AI generated voices which can confuse the public on what an individual has said, which could be extremely harmful for politicians or individuals in the public eye.  AI generated voices also would harm creators &amp; actors from what was said above, unless protections are given. Some benefits could be that work may be done faster using AI, but human intervention is necessary. It could help research greatly, as well as help general education at a faster pace. It needs to be used as a tool, not a sentient intelligent being with its own will, as it will make mistakes. AI will not specifically raise a unique issue for my industry, but would have an affect on my life &amp; my copyrighted works. Consistency should matter internationally as very frequently AI use is global. Products made by AI should not be able to be copyrighted, as currently the technology does not truly have any &#39;intelligence&#39;, &amp; essentially cannot &#39;create&#39; without input from works already made, &amp; so infringes on their works. Compensation/permission is necessary for AI training databases especially if commercialized (the AI product itself or the work derived using AI), not an option. If an individual uses their own works in a database &amp; no other person&#39;s works, as well as having created the AI code, then the AI produced piece could make a case to be copyrighted as it would be derived from works they have made themselves. Copyrighted works should be illegal to be used in AI training databases, however one may allow a copyrighted work only if given permission by the original creator of the work(s) given for training. If an output is found similar to a copyrighted work &amp; does not qualify as fair, then there should be a larger portion of liability apportioned to the developer, as the user may not intentionally have done. This includes works involving &quot;style transfer&quot; algorithms, which is taking an existing image &amp; recreating it in a particular style. This is an issue of the technology not being &#39;intelligent&#39;  but instead mimicking patterns, seen through AI works derived from images frequently including artist&#39;s signatures who expressed not having given permission for their works to be used. This, as well as artist&#39;s who have passed away who have no say on this new technology. There must be protection of individual&#39;s likeness/voice/art style, where permission may be given for short periods of time like 2-10 years through contracts with fair wages over that period of time, including notification/payment every time they use their likeness if a commercialized product. It should never a life-time nor for the rest of time, &amp; permission to continue using may be re-granted at any point. If an individual has given written permission to use their likeness after death, ones likeness may be used. This should include compensation when their likeness is used to their family, if part of their permission. However, a family member would not be allowed to give permission after death as it may have gone against an individual&#39;s wishes, unable to speak for themselves. There must be tools to protect voices &amp; images from individuals to prevent abuse.  Segregating the source data for a new machine-learning project into multiple pieces may help the algorithm &#39;forget&#39;. Each section can be processed separately, before the results are combined into the final machine-learning model. If an AI training database is completely free to use, &amp; works derived from unable to make commercialized products from, then it could constitute as fair use. Any AI training database must be opt in, never opt out by default. Scraping internet images through various websites, or taking a movie&#39;s frames to mimic the style, would not be allowed unless those websites/film companies/etc give explicit permission. Databases must show what the AI is given so that if copyrighted works are accidentally added, they may be removed with ease. Non-copyrighted material may be used, but still must be shown publicly.
