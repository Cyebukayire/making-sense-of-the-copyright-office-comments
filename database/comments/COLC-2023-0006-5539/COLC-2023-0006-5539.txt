AI should be a tool and no more -- AI-created art can&#39;t be allowed to put artists out of business, AI-created writing can&#39;t be allowed to put writers out of business. Not only does AI creative endeavors lack creativity, but while some of the products can pass as &quot;okay&quot; products, overall human ingenuity is better than AI learning/remixing.
