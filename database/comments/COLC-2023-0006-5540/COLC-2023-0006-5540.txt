Artists are already synonymous with starving and AI art is founded on mass theft of labor targeting them.  Sampling music has its controversies to this day and it still requires learned skills and effort to use, not to mention multiple parties&#39; clearances for its source material.  Machine learning requires no effort and takes from larger numbers of worse-off creators while large companies can skirt their permissions.  With few exceptions, AI art is just an algorithm designed to prey on and exploit the vulnerable.  Even its name is fraudulent and it is no coincidence that so many of its proponents come from other scams with a futuristic veneer like cryptocurrency.<br/><br/>Worse, it will not improve art.  Since the technology can only regurgitate what was fed into it, what it really does is flood the world with countless derivative versions of existing media but with none of the creativity or inventiveness you get from humans, even by accident.  It then salts the earth by disincentivizing human creators so there will be far less new material for anybody to draw from.  Gallery and social media sites are already flooded by identical-looking AI creations and it can only lead to further stagnation.  We already have media over-saturation and ugly, copy/pasted meme art.  All AI art can do is further increase their quantity while forever reducing their quality.<br/><br/>You don&#39;t have to be a Luddite to understand some technologies only worsen the world.  AI art is the leaded gasoline of digital media, demanding countless ethical violations just to make us all dumber.
