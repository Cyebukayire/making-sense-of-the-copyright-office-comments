AI can be used in so many dangerous ways disregarding the utter lack of protection in copying from someone else&#39;s artwork. It could be used to make incredibly harmful propaganda. It is inherently ableist, racist, and misogynistic. Out of 100 attempts in trying to search for a female drawing it is only shown twice out of the 98 white men when &quot;creating&quot; an image of an autistic person. In these same images none were smiling. This could be an issue in it not growing as fast as people like, but the fact at all that it can imitate such things and be used to make them into harmful caricatures.
