As a fan of creative works, who works for and with licensed artists in the graphic design world, I am increasingly disturbed by the blas&eacute; attitude towards AI.  <br/><br/>Copyright should NOT be granted to ANY AI program. AI programs are nothing more than yet another way to steal from the true creators of entertainment media: the artists, musicians, writers, and actors.  The DMCA was enacted to protect the copyright of the creators; AI programs should be barred from violating this law and it is appalling that they are allowed to blatantly break this law at the current time.  They are robbing human creatives of their ability to make a living, pay their bills and care for their families.<br/><br/>These programs should either be outlawed or meticulously monitored, with severe monetary and legal penalties enforced against any company creating these programs if the company continues to steal and exploit copyrighted content that does not belong to them and that they do not have permission to use.<br/><br/>In fact, the ONLY way these programs should be allowed to continue to be available to use is to ERASE their databases and start from scratch.  They can be restarted with only true royalty free content whose copyright has legally expired and with submissions of material whose creators wish to opt their creations into the AI database.
