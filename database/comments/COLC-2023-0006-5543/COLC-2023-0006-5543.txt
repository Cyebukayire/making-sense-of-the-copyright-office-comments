Hello! <br/>Generative AI tools train on massive datasets of images and text like LAION, which are scraped from the internet under the guise of &#39;research&#39;-- only for that data to immediately be used in commercial products like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Adobe Firefly, etc. <br/>The copyright owners of these materials are never asked for consent, or even notified-- and there is often no way to definitively verify whether or not copyrighted works were used to train generative AI. For these reasons, it&#39;s very clear that generative AI can only ever operate on an OPT-IN system where only copyright holders who ACTIVELY grant consent will have their work used as training data, in exchange for appropriate compensation. Additionally, it&#39;s clear that training generative AI tools on copyrighted works is in violation of copyright and is illegal. <br/><br/>Generative AI does not analyze and learn training data in a way similar to human learning. All outputs are, necessarily, direct derivatives of inputs-- there is no original creation.  <br/><br/>As established in already-existing court cases on the issue, generations from generative AI cannot quality for copyright, due to the lack of human authorship. Because individuals prompting the generative AI cannot reliably predict the precise outcome of the generative AI, there is no intentional authorship.  <br/><br/>Generative AI was made, explicitly, to compete in the same market as, and to replace existing creatives. This is evident in the fact that SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL CREATIVES&#39; NAMES are common prompts used in generative AI-- in order to copy the creative&#39;s personal style. Further, existing creatives cannot fairly compete in a market with generative AI. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. <br/>
