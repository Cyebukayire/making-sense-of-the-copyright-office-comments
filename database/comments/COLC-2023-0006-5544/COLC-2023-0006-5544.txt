Intellectual property law was designed to protect the creative capital of the small artist from the exploitation. But it has had the exact opposite effect. Intellectual Property laws have allowed large media conglomerates to commodify and indefinitely hoard aspects of American popular culture which should belong to everyone. Meanwhile, starving artists are still very much a thing, as most artists cannot afford to pursue a cause of action even when their ideas are plagiarized.<br/><br/>I believe limiting the scope of this debate to the realm of new technology is folly, and framing the debate in this way is sure to produce nothing but unjust results down the line. Instead, we should view the contradictions and ambiguity this new technology introduces, as a death knell for IP law altogether.<br/><br/>Ideas do not come from individuals. They arise from a thousand disparate influences which the law cannot realistically expect to keep track of. The absurd idea that an idea can be owned and kept away from anyone else who wishes to use it, has lead to censorship and (in the case of medical research) death. Furthermore, the notion that human beings would not be motivated to make art or invent without a monetary incentive to do so is premised on a completely backwards understanding of human psychology. Capitalism does not encourage creativity; the leading factor in what causes someone to be a creative contributor to society at large is whether they are given any luxury time to be creative.<br/><br/>I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t listen to this warning. I&#39;m sure you will instead opt to try to find a way to &quot;adapt&quot; the current laws for this new technology. But I am warning you the laws themselves are already fundamentally broken. And any attempt to modernize them will simply signify more struggling in the tangled web we&#39;ve already woven.<br/><br/>I urge you to make the radical choice and begin to abolish the concept of Intellectual Property altogether. There are thousands of better models we have not yet considered, in terms of how artists can/should be compensated for their labor.<br/><br/>-- Citizen of the Earth. Heather E. Calun.
