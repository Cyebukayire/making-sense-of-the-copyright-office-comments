If I were to walk into a woodcarving store and steal a statue, then paint it and re-sell it then I&#39;ve still stolen a statue. All I&#39;ve done is slap a fancy bit of paint on it. If I were to take several statues, break them apart and attach them together with glue and then sell it, I&#39;ve still stolen a half dozen statues.<br/><br/>If I tell an AI to generate a work it chops and changes a half million works and glues them together in a way it&#39;s algorithms think is right, but the AI cannot ask permission or buy the work it wants to use. It&#39;s no different than our wood store thief version of me, stealing someone else&#39;s work, smashing it to pieces and gluing it together.<br/><br/>I am not an American, but ultimately, what America decides to do in terms of copyright and AI will ripple across the rest of the world in some form. If nothing is done, if AI &#39;artworks&#39; continue to not be regulated in America then the same applies to most countries that use the internet.
