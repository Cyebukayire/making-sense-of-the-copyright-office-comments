Unregulated AI is a threat to me because I&#39;m a recently graduated storyboard artist and I fear that my career as well as my education will amount to nothing if companies choose to utilize AI instead of real living people. I have reason to believe they will as it is already happening to many artists around the globe. This situation can be changed if AI is regulated and copyright protections are put in place.
