The impact that &quot;AI&quot; or more accurately &quot;Generative Algorithm&quot; developing and utilizing groups has had on the internet has been a resolutely negative experience. Between rampant scamming and theft of work for creating &quot;artificial mimics&quot; of artists, scraping of large archive sites such as Archive Of Our Own (also without the original creators permission), and the general negative and &quot;anti-human&quot; sentiment created by the usage of this technology I cannot in good conscience believe that it should remain unregulated for both the public and private corporations. Companies have now been rapidly attempting to utilize this technology to replace art teams and designers for the sake of cutting costs which has resulted in worse products across the media fields of the United States. <br/><br/>I believe that this technology should be regulated to ONLY research and investigative use. It can be interesting for creating digital approximations of concepts (based on the inputs and how the algorithm is shaped by the creators being the major limiting factors) but the use of it for marketed &quot;products&quot; is inherently disingenuous to consumers and will continue to harm Americans and individuals in the long run. By regulating this kind of technology to only be within research and academic fields/uses it could be better fine tuned and understood so that proper legislation and public understanding could be cultivated around it so that &quot;AI&quot; can be properly reintroduced to the public in a more healthy and less malign way. If something like that was even possible, as determined by researchers and ethics analysis.<br/><br/>Please understand that I state all of this as someone who loves the concept behind this technology, but its rampant misuse and the harm it has caused to real people cannot be ignored and must be properly dealt with if we are to form proper legislation around this kind of technology that will not mimic the dogmatic copyright laws of music or the asinine laws of general copyright.
