Hi, thank you for allowing input from people publicly!<br/>I&#39;m an artist and a writer, and I firmly believe the right to my own art, in whatever form it may be, not being used for AI training without my explicit consent, is essential. Respecting the copyright an artist has over their work, within&#39; limitations of time is getting harder and harder to protect these days. There has been consistent application of a writer or artists&#39; right to the copyright of their work. From my experience and knowledge of this, as an artist, I believe allowing the unconsensual data scraping to happen to all of us on the internet and beyond in one fell swoop would be a terrible idea and I object to it entirely.<br/>Considering this is a topic close to my chest, I apologize if I come off as overly emotional, but this is an honest statement. I earn some of my living by making money with my works, and this would be quite a blow to me and many others, has already happened to many. Please consider taking a strong stance against allowing AI to be trained on copyrighted works without the actual creator&#39;s knowing agreement.<br/>Thank you for your time in reading these comments and allowing artists and those that support them being able to protect their craft and works, and speak their mind about it.
