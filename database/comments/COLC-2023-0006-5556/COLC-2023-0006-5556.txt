1) No work should be used to train AI models without explicit and prior permission from its creators or owners. This permission should be obtained on an individual basis for each piece used (ie. no scraping websites, databases, or archives, and no websites whose TOS mandate or assume permission). If you don&#39;t have permission for something, then it can&#39;t be used to train AI models under penalty of wiping the model&#39;s training data. Lack of copyright does not imply permission. Creative Commons does not imply permission. Works in the public domain might be acceptable to use for training. <br/>2) Works without a sapient creator/author should not be copyrightable. A creator who uses AI creations as a part of their work (ie. a collage or tracing) are trickier, so a decent compromise might be that someone should not be able to claim copyright more strict than say the creative commons for the piece they used AI to help create. <br/>2a) A creator who uses an AI creation as an accessory (? I don&#39;t know the legal term sorry) to their copyrighted work (like an author using AI to produce a book cover) the main work and the accessory should fall under different copyright (in this example, the book and the cover would be considered separately. author could claim copyright for the text that they wrote but not for the image on the cover that they didn&#39;t create. If they hire, say, a painter to make their cover, they can work out copyright for that as normal.) <br/>3) Liability for infringing works generated by AI systems: Normal C&amp;D if it&#39;s being used to make money, maybe an investigation into the permissions of everything used to train the AI network<br/>3a) If the owners of the AI are found to have not obtained proper permissions for anything in their training data OR have incomplete records of their training data, they may be forced to remove the offending piece or, failing that, delete the entire trained program and start from scratch. Make them keep detailed and rigorous records of everything they use and the necessary permissions under the threat of undoing all that they have gathered. Transparency is king here otherwise people will lie to you.<br/>4) Style isn&#39;t copyrightable. It shouldn&#39;t be. It&#39;s far to difficult to draw the line. That is why accountability, transparency, and getting permissions ahead of time should be of critical importance to legislation regarding this issue. You need to go after the training data and make sure that everything is sanctioned for such use by whomever created it. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading! <br/><br/>The priorities I have kept in mind writing this are that individual artists&#39; and owners rights are respected and respected equally, and that their intents and rights should not be undermined by the existence of a tool they could not previously take into account (due to it not existing until recently.)
