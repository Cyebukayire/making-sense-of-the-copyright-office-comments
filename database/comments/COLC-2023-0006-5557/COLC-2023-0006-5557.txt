I do not believe that works created with AI should be granted copyrights or protections. They are in my opinion as an artist, writer, and general creative; plageristic tools which have already been poisoned by stolen works, from artists no longer alive to give consent, or are otherwise ripe for abuse and missuse. To say nothing of being already used to perpetuate misinformation and problems. While I know the technology cannot be eradicated now that it exists, I strongly believe that artists, writers, and creatives in general as humans should be respected in their fields and not made redundant by allowing this technology to be misused by those with no understanding of the harm these technologies currently pose and it needs to be regulated and prevented from being copyrightable. I hope this makes sense. I know others could make a more elegant and persuasive argument against AI but I did wish to put in my two-cents against such a technology.
