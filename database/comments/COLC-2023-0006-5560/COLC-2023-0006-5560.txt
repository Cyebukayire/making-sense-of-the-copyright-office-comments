AI without humans is nothing. AI needs to be fed up with data to be able to generate something. And right now all AI companies out there have been feeding their &quot;tech&quot; with our works, our personal data, etc. without our consent.<br/><br/>And with that, all the generated &quot;works&quot; that AI &quot;made&quot; contain the works of hundreds or thousands or maybe more people from around the globe, hence it&#39;s unethical. While those AI companies and those AI users that use the tech to get instant income (ie. AI users who generate hundreds of pictures within minutes and sell them on the marketplace) keep generating funds from stealing people&#39;s works and data, those whose data got scrapped from the internet and fed to their AI made 0 income and no royalty from it.<br/><br/>Unless those companies use their own data to train their AI, there&#39;s no way AI-made works can be copyrighted (1) because they are generated based on stolen data (2) because they have no full control of what they generate using the machine<br/><br/>Last, if there is still no regulation about AI and copyright, this tech brings nothing but destruction, especially to creative industries, like artists, musicians, authors, voice actors, etc. whose works are used to replace them in the industries, meanwhile, they got nothing from it.
