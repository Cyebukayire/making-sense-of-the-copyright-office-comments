Artificial Intelligence is currently plaguing the internet. It&rsquo;s filling search engines with blatant misinformation, muddying the ability to find actual pictures of animals, and clogging websites with pieces that nobody actually spent time on. As well, it threatens an entire industry of people who would be forced to further clog up the job market elsewhere in order to live.<br/>The programs that AI advocates utilize steal en masse from artists and internet-goers. It is a machine, not a sapient being; It cannot take inspiration or purposefully creare derivative content based off of the images it is stealing. These programs are built on a core layer of thievery. As such, content that utilizes it should be completely uncopywriteable, if not banned entirely. If a program exploits content put out into the public as if that content was free, it should be 100% free to view content with it; AI images should never be copywritable, and unable to earn profit.
