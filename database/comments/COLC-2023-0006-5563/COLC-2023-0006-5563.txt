Given that it&rsquo;s known far and wide that AI has to essentially, at best, collage together a variety of taken objects such as images, it seems obvious to me that&rsquo;s clearly going to run into a million copyright issues. AI lacks true individual human-level intelligence and as such is unable to create a truly individual idea or concept. Recent upticks in bots in places like fanfic sites, art pages on various social media, do seem to indicate that people have already set off their own bots to simply steal as much content as possible regardless of source. I understand that when it comes to the new AI trend no AI developer wants to fall behind and not have some new fun &ldquo;toy&rdquo; to maintain relevance in such speedy times. Though that has now lead to countless occurrences of stealing, pretending to be someone/replicating their work, etc. Someone doesnt like how a story goes? they use an AI to add a whole new alternate ending. No new art pieces from someone? They feed the artists catalogue into the system, and now they can &ldquo;create&rdquo; as many vague copies as they so desire. Its extremely displeasing to any creative, researcher, coder, or really any job that takes some presence online, that their work can be twisted and altered in any which minor way and spouted out some faux-original idea. In any sense, there is no way the current function of AI is anything but a copyright violation machine, there is no ethical way in which anyone or any company should be allowed to make money from what is someone else&rsquo;s work, given how blatant the copying is at times.
