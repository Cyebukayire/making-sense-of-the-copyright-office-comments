I feel as if allowing AI to have copyrighted works is a bit of a slap in the face to those who work hard on their craft whether that be writing for scripts, books, etc. Not only would it create controversy on who then owns the AI and could create problems for consumers of the media the AI created (thinking of YouTube and its copyright strike function that barely works correctly).<br/><br/>It would also be a step to cut out unions in the entertainment industry because so many big studios want to use AI work to get around paying writers for script work. AI isn&rsquo;t even a true intelligence but will only repeat back information like a parrot from whatever prompt or writing samples it was scouring for information from.<br/><br/>All in all, being a writer (even if I haven&rsquo;t written anything like a book yet) has me worried about our future if storytelling can just be so cheaply automated and can take over human thought and consideration in a way that be easily weaponized through copyright claims. Then it just becomes &lsquo;who has enough money in court&rsquo; if anything comes up which most Americans do not compared to big companies. I ask of this Agency to really look at this as a serious attack on the creative freedoms of the people who will just have their work stolen by a robotic parroting system with nothing they can do about it other than not publish anything at all. Thank you.
