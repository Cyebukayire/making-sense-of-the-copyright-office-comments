I believe that AI in general is actively stealing the work of artists, including but not limited too writers, illustrators, photographers, etc. From my knowledge, AI takes the query that it is given and searches the internet for the best answer, and the answer that it gives its recipient does not credit any Individuals wot may have published what the AI used to answer. As an artist, this is scary for artists like me because they take away works from artists and do not credit them, and if AI improved, artists could lose their jobs even though over half of what the AI has made is stole from said artists. In some ways AI can help people and make lives easier, but it discredits individuals who work hard doing their jobs.
