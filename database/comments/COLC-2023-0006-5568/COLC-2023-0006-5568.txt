To whom it may concern,<br/>AI-generated art and writing absolutely constitute plagiarism. AI is fundamentally incapable of creating anything new. It only skims content from its database and re-assembles it. It constitutes the theft of the works used in generating AI &quot;art&quot;, as the companies behind AI programs are using the entire contents of the Internet as their database, without the knowledge or consent of thise theyre taking from.<br/>This is damaging to the economy, as advertising agencies and media studios will use AI to &quot;create&quot; their content instead of paying writers and artists, putting tens of thousands of people out of work.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the nature of that content is actively degrading as more and more of it is being generated by other AI programs. This is a legitimate problem as a potential source of misinformation. Attached are two screen-shots taken from Q&amp;A website Quora. These images represent typical AI-generated responses to questions on the site from two different programs. Note that they contain obvious internal contradictions that are fundamentally wrong.<br/><br/>AI does not care about facts or real data. A recent study shows that ChatGPT&#39;s ability to accurately answer basic math equations has reduced from 95% accuracy, to under 2%.<br/>Imagine the bedlam thar could be caused by people who blindly believe the output of these programs that only produce answers by algorithm, trawling the sequence of words on articles on issues of science, politics, and public health without reference to what those words actually MEAN.<br/><br/>Do the right thing. Shut down AI.
