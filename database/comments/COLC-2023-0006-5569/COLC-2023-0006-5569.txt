The use of AI in creative processes must be regulated. As it stands, what could be a useful tool is being widely used for what amounts to mass plagiarism. The algorithms are trained on the work of others who are not made or aware and have not given their consent for their work to be used this way.<br/>It is also my opinion that should rampant AI use continue with no restriction or regulation, the future of this burgeoning technology will be bleak. As visual artists and other creatives recede under the threat of AI as it currently is, there will be little material for the algorithms to train on. There have already been reports of AI cannibalizing the products of other algorithms and producing garbage that is effectively digital inbreeding. The sooner this technology is regulated and norms for its use are established, the sooner it can be developed as a useful tool to aid artists, not to replace them, and to be used ethically.
