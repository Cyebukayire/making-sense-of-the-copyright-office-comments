Hello, I am a teacher living in France and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods.<br/><br/>This technology has already done damage due to a lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse.<br/><br/>Unregulated AI is a threat because it can destroy all the efforts people put into the mastery of their work, in art, music, writing, voice acting, or research. It could be a helpful tool, yet it blurs the line between those who worked to achieve mastery in their field and those who use AI just for fun and yet claim to deserve the same praises when they used a tool that shamelessly copied the hard work of those previous people.<br/><br/>Plus, with the line blurred, the value of artists/writers/voice actors/musicians/researchers, immensely decreases, messing with prices and putting dirt on the reputation of their job.<br/><br/>It&#39;s even more insulting and dangerous when the AI uses their work as its database, because AI can&#39;t create something without using someone else&#39;s work to learn, without even crediting their inspiration.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.<br/><br/>Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.<br/><br/>Thank you.
