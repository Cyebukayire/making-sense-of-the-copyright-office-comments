Re: Copyright Office<br/>[Docket No. 2023-6]<br/>Artificial Intelligence and Copyright<br/><br/>I am making this submission on behalf of myself.<br/><br/>General Questions:<br/><br/>Question 34<br/><br/>Answer,<br/><br/>The are huge problems related to the way AI systems have unlawfully acquired data for AI training. For instance the law of Germany is quite unique as corporate ownership of copyright is not possible.<br/><br/>Germany has a monistic system of copyright which means that even economic rights are inalienable.<br/><br/>It means there is no such thing as &quot;corporate ownership&quot; of copyright in Germany.<br/><br/>In Germany, a corporation can&#39;t pay for research and then &#39;own that research&#39; themselves based on the fact they paid for it. The research can&#39;t actually be owned by anyone. Thus to give preferential treatment to a corporation that was influential in some way, such as providing compute as Stability AI did for LAION researchers in Germany, would be unlawful. (German Copyright Act &sect;60d)<br/><br/>https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_urhg/englisch_urhg.html<br/><br/>Stability AI inc were in fact given preferential treatment and then unlawfully released LAION research to the wider world.<br/><br/>It means that the research should never have been released to anyone let alone made &quot;open source&quot; (DSM copyright Directive article 3)<br/><br/>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj<br/><br/>The fact that LAION did that, is legally problematic for them (possible criminal repercussions) and now they are making excuses by saying the data is only links. But it&#39;s still &quot;research&quot; allowing access to billions of images, and should still not have been released to a private company (Stability AI inc) or the public. (e.g. like a research virus should never be released even if a firm paid for it)<br/><br/>So this means that &quot;even for research&quot; Stability AI inc don&#39;t have &quot;lawful access&quot; which is a condition of any copyright exception.
