A simplified example of how AI works using Sydney Sheldon case study.<br/><br/>Sarah Silverman has sued Open AI for copyright infringement because Open AI used her original works and books without<br/>permission to train their AI system to write books like the way she writes her books. <br/><br/>Does her case have any hold? The answer is no. Sarah Silverman is suing a computer for reading her books. <br/>She does not sue her human readers for reading her books. So why is she suing a computer, or actually an AI system, for reading her books?<br/><br/>To understand AI such as chatGPT one must understand a very important word called &quot;Model&quot;<br/>AI technology works with with &quot;learning models&quot;. It is not copying, changing and presenting the same information from an original author. <br/><br/>We can use Sydney Sheldon, an author of about 18 fictional novels to understand what model is in AI systems such as chatGPT .<br/>Also to show that  that AI does not plagiarize, copy, modify content and redistribute original content from the original author.<br/><br/>AI does not make copies of peoples work. Only it is good in reading and learning, or we can say training on other peoples work.<br/>AI, being a computer is extremely efficient in reading, studying, classifying and making conclusions on any original content and can <br/>thereby make similar outputs without a need to copy and paste from an original author. <br/><br/>But it has to trained on the original author. That training does not constitute copyright infringement.<br/>You cannot sue a person for reading your book. And you cannot sue them for &quot;writing like you&quot; or for &quot;drawing like you&quot;.<br/><br/>Back to Sydney Sheldon case study to understand how AI works. People have enjoyed reading Sydney Sheldon 18 fictional novels for years and years.<br/>What an AI system such as chatGPT can do with Sydney Sheldon 18 novels, being a computer, is to read read all the 18 novels by Sydney Sheldon<br/>in a matter of minutes if not seconds. <br/>And secondly and very important to generate a &quot;Sydney Sheldon model&quot; . <br/>This Sydney Sheldon model is the artificial intelligence or artificial understanding of who Sydney Sheldon is.<br/>In other words the Sydney Sheldon model makes the computer for once to think and feel like it were a human being that knew a lot if not <br/>everything there was was to know about Sydney Sheldon. <br/>So the original copies of Sydney Sheldon 18 novels, that would in fact cause copyright issues, no longer have to reside inside the AI system. <br/>What is inside the AI system is a model of Sydney Sheldon; the topics he would be interested in writing about, sentence structures, <br/>story lines, dramatic scenes and all those presentations by Sydney Sheldon. <br/><br/>It is this model now that AI such as chatGPT can use to write another 100 novels that would all sound like Sydney Sheldon, in plot, topic, <br/>suspense, creativity and grammar, all without a single repeated sentence from any of the 18 existing fictional novels. <br/><br/>But can he then sue the AI system for reading his books? Again no. Not more than he could sue any human being for reading his books for entertainment.<br/>It just so happened a computer too, an AI system, read his books. And he cannot sue it for that. Unless he first sues all his worldwide fans who have read his novels.<br/><br/>AI is a new technology. Understanding how it works shows it does not plagiarize, copy , modify and redistribute original works. The only thing AI could be accused of, is being faster at reading and making models of what it reads.<br/><br/>To see the sample power of AI visit https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en and there you will see real human beings that do not and have never existed on planet earth. They are all AI generated. <br/><br/>And just now I am asking chatGPT to give me an uplifting 5 sentence poem with catchy rhymes.<br/><br/>In reply i get:<br/>In the dawn&#39;s gentle embrace we find our way,<br/>Each sunrise brings hope to brighten the day.<br/>With courage, we rise, face challenges anew,<br/>In the journey of life, there&#39;s always breakthrough.<br/><br/>This poem by AI does not exist by any author on earth.<br/>chatGPT has created it from one of its many trained language models.<br/><br/>And because we were talking about Sydney Sheldon if I tell chatGPT this.<br/>Me: &gt;&gt; if i was to write dramatic novels that sounded like Sydney Sheldon please suggest 10 novel titles that i would write<br/><br/>and in a few seconds i have recommendations list from chatGPT AI  <br/><br/>chatGPT: &gt;&gt;<br/><br/>1<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Whispers of Betrayal<br/>2<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Secrets at Sunset<br/>3<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Dangerous Alliances<br/>4<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Desperate Deceptions<br/>5<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Hidden Agendas<br/>6<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Tangled Destinies<br/>7<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Fatal Obsessions<br/>8<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Shadows of the Past<br/>9<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Power Games<br/>10<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Price of Ambition<br/><br/>Again this list of novels does not exist anywhere on earth except by natural coincidence.<br/>The list is part of one of the many chatGPT trained models of who Sydney Sheldon is.<br/>And even more chatGPT can also generate those novels, ideally of course, and they would all read like they<br/>were written by Sydney Sheldon!<br/><br/>Peter Kamakia<br/>Systems programmer.<br/>GOTECH international<br/>Nairobi Kenya<br/>Tel 254 720 219320
