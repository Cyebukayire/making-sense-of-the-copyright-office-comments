Artificial Intelligence relies on theft and plagarism in order to produce its works. Copyright should not be awarded to the human who input the request or the machine who fulfilled it, as it was simply stripped from original content. AI generated works are, in my opinion, inelligible for a copyright, and may even be a copyright violation in their own right.
