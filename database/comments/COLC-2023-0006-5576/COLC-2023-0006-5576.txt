I fail to see how any computer can &quot;own copyrights&quot; to something when it&rsquo;s method of &quot;creation&quot; is by hoovering up every image (for example) that it can find on the topic that it wants to create an image of and then spitting out an amalgamation of them all. A Frankenstein of the collective. This is not a creative process, therefore it cannot be copyrighted.<br/>A computer will never create, it will only mimic.
