I think it&#39;s very worrying how the companies behind the different AI databases and platforms are justifying their actions of stealing from uncountable artist worldwide, with the excuse &quot;we do it for the science&quot;. No they don&#39;t. They told everyone that their AI can learn like humans, like we saw in a few sci-fi movies, but it&#39;s a lie. They lie in hope that stupid investors will give them money to finance their project. If it would learn, you could load up your children&#39;s drawings, in a few years it would make fantastic pieces like Da Vinci and other grand masters. But it won&#39;t happen. Why? Because it&#39;s only a fancy copy and paste mechanism. Just like google showing me picture of the things I searched for. Is google the creator of those pictures? no! It only shows the results readable as this item. The same for AI, it reads the picture and sees &quot;this part is the sky&quot; okay, so next time someone is prompting &quot;sky&quot; I will show them this. And I really think it is disgusting how they all act like they are some scientific or even artist, only interested in the human to create more art. Non of them has a creative background, they all have studied business and other things. Not a single one created anything creative. And you want to tell me now they want to put hours into art? No they only want the results of on an artist, but do not intend to put any labor into it. They want money. Not art. They don&#39;t value the artists work in any way. We have to put a stop to their lame excuses and finally see them for who they are and what they want.
