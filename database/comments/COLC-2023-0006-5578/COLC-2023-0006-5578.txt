For humans, creating things is according to our experiences. For AI, it is according to what is fed into the algorithms. Typically, humans are required to credit sources for information, but the mind is not infallible. We cannot be expected to say where every piece of information comes from. However, AI is able to. Therefore, for AI to create, yet not credit the sources of information is a form of plagiarism. To patent something that comes out of a data-processing algorithm is to engage in a form of plagiarism if you ignore where the data comes from, and by the very nature of how the data is obtained, it is impossible for the output to genuinely reach the threshold of being &quot;novel&quot;, despite how original it may appear. Because all the output is derivative.<br/><br/>From a practical stance in society, allowing AI to generate things that are then patented lacks enough benefits to override the very real risk of the potential of patent trolling, the practice of creating loosely patched together ideas for the sake of taking money from people who try inventing new things through frivolous litigations. Copyright isn&#39;t too different in this matter, as there are many examples of people trying to take a word and turn it into the patent equivalent of a &quot;novel&quot; idea. For instance, Tim Langdell notoriously engaged in litigation of any titles in the video game industry by suing for trademark infringement based on the word &quot;edge&quot;. If we were to apply this example to modern day example, it would be like Elon Musk copyrighting the letter &#39;x&#39; and filing litigation against anyone using the 24th letter of the alphabet in any circumstance of online interaction. It lacks any creative merit, and only serves to dissuade creation of new ideas. The costs do not outweigh the risks for artificial intelligence in this regard.<br/><br/>Here&#39;s a mental experiment; if an artificial intelligence had only one person&#39;s information and creations fed into it, would the output of the AI be its creation, or would it be that one person&#39;s? Who would the credit be given to for the output? All the metaphorical puzzle pieces would come from one place, but it would be rearranged by something else. Is something put through a blender new?<br/><br/>In a nutshell, leaving AI unchecked in terms of copyright and patenting is a terrible idea.<br/>
