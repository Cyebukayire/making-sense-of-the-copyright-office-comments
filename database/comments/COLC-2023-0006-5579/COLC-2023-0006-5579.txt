Works created by AI at the moment are basically pirated works mashed together to create something &quot;new&quot;. Though it is entirely possible to recreate original works that the AI was trained on, if a user gives the AI specific instructions to do so. AI models trained on copyrighted data of any kind should not be allowed. Otherwise, there is no point in applying for copyright of one&#39;s own works. AI creates an easily exploitable  loophole in the copyright system if it is allowed to run rampant as it has been. <br/><br/>Ideally, AI models should be sold/distributed as blank slates for individuals or organizations to mold into specialized tools. They can then sell products and services created by their own custom tailored AI model. They could even sell their AI model. Perhsps there should be a way to lock these data sets to prevent any unwanted tampering. These specialized AI models could also be applicable for copyright, not just the works they create. As long as the AI is trained on legally acquired data. <br/>One example could be:  <br/>Disney purchases an AI model. Asks their artists to sign a contract to allow Disney to train their AI model on all art that these artists create for Disney productions in the past, present, and future. The artists who sign the contract would receive compensation of some kind. (Royalties, lump sum payment, monthly/annual deposit)<br/>Disney could then copyright that AI model so only they can use/sell it. They could of course copyright any products and services created by this AI model which was trained on art made by consenting artists. <br/><br/>I believe this is the best way for AI works to become applicable for copyright. Individuals and organizations should be able to purchase or develop their own AI models that they can then build a customized data set for. AI should not be able to scrape data for itself. It must be hand curated. If an individual or organization is found to be guilty of training an AI model on copyrighted data that is not their own, then they should be liable to be sued by the rightful owner(s) and forced to purge the AI model containing copyrighted data. For this to be enforceable, it must be legally required for all datasets of AI models to be viewable by the public. Complete transparency is an absolute necessity in order to uphold copyright law. <br/><br/>That being said, I don&#39;t believe you can copyright your own likeness. I feel it is necessary to point out that even with these strict regulations, someone could legally train an AI model on photos and videos of a person. They could then use this AI model to easily and rapidly create fake images and videos using AI voice synthesis to recreate the victim&#39;s voice. There desperately needs to be laws in place to prevent unconsensual use of a person&#39;s likeness. I&#39;m not just worried about fake AI versions of existing people being created for malicious acts like destroying a person&#39;s reputation. We should be able to sue someone for the very act of creating a fake version of us. Whether it be just image or just voice or both. Replicating a person&#39;s likeness using AI should legally require their consent. A person should not be able to use or monetize someone else&#39;s voice or image without first receiving permission from them. I know this is somewhat extreme, but AI has created a world where a person&#39;s identity can be easily replicated and exploited. Unfortunately, strict regulations are necessary to keep such a powerful tool from being used for nefarious means. It will likely still happen but at least the perpetrators could be forced to pay the price for their wrongdoings. But only if you create the laws and regulations necessary to do so. <br/>
