AI is a massive threat to the writing community, and to the cultural development of the United States. Our nation has for the past century been a world leader in artistic development, particularly in the arts of writing and cinema. By allowed AI to pilfer data and mine written works for stylistic choices and use of language, we risk undoing the artistic development of our nation. Furthermore, by doing so, we undermine our position as an important voice in global cultural development. To allow AI to steal from works written by human authors, we set ourselves on a path that is entirely and assuredly destructive. We must protect human copyright, and we must disallow AI companies from pilfering data created by human artists.
