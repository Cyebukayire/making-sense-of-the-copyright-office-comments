Thanks for seeking public opinion on this, I, and many others appreciate letting our voices be heard. I am opposed to letting AI train on copyrighted works of others, as an artist my living depends on my being able to monetize my work. I also am an supporter of other creator types and believe that in any democratic society it&#39;s important to have said support for the arts.<br/><br/>The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.&nbsp; This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.&nbsp; Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright.<br/><br/>Furthermore, The Copyright Office should have it so finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering these comments.
