I will give a point of view, from a philosophical standpoint regarding AI and copyright. It&#39;s neither right, nor wrong. Just an observation.<br/><br/>Ultimately noone owns anything. Even the author borrowed English language to later write books in English. Every piece of information was learned from someone else. The authors who claim copyright in reference to AI material using their data, should consider they can only enjoy status of authorship because they researched from someone else&#39;s hard work before them. Author may have built upon prior works, but still needed prior works as a template.<br/><br/>Therefore just as authors borrow from others hard work in order to create their praiseworthy works - in the same way AI training data is borrowing authors works to create it&#39;s own works.<br/><br/>For this reason, I don&#39;t see any issue with AI using copyright text to train it&#39;s data.  <br/><br/>SUMMARY: Authors have borrowed from others hard work to become intelligent, famous and enjoy revenue. AI is borrowing from authors hard word. Public users are borrowing from AI servers hard work. So everyone is sharing, learning and benefiting.<br/><br/>I am a teacher of philosophy in Melbourne and would GLADLY allow my content to be used for AI training purposes. In fact, I want it because I know I put my heart and soul into ensuring the content is objective, verified and practical.  It&#39;s in my interest the world benefits from my hard work.  Why would I deny that; its my duty to give back.<br/>
