Since AI needs to be trained on pre-existing material, its owners shouldn&#39;t be able to copyright what it produces. A print-shop doesn&#39;t own the copyright for the posters it prints, even if they are allowed to charge people for the use of their facilities.<br/>If an AI&#39;s owner wants to charge for the use of their program, that&#39;s understandable, but the product of AI is just a recombination of materials that the owner has no claim over.
