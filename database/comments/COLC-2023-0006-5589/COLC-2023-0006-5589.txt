Hello,<br/>For years I uploaded my art to the internet. I wanted to show it to others, connect with other artists and hopefully find clients for illustration and comic work. Without my consent (and no compensation) my art has been used for teaching several AI machines to create artwork. It feels revolting. I worked so hard to gain these skills and then they&#39;re taken by a machine without a word. I have no hope for the future, there&#39;s no way to be a professional artist when AI is stealing your skills and opportunities. People will think the way to get artwork is to type a prompt into a machine instead of supporting a living human that actually pays taxes.<br/>Please stop these developments and demand compensation for every artist that is affected.
