I think it makes sense that Ai generated content does Not qualify for copyright.  It would be far too easy for a single actor to spam the system with mass copyrights of material and by having Ai content not be copyrighted it seems to give the content to society to do with as they choose in a more fair manner. In terms of Ai violating copyright by training on certain data, I also think that is the wrong way of looking at it.  An Ai model when training is basically just reading the content and learning from it is it goes along. Similarly with image models, Ai is just looking at different art for &quot;inspiration.&quot;  This training process does not seem much different than if a person decided to read some classic literature works for inspiration before beginning a book project of their own.  It is also very similar to a person deciding to visit an art gallery to look at art for inspiration before they go to their own canvas and start painting.  In human-like terms, Ai is basically just learning and getting inspiration before creating its new novel works. At least if these works are not allowed to be copyrighted I think they would then be in the public domain for all to use further fulfilling Ai&#39;s role as a potential gift to humanity.
