I am vehemently opposed to AI in creative fields. As a musician and a writer, it&rsquo;s an insult and a threat to the craft, creativity, and humanity that artists put into our work. Copyright should protect work from AI scraping, and AI work should not be copyright-able by the organization that generated it. It undermines the entire point of intellectual property.
