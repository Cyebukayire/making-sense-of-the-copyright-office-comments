AI uses people&#39;s works to generate whatever it spits out, and I don&#39;t think that should be copyrighted. The person who input the prompt did not make the work themselves; it was the machine trained off reading everyone else&#39;s hard work without permission. That does not count as making something copyrightable. <br/><br/>While we&#39;re at it, companies and websites should not be allowed to tell people their creations are going to be used for AI training in the TOS and leave it at that. People need to have an actual choice in whether their works get used to train AI or not.
