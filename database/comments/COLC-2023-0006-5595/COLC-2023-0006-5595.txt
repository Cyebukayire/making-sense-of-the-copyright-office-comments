I am a Master&#39;s student specializing in Human-Technology Interaction at Tampere University, currently working on my thesis about generative AIs. Given the significant influence of U.S. legislation on global AI regulations, I feel compelled to share my perspective on the issues you&#39;ve raised.<br/><br/>1. The Use of Copyrighted Works to Train AI Models:<br/>The crux of this matter lies in understanding the sheer scale of AI training. While there are experts better equipped to delve into the technical specifics of training data sizes and the parameters AI uses to grasp the nuances of language or art, I&#39;d like to offer a broader perspective. The datasets used for training these models are vast, making an individual&#39;s contribution akin to a single drop in an ocean. To draw an analogy, it&#39;s as if someone were to claim exclusive rights to one specific shade out of 16.8 million hex colors. However, even this comparison falls short, as in the realm of AI, we might be dealing with a spectrum that encompasses trillions of such shades.<br/><br/>2. The copyrightability of material generated using AI systems.<br/>The ownership of content produced by AI should primarily reside with the prompt engineer (the individual guiding the AI) or the company that owns the AI, as stipulated in their End User License Agreement (EULA). Determining the threshold of &quot;sufficient effort&quot; by the prompt engineer can be challenging. The degree of control exerted over the generated content varies with different AI models. Hence, the solution should be sought beyond merely assessing the length or complexity of the input.<br/><br/>3. Potential liability for infringing works generated using AI systems<br/>Holding individuals accountable for copyright infringements resulting from AI outputs is impractical. For instance, this could unjustly target minors who might be innocently experimenting with the technology. The onus of responsibility should primarily be on corporations and regulatory bodies. Exceptions could be made in cases where individuals derive significant profit from blatant misuse of AI-generated content or produce harmful or illegal material. Analogously, while owning a car isn&#39;t illegal, using it for malicious purposes is. The same principle should apply to AI: the tool itself isn&#39;t the issue, but its misuse is.<br/><br/>4.  The treatment of generative AI outputs that imitate the identity or style of human artists.<br/>The primary focus of copyright law should be on AI outputs that replicate the unique identity or style of human artists. Technological solutions, such as watermarking systems like the one recently introduced by Google ( https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/30/tech/google-ai-images-watermark/index.html ), might offer a way forward. However, restricting prompts isn&#39;t a viable solution, especially when many names also carry inherent meanings. It&#39;s crucial to approach this with patience and collaborate with leading AI developers to address these challenges. While the principle of fair use should be upheld, legal consequences should only arise when the mimicked content is monetized. Instead of adopting a passive stance, I advocate for proactive collaboration with top AI firms to devise effective solutions.
