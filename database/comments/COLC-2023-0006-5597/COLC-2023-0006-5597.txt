AI is like a child. Using it&#39;s past experiences it guess the next correct word or image based on what should come next. By training AI on copyrighted works there is always the possibility it could make something similar to the copyrighted work, because the AI has heard the words or seen the picture in that formation before. Obviously I am not the copyright expert, but I am pretty sure copyright protects from someone recreating a work. While this might not affect large works who have already had things based on them, it greatly affects smaller scale items, in which people might not realize what it is based on.
