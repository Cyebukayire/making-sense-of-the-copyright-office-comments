AI artwork is soulless and steals the creativity from the artists who actually pour their heart, soul, and tears into a piece. You cannot tell me that you &quot;train&quot; a program on the official artwork of others and then give permission for others to use as if it were your own. The program steals official and unofficial artwork and fanwork to create what is essentially a stolen piece of work. There are many illustrators who are losing their jobs because AI is &quot;doing it better&quot;. Please, I only ask that there be made laws that AI be properly tagged with each creator or piece of work that goes into it, or banned completely from being used. This needs to stop
