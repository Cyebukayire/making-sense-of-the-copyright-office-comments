As an artist myself, I do not agree with the use of other people&#39;s art to train ai models. I believe that it is a massive infringement of copyright and these models should stop being used. This is one of the biggest cases of intellectual art theft we have seen to date and there needs to be laws written to protect the integrity of art as an industry.<br/>This point goes for writing as well. We have already seen countless articles written by chap gpt and other writing algorithms that are complete nonsense and used merely to generate clicks. These do nothing for us as a society and there needs to be a crackdown on this as well, it is also threatening the integrity of writing.
