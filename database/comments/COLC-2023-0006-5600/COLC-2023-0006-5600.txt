&quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; that we have now is a misnomer. It is not &quot;intelligent&quot; or &quot;learning,&quot; it only steals the work of humans, rearranges it, and claims it as its own to make money for other humans. It has no artistic value and is morally bankrupt. It should not be permitted to be copyrighted and all artists, writers, and other humans deserve to be paid damages by the &quot;artifical intelligence&quot; creators for the work they have stolen to &quot;train&quot; completely without consent, and future work it has taken from them by rearranging their own existing creations.
