I don&#39;t want to live in a world where robots create art and humans do the work.  <br/><br/>I am an artist, I am small, I have little to no recognition to my name in any art sphere.  But I&#39;m scared.  I&#39;m scared the thing I love creating the most will be the catylist for someone elses profit without my consent.  I&#39;m scared I&#39;ll lose my future.  I&#39;m scared my life will be stolen from me.
