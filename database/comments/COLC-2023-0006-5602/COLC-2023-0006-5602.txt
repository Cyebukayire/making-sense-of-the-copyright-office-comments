Hello! Current models of A.I. art, such as Midjourney, and written A.I., such as ChatGPT, are in flagrant violation of nearly every single copyright law in existence because they scrape images/text they do not own the rights to and use it to allow noncreatives a way to produce a product to sell based on others work. They quite literally steal from creatives and directly use it to gain money. This approach does not promote useful science and arts, it is designed to take away human expression and place it in the hands of people who do not wish to create and wish to merely produce products. Beyond being, in the vast majority of cases, illegally done, it is also unethical due to the vast amount of artists who create for a living and were not contacted or even acknowledged. Please act to protect the artists of this nation and ban the practice of scraping data (images, text) blindly to steal the work of creatives in order to produce products.
