So called &quot;ai-art&quot; is predatory at best, as it doesn&#39;t actually generate new art so much as it steals from a number of sources (often from uncredited individuals, sometimes with the intention of replicating a single artist&#39;s work so as to replace them entirely) and creates a collage of them. As such, the existence of ai itself is a copyright violation of the art it has stolen, and the work produced by ai should not be able to claim copyright for itself.
