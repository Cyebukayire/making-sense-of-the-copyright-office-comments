Hello, I read an article on theverge.com that you want my expertise and rabbinic advice, so I came to help. The anwer to  how AI models should use copyrighted data in training is that as long as the output is transformative work, it can use the data however it wants. The answer to whether AI-generated material can be copyrighted even without a human involved is no, people will build extremely fast supercomputers in order to generate content at unimaginable rates, for example they would generate a red super hero, a blue one, a green one and so on and automatically copyright them all, now apply this for everything. A human must always be involved in this process or an AI communicating with an AI  that approves the copy copyright would copyright every idea possible and leave humans nothing. We can also argue that humans are obsolete and a machine should not be held back from copyrighting every idea possible that is possible to be generated just because we can&#39;t keep up with it, but my answer is no, AI should not have an automatic the copyright process. Now to the third one, copyright liability would work with AI, this one is tough. If an AI generates an image of Superman and it does so for an entire comic where Superman is the main character and it generates revenue by selling this comic, then it&#39;s creator is liable, if it&#39;s streamed online and not sold, just for entertainment, then it should be ok, if it just uses him once as an easter egg with the S mirrored as parody then it is ok.
