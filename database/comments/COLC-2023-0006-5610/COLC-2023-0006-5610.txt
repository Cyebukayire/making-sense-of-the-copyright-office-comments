Art is something only HUMANS can do. Imagine how boring art will be if everyone will use STOLEN data to do one thing. Ai has pros and cons, but making art is out of the question. Art is used to convey feelings. You know what CANNOT convey feelings? Data. Stop using Ai for inhumane things. There&rsquo;s more problems in the world than this.
