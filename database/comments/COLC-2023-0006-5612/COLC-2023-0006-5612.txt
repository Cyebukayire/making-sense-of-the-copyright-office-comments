I am deeply concerned about the implications of AI for artists, and the ways that corporations will seek to displace humans in favor of machines.  I do not think you should be able to copyright AI art.  I also think that AI should only be trained using images that were uploaded to the database with the express permission of their creator.  Said creators should be compensated in some way, and there should be ways to credit them as well.
