The creativity of individuals must be protected. People must be compensated for their work regardless of that work is creating widgets or creating works of the mind. Copyrighted material and other materials no in the public domain should not be used by AI or other aggregating systems. It is stealing, the same way it would be to appropriate a patented invention. The world would be a sad place without innovation which includes art, writing, and other products of the mind. Artists must be protected and compensated for their work.
