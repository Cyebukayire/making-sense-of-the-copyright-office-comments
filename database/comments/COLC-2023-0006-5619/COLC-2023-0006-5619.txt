AI generative works use human made works to generate the output by scraping websites for data. The human artists and writers are never notified that their work is being used in AI data pools, and many do not know how to protect themselves from AI scraping their online portfolios. While the process of generating an AI image or written work may be initiated by a human, the human made works the AI sources are still gained without prior knowledge or consent, and should be treated as theft and/or a copyright infringement.
