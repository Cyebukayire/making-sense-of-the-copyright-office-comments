AI has many capabilities, and whilst it is useful as a learning tool, the fact of the matter is that its improper use in recent years has caused many Americans distress. I, for one, firmly believe that AI should not be used as anything more than a learning tool, or even for one&#39;s own recreational use. Commercial and for-profit use of AI generated products, more specifically AI generated art and sound, is especially harmful, as it takes bits and samples from others&#39; material without the owner&#39;s consent. In a way, the distribution and/or sale of AI content is akin to piracy. If anything is to be done about AI, it is to be mandated in a way where the public, profitable use of AI generated goods, or the use of one&#39;s style in AI generators without the originators consent, can be punishable by law.
