Artificial Intelligence is not, and cannot be, human intelligence. Copyright was created for real humans, who create for and with other humans. The future of humanity was always promised to be that machines would do work, leaving humans more time for the creation of art. With the current iterations of AI, the vast majority of us are condemned to mindless labor, while the joy of creation is handled by mindless machines -- using as prliminary data OUR works of mind and heart -- for efficiency of profit to be gained by only a tiny fraction of us. <br/>AI does not function unless it is preloaded with enormous amounts of sample data, enough to apply its algorithms successfully. That data consists of the creative and hard-won work of humans. Should we be rendered obsolete by machines using the data we created for other humans? Absolutely we should NOT allow the &quot;training&quot; of AI using works that were not intended for that purpose without the expressed consent of the creator, any more than we should allow plagiarism by other humans. <br/>Further, the use of AI, unless carefully regulated and controlled, may become a source of disinformation and error so pervasive that all intellectual property becomes unusable. How can any data be considered true if it is auto-generated without a function to determine its factuality? At present, humans bear that responsibility themselves, and those disseminating falsehoods, both textual and visual, are subject to at least societal disapproval and at worst fraud and propagandizing. The consequence of error introduced in scientific works could be lethal. <br/>The use of AI should be for the purpose of serving humanity, not supplanting it, and not endangering it. Where it is allowed it should be monitored by humans with prejudice. Under no circumstances should the work of AI be protected by copyright, as that should be held by human creators alone.
