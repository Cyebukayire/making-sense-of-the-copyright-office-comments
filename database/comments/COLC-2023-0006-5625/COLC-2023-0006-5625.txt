I believe Artificial Intelligence should be heavily regulated. AI generation tools and AI training tools infringe upon the rights of individuals and organizations by aggregating existing works (written works, artwork, etc.) without its creators&#39; consent to form new images or writing. It is not fair use. Works that are not created with original human effort should not be granted copyright. Tweaking or editing an AI generated work should not be considered creative effort and should not be granted copyright. Anti-piracy laws and fines should be strictly enforced on the companies responsible for AI generators and other AI tools, since they include copyrighted material in their AI training datasets without permission or going through the correct legal channels to obtain usage rights. <br/><br/>Regulation of AI would protect the rights and livelihoods of actors, singers, writers, and artists. I have many friends in creative fields whose work has been stolen and included in AI training databases without permission, often leading to them losing jobs because companies and individual clients choose to use their stolen AI counterparts instead for free or a cheaper rate. This could lead to a dangerous collapse of multiple industries if left unregulated. AI should not be permitted to use existing works at the expense of the people who made them and own their copyright.
