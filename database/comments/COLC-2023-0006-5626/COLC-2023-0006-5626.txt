I grew up in the days when you prosecuted teenagers for downloading movies, because corporations &quot;intellectual property&quot; was a huge deal and SO important and &quot;you wouldn&#39;t download a car&quot; right? Yet these &quot;AI&quot; companies have been allowed to sweep the entire web of everything &ndash; our casual conversations with friends, our blogs, our FACES, grandparents&#39; holiday photos of their grandchildren &ndash; all of that went into the Big Machines so that they, now, can churn out soulless garbage text and alien looking not-quite-human imagery, based on OUR lives, OUR creativity, OUR words and art. And they have the gall to suggest they get to copyright the output? That they should not be held accountable for all the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY i.e. our thoughts and creativity, that they STOLE?  <br/><br/>Fuck that noise, as the kids today say. <br/><br/>You do not get to collect everything we put on the internet, only to turn around and somehow try to make us pay for it, or worse, take our jobs from us by making us obsolete.  I&#39;m a translator and a copywriter, and if this is allowed to go on I will be out of a job by this time next year. No computer can produce the quality text I can, but in this diseased fucking world, no one is going to notice. Once they have made computer generated garbage the norm, we won&#39;t even remember what good text could look like, how it felt, all the feelings it evoked in us. We will be drowning in mathematically probability generated soulless garbage and we won&#39;t realise we are dying as a species if this is allowed to continue. <br/><br/>Personally, I don&#39;t see the value of creating computers that can write or create art like humans whatsoever &ndash; why make the one thing that makes us uniquely human obsolete? What purpose does it have to take away our human creativity? What is the goal? Personally, I believe the development of LLM/Generative AI art &amp; text should be STOPPED and the creators should apologise and compensate all of humanity for their fucking soulless technical vampire enterprise. <br/><br/>But I will settle for you making sure:<br/>- AI output cannot be copyrighted; <br/>- AI output cannot not be monetized &ndash; no one can make money from unlawfully vaccuuming up all of the Internet!;<br/>- Training data must be OPT-IN (NO MORE SCRAPING);<br/>- An opt-in for training should be easy to OPT OUT of;<br/>- They have to stop putting LLM/Gen AI into places where it doesn&#39;t fucking belong - like search results;<br/><br/>I&#39;m trying to survive as a creative and you let these soulless Silicon Valley tech bros just cut us all off at the ankles, steal our livelihood, ruin our future livelihood and we have no way of claiming compensation!?!<br/><br/>THEY DOWNLOADED ALL OUR CARS AND SOLD THEM FOR PROFIT. Prosecute them and give us our money and our lives back.
