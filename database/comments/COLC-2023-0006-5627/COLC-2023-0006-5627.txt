Calling the process &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; doesn&#39;t do it justice. &quot;Generative slop&quot; (GS) is a much more accurate description of what it does, and will be what I use for the remainder of my comment. Generative slop is, at best, a collage made without human input, and is most often blatant copyright infringment, intellectual property violation, and/or quasi-identity theft of the thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, artists/creatives/voice actors/any person whose work (or voice) was scraped for one of these data sets that GS uses.<br/>If a person stole jewelry, melted it down, and reformed the pieces, the results would be more theirs than what a GS prompter could claim. GS receiving copyright protection is akin to giving a person typing a search into Amazon and blindly purchasing the first thing they find the rights to its copyright. <br/>As of the results of a case between PETA and Wikimedia, the law currently recognizes that only a human can hold copyright over a piece of media. This is the right call, and still more than applicable here. The person prompting the GS is not the &quot;creator,&quot; they are at best an executive director, and more often than not closer to a fast food customer describing their order. The thing doing the &quot;creating&quot; of this piece is not human, it has merely woven a tapestry of (completely unauthorized for its use in the vast majority of cases) many humans&#39; work. None of those humans would benefit from the piece existing, and certainly not from it receiving copyright protection.
