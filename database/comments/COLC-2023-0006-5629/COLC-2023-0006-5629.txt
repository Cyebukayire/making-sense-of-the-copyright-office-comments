Artificial Intelligence machines are not intelligent. They do not have sentience and they do not create. They are data scrapers, plagiarizing obscene amounts of creative work en masse. They are a gross violation of copyright law and intellectual copyright protections and cannot and should not be afforded any protections themselves. And the irony of having to submit multiple CAPTCHAs to prove I am not a robot is not lost on me.
