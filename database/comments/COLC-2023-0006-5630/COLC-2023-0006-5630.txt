If AI exists&mdash;which it will do&mdash;there should at the very least be copyright laws and other protections put in place to protect the humans that the AI models are created to enrich the lives of. Without any protection, humans will simply lose more than they seek to gain from the AI they create.<br/><br/>It makes no sense for profit to be made from AI art when the original creators of the art that was fed into the AI did not give permission their art to be used, nor do they receive any sort of compensation, which means AI art is only exploiting and profiting from the hard work of human artists.<br/><br/>Artists are already being put of jobs and replaced by AI tools&mdash;AI tools that were made by feeding the artists&rsquo; work into. If this continues, there will a flood of artists who are put out of jobs. It won&rsquo;t end there. When the hard work of humans is exploited for the benefit of others, is that not something that should be illegal? Are we uncivilized? Should we punish those who abide by the laws and work hard through their lives? Is exploiting and harming others ethical?<br/><br/>Today it&rsquo;s artists. Who&rsquo;s next?<br/>
