By eliminating the ability of others to create, you nullify the worth of your own existence by eliminating the worth of anything you could ever do. Advancements in technology should push people to go further, not replace what we are already capable of doing. Technology has more power and influence in pushing humanity forward by simplifying difficult processes. However, to take away the enjoyment and worth of entertainment and art will only serve to dissuade people to live their lives more freely. It discourages one of the major factors of human life, which is rest and creation of art. By singling out a particular aspect of life, you ruin the ecosystem it was intended to thrive in. Instead of stability in a delicate balance of human rest, work, and play, it will result in a weakened system of solely work and doesn&#39;t have as much support as when there is a balance. AI art threatens that balance by discouraging people to make their own art. It discourages them from creating anything, should AI spread to different sectors. When used incorrectly, it&#39;s a threat to human advancement and innovation itself, because people are no longer encouraged to improve in their own respective fields. Art may not be a priority in this society, but innovation can only work through the collaboration of human experience and creation, whether that is from art or design or entertainment.
