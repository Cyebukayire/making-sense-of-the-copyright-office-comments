I believe that the technologies labelled as &quot;AI&quot; are extremely unregulated, immoral, and do not respect the integrity of nearly anyone involved in the process. I am a digital illustrator that has to live in fear of someone re-using my art and claiming it as their own, or being replaced with a cheap knockoff artist that uses &quot;AI art&quot;.
