As an artist and a writer with copyrights and creative material in the Library of Congress, I never want AI pretending to be me or &quot;stealing&quot; by work for sale or freedom to do whatever.  There must be instituted ASAP a &quot;Set of Laws&quot; with fines and extensive penalties for &quot;Anyone or Any Corporate Body&quot; who absolutely believes that &quot;Everything in the world is theirs for the taking&quot;. AI is not an entity where &quot;Imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery&quot; when used by AI Pirates.
