I can see how it&rsquo;s bad and good, new tech always gets a bad rap at first. (Photography certainly did when the pictures started getting good.) I think it&rsquo;s important to note that art has always been a hobby of mine, and I&rsquo;m happy that Ai is expanding the field. Purely from a personal perspective, I love the idea that art I find to take way too long to complete and vastly too expensive to produce or commission- can be widely utilized by anyone regardless of talent. They can express what they would like to see in the world and see it in a manner or minutes, I see this as a massive positive considering how much time and effort would be spent on it if they were to decide to figure out how to paint or draw it themselves. <br/><br/>For me and many others art has always been an expression of one&rsquo;s self so I get why professionally paid artists would be upset with an engineer utilizing their work for less expensive means. If you spent hundreds of hours on a style of art and an ai learns it in tens of hours and only takes a couple minutes to produce a new original- I can see where that actually limits the market. (Qed many song&rsquo;s sounding samey these days because every song has probably already been written and posted.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with creating ai art as a hobby to show friends and family or to keep for oneself- but placing it on the internet and telling everyone it&rsquo;s your original work should be stopped if the ai is simply recreating off of someone&rsquo;s personal style. Now if it&rsquo;s being displayed as ai art instead, I see that as progress and honestly and dedication to seeing one&rsquo;s hobbies flourish and spread&hellip; But- there really should be code in every picture that isn&rsquo;t croppable so everyone can tell it was ai generated as it can be difficult to tell these days. If I could suggest one non-invasive way to regulate this- that would be it. &ldquo;If you post ai art it should be built into the photo somewhere that it was an ai that created it.&rdquo; After that you can addendum which bot created it and whose styles it was inspired by. <br/><br/>Just one more take: ai training is a computerized way of saying a piece is inspired by ______ and artists both visual and audible have taken from previous artists since the start of recorded art. I get that ai is faster but in my opinion that&rsquo;s how we get better quality artists to compose better quality art. It also took a fair bit of effort on the engineering side to create a bot that could understand and utilize all that content, and I think that&rsquo;s art too. Just because it&rsquo;s fast doesn&rsquo;t mean we should be scared of it- it means more art in a short human lifespan and that makes me extremely happy.
