We need something in place to regulate how these companies their data sets to train their AI.  Right now there are no protections in place to protect people from having their voice, likeness, art, etc referenced and used without compensation or consent. <br/>I am a voice actor.  If someone wants to license my voice in any capacity, I should be compensated for its use.  <br/>Also, people are being automatically &quot;Opted in&quot; (on certain services such as Meta and Adobe) to allow third parities to use personal information to train AI models.  This practice needs to be stopped.  It is unethical.  <br/>
