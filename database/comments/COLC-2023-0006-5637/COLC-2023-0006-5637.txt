Hello, I am someone who is fresh out of college and looking for employment within the creative industry involving sound design and music production and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. I got my degree in this field and I&rsquo;m concerned I&rsquo;ll never get to enter it because of unregulated AI. I am concerned as well for my friends who are artists, who&rsquo;s work is being stolen and abused by AI scraping online and are being discouraged from their hobbies and careers by people who do not wish to put in the work.
