The so-called &quot;AI art&quot; trend is nothing but a scam perpetrated by thieves who would rather steal and apologize later than simply pay for the service they want. This is not conducive to a healthy art and design industry nor a healthy society. Creators and their intellectual property must be protected from thieves who would take from their pockets merely to profit from their labor.
