In the current situation of how the laws are laid out, artificial intelligence falls in a very grey area which needs to be filled. It is a powerful and very useful tool, however it&#39;s usage is unethical and in some cases outright stealing or piracy as its use is to mimic the data fed to it. <br/><br/>It is trending among businesses as a far, far cheaper alternative to hiring actual creative people to fill the roles. This will directly impact the economy negatively as unemployment rises amongst the creative fields. It threatens the livelihoods of thousands as businesses opt to hire less and less employees to do what they believe artificial intelligence can do. <br/><br/>Our likeness is also at stake when confronted with artificial intelligence as with even a small amount of data fed to it, it can copy and generate a person&#39;s creative style, image and even our voices. A small amount of public data could allow someone to generate an infinite amount of content against the user&#39;s will. As artificial intelligence improves, this will become life threatening through numerous ways when the model is capable of generating just about anything coming from them. Their face, their voice and potentially even their own personality could be mimicked. As of right now, it is most commonly used to generate artwork and voices.<br/><br/>This is not all to say that artificial intelligence should be banned across the globe as there are good applications as well. In the same light of mimicking data fed to it, this allows for the user of the model to cut down work time and workload exponentially. It has been improving our everyday usage of the internet for years now. These are just a couple of things which directly and positively impact a common user such as myself. <br/><br/>Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool which has been directly and indirectly improving the lives of most, however there need to be regulations put in place as it becomes more common and is placed in the hands of the public.<br/><br/>Consent must be required from all parties before data is to be fed to any models. This should be separately opted in beyond any terms of service in the advent where one party no longer wishes to provide data. Should they reject, all data relating to them that has been stored should be deleted and no more shall be gathered for use. Data used must be able to be traced back to its original found source. All things generated by artificial intelligence must be marked as such within the data. Copyright laws should apply to generation by artificial intelligence to allow parties affected to defend their intellectual property.
