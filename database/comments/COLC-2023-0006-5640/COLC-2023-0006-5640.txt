I believe AI should not be copyrightable, especially so if the data that was used for training was taken without consent. AI poses a real danger to those building a brand or public image of any kind, as AI can be used without their consent to make it appear as if they have said, done, drawn, or written things they have not. There is a lack of transformative creation or parody when AI is used in this way as the machine&#39;s goal is to completely replicate whatever has been fed into it and lacks the human flaws and intent that would cue one into a parody or transformative work. Instead AI used in this way becomes a form of theft, taking in copyrighted work from creators without their consent or permission and essentially stealing their brand and ideas. <br/><br/>Since there are currently no regulations in place concerning AI it is difficult to figure out whether or not the model has been trained on stolen data, therefore no AI works should be copyrightable. AI is a form of machine learning and algorithm, it cannot create ideas in the same way a human being would and it instead generates works entirely reliant on the data inputed into it. AI works are not inherently creations or intelectual property because the machine does not utilize human thought when generating works, and unless all creators that were used as data for the algorithm are included within the copyright for the use of their intellectual property it would be disingenuous for only the prompter for the AI to claim rights over the work as if it were their own. Typing a prompt is not the same as creating the work itself.
