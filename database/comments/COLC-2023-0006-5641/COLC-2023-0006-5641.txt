The majority of AI programs are trained on &#39;scraped&#39; content without the original copyright-holding party&#39;s approval and the end result of that is copyright infringement in-and-of-itself. Unless you can prove that what content an AI is &#39;trained&#39; on is in public domain or authorized for use by the original creator you can&#39;t possibly copyright the results. Regardless, even if the AI isn&#39;t committing copyright theft, it still isn&#39;t original intellectual property. Calling these programs &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is inaccurate; they do not have intellect, therefore they cannot have intellectual property.
