Generative &quot;AI&quot; is both theft and a misnomer. Let me explain:<br/><br/>&quot;AI&quot; stands for artificial intelligence, and the only accurate part of that name is &quot;artificial.&quot; Generative AI is a machine learning algorithm that takes original work, processes it, and often spits it out with minor or no modifications. In academia, this is known as plagiarism, and has harsh penalties. <br/><br/>Machine learning algorithms work by being fed tons of content that guides it to produce what the maker wants, and does not constitute original work in any way. It actively threatens the livelihoods of creatives everywhere, from artists to writers and beyond.<br/><br/>The makers of generative AIs have found ways to apply this form of theft beyond the written word, and now use it to steal likenesses, art, and voices, which is a major point in the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes that have been ongoing for the bulk of this year. The only input from a human being that goes into &quot;creation&quot; by a generative AI is a single word or phrase, which by itself does not produce anything that could be considered copyrighted.<br/><br/>I urge the Copyright Office to consider the use of generative AI as infringement of copyright for any material used to train it regardless of active copyright, and especially if that material has copyright to someone who is not the maker of the generative AI, and to never grant copyright to any work identified as created by generative AI in any form.
