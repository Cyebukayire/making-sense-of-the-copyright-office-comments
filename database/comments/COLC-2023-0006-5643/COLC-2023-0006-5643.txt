Hi,<br/><br/>I am concerned about the current rise and usage of AI. I am an archaeologist, and as part of my career and continuing research, I am worried that AI will be used more and more to push people out of work. In my job in cultural resource management, I fear that AI would be used to help greenlight environmentally damaging and culturally insensitive construction work and harm the progress we have achieved as a scientific discipline. I am also worried that it would allow a sharp rise in misinformation and cheating in academia and daily life. I have seen the results provided by some AI chat software, and the blateness with which it give not only gives incorrect but downright horrible answers to simple questions has me worried that people will no longer trust each other, sending our society down the rabbit hole further of polarization, hatred and vitriol. I implore you to take heed to the words that I have said, for if AI is allow to continue on its current trajectory, I forsee a future where only the wealthy and powerful can achieve anything, while those of us who are not born to wealth will languish in squalor, begging for work, not seen since the Great Depression in the 1930&#39;s.<br/><br/>Sincerley,<br/><br/>A Very Concerned Citizen
