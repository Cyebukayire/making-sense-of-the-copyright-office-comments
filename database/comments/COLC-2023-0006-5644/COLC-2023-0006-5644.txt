Copyrights are intended to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts.&quot; Literature is one of the most useful of arts; it communicates histories and stories that express our very humanity. AI is trained through human labor and love. Writing anything takes dedication, and writing stories or essays showcases that person&#39;s thoughts and style. As AI trims and pieces and shuffles them with others to produce a different work, it creates pale imitations of actual art. It removes the human part of creation and will influence consumers, who may have been creators or inventors themselves. When AI is trained and producing, human ambition deteriorates.
