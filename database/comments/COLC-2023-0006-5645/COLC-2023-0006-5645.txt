AI art and writing is plagiarism on account of it being generated by feeding the AI with actual art and writing without the creators&rsquo; permission or knowledge, and thus a threat to the economy by putting writers and artists out of work. It&rsquo;s also been used to generate fake audio and video of nonconsenting actors, musicians, and even politicians, which is potentially career ruining if someone takes it in a particularly malicious direction and spreads it to the wrong people. It has been used to generate nude images and videos of nonconsenting and uninformed women, some underage, which can potentially risk jobs and livelihoods as well as being a form of sex crime. It can also act as a source of misinformation very easily, by generating false answers to questions, creating fake images and audio clips and even entirely generated research papers with no actual basis in science or medicine. This is potentially dangerous especially if someone attempts to use false images and video/audio or generated articles as proof of conspiracy in order to incite violence, or to convince others that doing dangerous activities like undergoing dangerous and not actually tested medical treatments. There are no ethics reviews, no real limitations on content that can be created, and no oversight of a technology created and made available for public use, and it has already caused a significant amount of harm and disruption to some people&rsquo;s lives.
