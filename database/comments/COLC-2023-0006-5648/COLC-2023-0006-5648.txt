Copyright law was designed to protect the intellectual property of human beings and to promote creativity in a society. Artificial intelligence not only breaks copyright laws by scrubbing copyrighted content to &quot;learn&quot; from, but what AI produces cannot and should not be copyrightable because it&#39;s a form of plagiarism and it is not a creative endeavor from a human. There is no human to be protected.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
