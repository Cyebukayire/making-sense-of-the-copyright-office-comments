AI &#39;art&#39; and &#39;writing&#39; cannot hold their own copyright. This is like saying that an Excel program should hold a copyright over a formula someone used in it. Generative AI is a program reliant upon violating the copyright of other artists both in training and in production. When creating training manuals companies often buy stock photos or find free-use photos to use in their materials, AI should do the same. Also given that AI projects like Midjourney AI require people to pay for their services (therefore receiving profit for using copyrightable works without permission). And if AI cannot work by paying artists and using free-use work, then they have created a fundamentally bad product.
