AI cannot and should not be copyrighted because, by its very nature, it relies on stolen work to produce content. It violates the copyright of original artists in order to produce something that can&#39;t truly be original; and it can&#39;t be argued that the content it produces is &quot;inspired by&quot; because it takes the literal, physical words or literal art strokes of a content creature rather than producing something new. It&#39;s my sincere belief that profiting off any kind of AI work should remain impossible to copyright, if not outright illegal.
