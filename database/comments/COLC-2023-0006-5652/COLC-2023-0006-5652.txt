I don&#39;t think you should be able to copyright something generated by AI, AI is only taking original media and smashing it all together so it can, in no way, be original. Furthermore, I think there should be regulations on what can be used to help an AI learn and that should require consent from the sources they are trying to use to teach an AI.
