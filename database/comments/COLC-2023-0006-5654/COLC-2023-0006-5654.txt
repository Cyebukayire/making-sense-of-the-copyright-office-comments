AI has ruined writing. Not only are the products produced by AI lacking in a human touch, they&#39;re also taking jobs away from human beings because companies don&#39;t want to pay for something of good quality when they can get a subpar version for free or little cost. Even for those of us with writing jobs, AI is still negatively impacting it. AI plagerism filters are falsely indicating plagiarized content on 100% original pieces and don&#39;t have the human knowledge and ability to analyze each situation on a case by case basis. Somebody referencing a song lyrics isn&#39;t plagiarism but the AI detector will still flag it as such. Not to mention that AI uses other pieces to learn and copy without the writer or artist&#39;s consent. The people using these AIs are then able to produce similar content for profit without the original artist or writer being credited or paid. As a writer myself, I&#39;ve seen a sharp decline in writing gigs available as many of them have been taken over by AI. Additionally, those that are available are few and far between and have unrealistic expectations of a human writer due to the standards set by AI. They expect a final copy of a ~1000 word article in three days without considering the level of work that needs to go into that and the fact that we have other clients and a life outside of work.
