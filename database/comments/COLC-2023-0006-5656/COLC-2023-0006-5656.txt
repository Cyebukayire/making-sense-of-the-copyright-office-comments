As a person who has worked independently in the arts for last ten years or so, and the daughter of a man who has made his living working as an artist and a writer for the last fifty years, I have very strong opinions about AI art. AI art--both written and visual--is a slap in the face to real creators. It is produced via plagiarism of other, human-made works, often without the permission of their creators. The idea that the &quot;creators&quot; of these AI pieces (the humans who own the machines that actually made the art) want to copyright the work produced is laughable. They did not make this art themselves. The machine created the work, and the machine could not have created the work without first sampling hundreds of other pieces, copyrighted pieces themselves, made by actual humans. The work produced is nothing more than a soulless amalgamation of other people&#39;s art, cobbled together by a robot. It cannot be copyrighted. It is, in and of itself, a copyright violation.
