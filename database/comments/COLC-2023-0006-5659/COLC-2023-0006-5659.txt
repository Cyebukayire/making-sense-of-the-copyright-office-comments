Art of all kinds deserve to be protected due to the effort, time, and passion invested in the project. AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; has no passion, no time, and certainly no effort put into it, instead opting to steal parts of other people&rsquo;s works and mashing them together in a cobbled, Frankenstein-like mess that&rsquo;s barely comprehensible. AI is attempting to replace real people who&rsquo;ve spent years honing their skills in their respective craft. As an artist myself, I fear sharing my works because of the risk of them being stolen by AI algorithms.
