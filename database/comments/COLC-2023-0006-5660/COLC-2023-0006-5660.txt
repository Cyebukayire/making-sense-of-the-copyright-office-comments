Despite the name, AI is not artificial intelligence. It cannot create by itself. It must &quot;learn&quot; and be trained by farming works that already exist. Since original authors/creators are not asked permission nor compensated for this, AI models are built on theft and plagiarism. AI works also don&#39;t merit rights or protections since, again, the software is not true independent intelligence, but merely manipulates copyrighted works into its own form. This does not fall under the fair use of transformative works because there is no active engagement with the source material that those are built on, only an automated regurgitation.
