I am concerned about AI remaining unregulated as an author. My published work on archiveofourown has been scraped without my permission, training AI models to replace my work. AI models using my work as part of their base knowledge are doing so without my consent and without my endorsement which if done by any human, would be called plagiarism and/or be a violation of copyright, but since the perpetrator is AI, it&rsquo;s nothing? Machines should not be given more free reign than human beings.
