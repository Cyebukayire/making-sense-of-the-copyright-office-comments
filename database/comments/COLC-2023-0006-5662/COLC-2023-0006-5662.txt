AI art and productions should not be covered by copyright law unless the AI and all references used are either CC0 free content or owned by the publisher of the work. In cases where ownership of content used to train or be used by the AI is unclear, copyright law should not protect the work. A purpose of copyright to begin with is to ensure parties have ownership of their own intellectual property, and contributions are made when their work is used by others. Allowing AI generated content to have the same rights as content created by an individual without reservations violates this entirely. Speaking personally as a writer and an artist, the idea that someone could use something I have poured my labor, time, and education into for their own profit, without my consent, is horrifying and demoralizing. It fundamentally violates my rights as a creator.
