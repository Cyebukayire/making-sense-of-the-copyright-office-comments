Current copyright guidelines fail to account for the level of skill involved in prompting to create truly unique/excellent writing. While I would argue that this is more the case for writing than for generative images, I do think both can require far more of a creative/individual process than is currently accounted for. It would be next to impossible for me to disentangle my contribution from the large language model when creating text. I would in no way want to copyright my prompts, however. Rather, the output from my iterative process of shaping/steering the model, which includes selection, editing (in the form of feedback), etc.
