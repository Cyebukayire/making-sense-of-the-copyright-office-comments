As a writer, this growing insistence for AI use is concerning to me. Not only does it steal content from struggling creatives, but it often does so without their knowledge or consent. It&rsquo;s completely disrespectful to the passion and hard work these people put into their projects. I recognize my opinion isn&rsquo;t likely to change anyone&rsquo;s opinion on AI, but it should be disbanded or heavily limited.
