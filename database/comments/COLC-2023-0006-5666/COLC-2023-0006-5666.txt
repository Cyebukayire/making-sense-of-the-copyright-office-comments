I am a software engineer, and I work for a company that is considering use cases for AI in their products.  I am really uncomfortable with the implications of this technology, and the way the industry has repeatedly abused the rights of artists and authors to generate what amounts to randomized rubbish.  There is no creative expression in AI, and there cannot be.
