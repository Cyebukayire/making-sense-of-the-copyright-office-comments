Hello, I&rsquo;m a member of The Animation Guild (IATSE local 839) and the issue of AI has come up numerous times in our profession the last few years. It&rsquo;s no secret that AI generators such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney are trained on art scraped off the internet without permission from the artists. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a stretch to say that we are incredibly anxious about what employers will do to try and cut workers out of their pipelines. Marvel has already done this with their latest &ldquo;Secret Invasion,&rdquo; where the entire opening is AI generated. What AI could do to industries that rely on the skilled hand of artists is absolutely devastating. <br/><br/>Not only is AI generative art deliberate THEIFT of our work (considering that these models are trained with assets used without permission), AI is also inherently anti-worker. Companies will attempt to wipe out entire crews and replace them with a single AI technician. We already suffer with outsourcing, AI would be the next step to eliminating human creativity entirely. <br/><br/>Please please PLEASE consider what this will do to to creative fields like animation, film, graphic design, illustration, video games, book covers, interior design, car design, and just about every other skilled craft you can think of. Everything in your lives is made and fueled by artists, from the furniture you buy, to the clothes you wear, to the movies you watched as a kid and your children enjoy. Allowing AI to hold a copyright or patent or trademark will spell the end of all the things that make these fields special. <br/><br/>I fear for the future of my job, the future of my craft, and for the livelihoods of my fellow professionals. Please consider taking harsh actions against AI. It would do a lot to quell our fears in a time where so much is already scary and unstable. <br/><br/>Thank you.
