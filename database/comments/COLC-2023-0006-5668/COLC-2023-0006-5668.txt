Artificial intelligence has the ability to provide many useful services in medicine and scientific discover because of how it filters and predicts information. However, artificial intelligence is formed on a base level of information and data points which can manufacture biases and in creative fields lead to theft. Artists whose work is used to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; the program are not credited for the images the AI learns from or the subsequent art produced by the program, even though their work is what the AI based its final product off of. Using AI to create human models also results in the theft of from the humans whose images were used as data points. We need better protection to prevent AI systems from hurting small creators.
