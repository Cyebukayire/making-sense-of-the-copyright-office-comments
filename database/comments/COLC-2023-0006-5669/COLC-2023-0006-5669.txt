I am a college graduate with a Bachelors in history. I know what happens when companies get out of hand, and are allowed to dictate policy. They will hurt the workers, and get rid of them every chance they get. AI generated art must not be copyrighted, as it is not true art. It was duct-taped together from art made by real people, without permission, and with the purpose of profit. This does not fall under free use. It alienates artists from their work, and takes their artistry away from them. It is despicable to allow it to be copyrighted.
