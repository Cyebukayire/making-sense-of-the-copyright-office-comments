Right now, you are likely being bombarded with strangely-written comments extolling the virtues of generative AI, exhorting you to permit copyright to works generated through Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, ChatGPT, and other similar text-prompted content generation software. In all probability, you are seeing tens of thousands more comments supporting copyright for generative AI than you are seeing those opposing it. My hope is that this circumstance itself will highlight to you the dangers inherent in allowing a deluge of sludge to overwhelm our culture and society. The federal government did not take sufficient steps to regulate the internet when it emerged into popular use, and for all its touted benefits, it is plain to see that it has resulted in a staggering number of social issues which are virtually impossible to solve, and every passing day they are only made worse. This is your one chance, perhaps your only chance, to nip this in the bud.<br/><br/>Generative machine-learning technology is made possible only through the wholesale scraping of the internet for every image and piece of text it can lay its hands on. By masquerading as &quot;research institutions&quot;, multibillion dollar corportations like Stability AI, OpenAI, and longtime powerhouses such as Microsoft and Google, are able to utilize the copyrighted works of millions of hardworking artists who do not have the financial ability to defend themselves against the theft of their works. This &quot;research&quot; was and continues to be done without the permission of the artists whose work was used, and is then given to a for-profit company who has the explicit intent of using that training data to make unbelievable amounts of money.<br/><br/>To this point, Stability AI, makers of image-generation software Stable Diffusion, are quite aware of the extremely unethical issues surrounding using copyrighted materials to train their for-profit product, actually made a music-generation model called Dance Diffusion, using only public domain works. They did this because they know that using the works of living artists to create a software which puts them out of business is quite illegal, and the music industry has an extremely adept and ferocious legal arm which could utterly demolish even a large tech company such as Stability AI. Illustrators do not have this. We are a community of students, educators, and lovers of art who tend to have to work day jobs just to pursue our dream of making a living through art. We are not lawyers, nor do we have the collective or financial power to deploy legal teams at will.<br/><br/>We cannot un-make this software, but at the very least, we can do the sane thing: tell these companies that, if you want to use the cultural heritage of humanity and the works of millions of hardworking illustrators without compensation or credit -- by DESIGN without compensation or credit -- then no one who uses their software deserves copyright either. It is unfortunate that they would create a software which allows untold numbers of lazy charlatans to masquerade as competent writers and artists. To allow them to hold copyright over the stolen heritage of humanity is a crime. These companies are lying to you. As you probably expect, they always are. They make a research company to legally steal literally billions of images, and then use that company to power their for-profit software. They say that their software doesn&#39;t directly steal or contain images, and then it literally makes nearly-exact copies of famous works. They say that it allows humans to express themselves deeply, and yet the average text prompt is 13 words. The only thing they say that is true is this: their software is useless without stealing art from the very people they are trying to put out of business. They say that we can opt-out (we can&#39;t), but why isn&#39;t that the default choice? I accept a student learning off of my illustrations because it&#39;s hard, and I appreciate their efforts to go on the same journey to mastery that I have. I reject Midjourney using my images to &quot;learn&quot; because it turns art into &quot;content&quot;.<br/><br/>Future generations will be functionally illiterate. What will be the point of learning to write if you can just speak words into a machine and it will tell you how you feel? Future generations will not know how to paint. What will be the point of learning to paint if you can speak a few words into a machine and it will tell you what is in your head? We are in extremely dangerous territory here. This is not something to be taken lightly. I beg you: do not be fooled by these ill-intended cretins who seek a future where no human is involved in a creative act ever again. I am an art teacher, and I dread the day where I ask a student to pick up a pencil, and they say &quot;What&#39;s the point of learning to draw?&quot; <br/><br/>Below, I&#39;ve attached an essay written by a prominent illustrator, Steven Zapata, which lays out an extremely cogent argument against generative AI. Please, I implore you, read it, and heed it.
