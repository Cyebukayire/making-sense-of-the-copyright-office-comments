Hello,<br/><br/>I appreciate the Office&#39;s concern with this issue and the request for public feedback. I am a college student majoring in English with several published creative works, so this issue is of personal interest to me.<br/><br/>The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works. This allows the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work. Applying this system to generative AI is fair; generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright.<br/><br/>While I believe there are useful applications of generative AI, training the AI on copyrighted works without knowledge, consent, or compensation is unethical and in violation of the copyrights held by the works&#39; original creators. The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the original authors.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration of these comments.
