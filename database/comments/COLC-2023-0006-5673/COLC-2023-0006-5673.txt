AI (and it&#39;s creators) taking things without consent of the creators who made the things (such as artists and writers online. even researchers and regular people who just post tweets) is theft and morally wrong. It would be nice if there was a law to prevent that as right now there isn&#39;t consequences for anything because AI is so new.
