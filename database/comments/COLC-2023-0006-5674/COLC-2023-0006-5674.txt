Four questions were asked, regarding statistical/neural-net generative art (&quot;AI Art&quot;).  As someone affected by the topic, though not to the degree others are, I still wish to provide my own input.<br/><br/>On the topic of copyrighted works being used to train these generators, I do not believe this should, or does, constitute copyright infringement.  Certainly, there is a significant group of people overly emotionally motivated, with severe terms like &quot;Theft&quot; being thrown around, and I fear that an emotional knee-jerk reaction in the lines of their reaction will do more harm than good for society, especially with regards to knock-on effects of any copyright ruling.,<br/><br/>While infringement *may* be involved in the accumulation of the corpus of works used, this infringement would be on the part of the entity providing a download of the copyrighted work, not on the part of the entity receiving this copy over the internet.<br/><br/>Further, simply processing the copyrighted works to produce new transformative work is also neither copyright infringement nor &quot;theft&quot;.  Perfect 10 v Google supports this, as well as a comparison to the google ngrams database.  Google scanned many, many books and other works, and part of their analysis involved creating a database of english words, and chains of words, to determine how often they appear in literature including over time. This was published as a model making this statistical information available.<br/><br/>&quot;AI Art&quot; generators are statistical databases.  They do not store any copyrighted works, but instead only statistics about image components; pixel values based on word associations as well as pixel structure around them.  At no point is copyrighted information stored in the model/database, though it is possible to prompt a model with enough keywords that it may produce an image similar enough to any existing image to fool a human viewer.  This is not evidence of copyright infringement on the part of the model, merely that the prompter and operator of the model is attempting to duplicate works using it.<br/><br/>On the topic of &quot;AI Art&quot; output copyrightability, I believe precedent has already been well set judicially, and just needs this precedent passed forward.  &quot;AI&quot; content; writing, audio, visual stills or sequence (videos) content should not be copyrighted unless the output of the model has been substantially humanly altered afterwards.  Authorship and intent should be required from a sapient artist, not a statistical model.<br/><br/>To touch on copyright, when a model produces output similar to another work then it becomes necessary to determine how that happened.  Mere similarity should not be considered a copyright violation.  Instead, I believe fair use guidelines already provide some guidance.  If the work is being used commercially to compete in the same market as the substantially similar work, and its generation occurs after the creation of the competing / accusing work, then copyright may very well be infringing.<br/><br/>Certainly another topic brought up is &quot;art style&quot; and infringement upon that.  Per what I believe is existing precedent, &quot;Art Style&quot; is not, and should not, be copyrightable in any way.<br/><br/>Lastly, AI likenesses including appearance, voice, etc. are a thorny topic.  I believe this should be treated again taking some guidance from Fair Use rules: Is the use of a likeness competing against a person (or their estate), by which the use of the AI model is offsetting hiring the person or paying licensing for the use of their likeness?  Is it being used in a parody setting?  Certainly the former should be disallowed, while the latter should be more permissible.  Likewise, legal issues such as defamation or slander/libel may arise if an AI likeness is used to harm the reputation of any person.
