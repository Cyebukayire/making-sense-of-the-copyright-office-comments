AI should never be allowed to be copyrighted, and in most cases, the services themselves should be HEAVILY fined and banned as they are fed copyrighted works. Just as the companies creating this bogus software should be treated like the thieves they are, so to should the websites that attempt to make a profit or otherwise use submissions to feed AI. I&rsquo;m specifically referring to deviantart.com and others. For example, deviantart decided that every piece on their website was going to go to feed their AI generator, and you&rsquo;d have to opt OUT to stop it! It was repealed after community bscklash but the fact they even tried is appalling. This is CRIMINAL. Literally. There are artists who work in the industry uploading work they did for various companies. There are artists that have passed away since posting. It&rsquo;s just so disgusting that work can be taken to feed AI and people think they deserve a copyright. <br/><br/>I&rsquo;m BEGGING congress to defend human and creative integrity and protect Americans. Make companies that choose to use AI publicly disclose that they do and how it is used, and require that an artist give contractual, paid, informed consent for their work to be used to feed AI.
