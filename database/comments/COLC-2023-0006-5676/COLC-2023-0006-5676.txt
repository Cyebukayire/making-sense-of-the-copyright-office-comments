I am an actor who survives off providing voiceover services (ie: narration, character voices) to projects in a variety of mediums. Today, both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA guild unions are protesting against multi-billion dollar studios in part for AI-protections. If we were to allow purely AI-generated content to be copyrightable, studios would immediately take that public faith and throw it back into the hundreds of actors, writers, and artists that produce their shows, allowing the art of these professions to become less art, and more 9-5 corporate jobs. I am not against AI use entirely, but the use of AI should be beneficial for the human, and not purely for the wallets of a select few. Studios have already tried including sneaky clauses to allow for AI-generations of their freelancers, due to the lack of laws around AI copyright. Please do not let the studio lobby influence this decision. Stand with the people who have made the US a content hub, and a place to dream and make dreams, instead of the studio heads who only make decisions for them and their shareholders.
