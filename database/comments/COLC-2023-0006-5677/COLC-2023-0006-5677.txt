It&#39;s absolutely buck wild that people are acting like it&#39;s alright to scrape the work of other people who didn&#39;t agree to having their work scraped, have a machine use fancy pattern matching on it, and spit it out and call it their own. It&#39;s literally made from other people&#39;s work. It couldn&#39;t exist without combining the work of others. Machine learning isn&#39;t seeing a bunch of references and being inspired and creating its own thing. It&#39;s using creators&#39; actual content for everything. If I can&#39;t walk into a bookstore and cut out half the pages in ten different books, bind them together, and call it mine, then copyrighting AI stuff shouldn&#39;t be a thing. It&#39;s not those people&#39;s work. No one gave them permission to use it, so why should they get to call it their own and profit from it?
