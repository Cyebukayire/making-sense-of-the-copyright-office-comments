As a human who creates art for a living, I ask the US Copyright Office to reject the idea that machine learning algorithms are capable of creating works of art that deserve to be protected. The work they use to train these systems is mostly the work of artists who are neither asked permission nor credited in the final product. AI generated images are already in competition with human artists in the marketplace, granting them copyright will only further harm people creating real works of value and meaning. Thank you for your consideration.
