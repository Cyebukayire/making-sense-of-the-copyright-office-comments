Artificial Art is just that. It&#39;s artificial, it lacks any soul, skill, or passion. To have people use this and profit when there are people who are practicing their crafts every day. We have people out here going to school, getting an education, and doing their best. It&#39;s not okay for some random person who learned how to code which takes significantly less time can just scrape people&#39;s hard work and have a machine produce illustrations and beautiful works without any real dedication. That&#39;s just on traditional and digital art. <br/><br/>The same reasoning goes for voices. Voices of those living and gone being used to say whatever some user wishes is dangerous and awful. We are supposed to be a country for the people and by PEOPLE. There are people who need accommodations and they should be taken care of, but those who are producing works such as art and music should have some right and privacy of the skills and products they put out for themselves, their companies, and consumers. <br/><br/>What would be the use in funding anything for the arts if some computer can do it? Technology is meant to enhance and help...Not to replace when there are HARD working and TALENTED people who deserve to showcase their skills and not live in fear of being replaced by people who legitimately don&#39;t want to work for it. <br/><br/>Give voices to the people who need it. Help artists with their workloads. Use this technology to learn! Do NOT use it to steal, copy, and destroy.
