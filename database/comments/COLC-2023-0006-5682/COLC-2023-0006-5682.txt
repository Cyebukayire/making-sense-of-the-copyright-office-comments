Generative Ai, and the companies behind these tools have scraped 5.8 Billion Data/Image pairs under the pretense of research and have Data Laundered this to 3rd party companies that make a profit off of Copyrighted works. This loophole or copyright bypass has greatly harmed the creative industry and has already affected my community with layoffs as well as stoked fires within the entertainment industry i.e WGA/SAG strike with writers and actors. <br/><br/>My peers and I have been working in the creative sector that in 2019 has contributed $919.7 billion or 4.3% of the country&#39;s GDP. There are already Copyright laws in place that prevent Unfair competition of our markets which is what Generative Ai is doing. Companies like Stablility Ai, Midjourney, and now Adobe are scraping/stealing copyrighted works/materials for monetary gain and directly competing in the markets as the copyright holders. <br/><br/>See Lawsuit Anderson Vs. Stability Ai/Midjourney/Deviant Art. Sarah is one such artist that has greatly been affected by being ingested by these data sets and has had her work forged and replicated with Image models such as Stable Diffusion.<br/><br/>If Ai is granted immunity from Copyright laws we will see other countries simply taking what our creative sector has made, wash it through GenAi models and resell it completely cutting out the US economy. Sarah J Olney, a liberal democrat in UK has also addressed this issue as the UK is a massive exporter of entertainment, and this something that great concerns them. <br/><br/>Every industry is in danger of being ingested. If there are no regulations to protect society against predatory practices of a few Tech companies and CEOs we will see massive unemployment, depression and international economic collapse. Unless the government is ready to provide Universal Basic Income for ALL, this issue needs to regulated by the way of Napster. <br/><br/>The advancement of technology is always important, but we have never seen technology that threatens hundreds of millions of jobs all at once. Goldman &amp; Sachs estimates 300 Million jobs worldwide are at risk of being completely abolished. This is the real danger of Generative Ai, and the lack of Copyright enforcement. Authors and Writers have also banded together to sue OpenAi such as Sarah Silverman. <br/><br/>Companies have not asked anyone for permission, they have gone ahead and scraped billions of people and are now looking to self regulate i.e Sam Altman Ceo of OpenAi. This is absolutely ridiculous that we would allow financially interested CEOS to vouch for themselves when Millions of american&#39;s jobs and lives are on the line. The Creative industry is the canary in the coal mine for the entire economy. I have collected a compendium of published articles that address the lawsuits and how the technology of scraping and generative ai actually work.
