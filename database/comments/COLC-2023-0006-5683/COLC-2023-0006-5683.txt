I along with many other artists have witnessed several companies and individuals training AI off of the data of many individuals (both private and personal information) without their consent and/or knowledge. This also includes artists who have passed away and cannot voice their concerns, ones who are not knowledgeable on AI being taken advantage of and children whose photos have allegedly been used to generate inappropriate images of children. (Such as an AI generator that allegedly has been used to create &quot;undressed&quot; images). AI generators and the people who created them have no regard for human creativity or others well being. They should not be able to profit off the backs of creatives who spent time working on their crafts to make it unique, to show and embrace the capability of human imagination. At the very least all AI generators should be required to cite the original creatives, a watermark stating that it&#39;s AI should be required and the artists&#39; who had their images used should receive some form of payment/compensation, their information is required to be removed if they do not consent to it being used in AI&#39;s database. Especially if it&#39;s used for profit. At the very most, it should be considered a privacy violation and copyright infringement resulting in hefty fines/jail time.
