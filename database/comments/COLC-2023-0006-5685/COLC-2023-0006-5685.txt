I have spent many years as part of digital art communities, enjoying the way art and story can entangle people from widely different communities and backgrounds. Art is a common point by which humanity can communicate and share love and life. Many of the people I know have had hopes of supporting themselves financially through art, and some have succeeded. I don&#39;t think anyone would have called it easy. AI art production has taken that sentence and magnified it by a factor of thousands. Organisations that are already looking to downsize can use AI to replace a team of people with a few very overworked staff that are &#39;lucky&#39; to get to work in their passion. AI that is trained on stolen art and cajoled into mimicing the style of artists trying to make a living hurts not only them but everyone else trying to start their career. We all know the adage that artists earn more when they&#39;re dead - frankly, you&#39;re lucky if you can make it more than a decade without producing enough art to train a program on. The most important step we can take to safeguard artists and the future of creative design is to prevent AI-produced works from being copyrighted. If a project requires copyrighted art to exist, it should require an artist to produce that art. No AI. That&#39;s the only way forward.<br/>Thanks for your consideration.
