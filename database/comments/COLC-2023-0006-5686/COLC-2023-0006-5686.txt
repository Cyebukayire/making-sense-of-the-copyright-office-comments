AI is a very dangerous slope that I believe should not be slid down. It&#39;s impossible to copyright, as technically a human didn&#39;t make it, and it put many people&#39;s livelihoods at risk in the name of not paying a person for work, only to find that a computer doesn&#39;t have the rights to own a piece of art, so it doesn&#39;t belong to anyone in the first place. I encourage heavily limiting AI use, copyright and creation, if it&#39;s possible.
