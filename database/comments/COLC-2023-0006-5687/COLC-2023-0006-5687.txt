I am of the opinion that in order for an AI generated piece of media to be copyrighted, all works used to train the AI in question must be owned by the copyrighter. The AI must be exclusively created and trained using original works or works that have been lawfully purchased from their creators along with the associated rights of alteration. The only exceptions should be works in the Creative Commons, or other un-copyrighted AI generated media. Setting up a documented process for lawfully purchasing media for this use would be a priority, perhaps including royalties or other incremental payments depending on number of uses or amount in profit made from the generated image given to each creator who&rsquo;s work was used for training. AI generation has the potential to harm the economy by reducing the market for original media creations - money which is currently spent on a local level by artists and supports their livelihoods. Many AI generators are being used by individuals to mislead customers and create media for economic gain. Since AI is fundamentally unable to create completely original works without being trained on other pieces of media, there must be regulation to ensure that the original creators receive compensation when their work is used to train AI generators. In addition, creators need a path to support and solutions when their copyrighted works and original media are used without permission.
