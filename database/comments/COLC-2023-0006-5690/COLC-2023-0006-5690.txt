I believe that the use of copyrighted work to be fed to an AI program for it to learn should be seen as infringement. I also believe that AI work should not be able to claim any kind of copyright. It goes beyond using someone&#39;s work as inspiration. It blatantly steals and cherry picks parts of work to crush them into an amalgamation. AI programs that use people&#39;s voices or artists art likeness should be liable for infringement. Again, the program did not learn and creat something new, it stole and pieces together something. As for penalties, I don&#39;t know how the laws work for infringement, however I believe that there should be penalties to dissuade the usage of AI in this manner. Robots shouldn&#39;t be making art, they should be doing the harder labor, so humans can make art. &quot;The science of government it is my duty to study, more than all other sciences; the arts of legislation and administration and negotiation ought to take the place of, indeed exclude, in a manner, all other arts. I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.&quot; -John Adams. Why is it that we are still stuck on studying mathematics? I think it is time for a change and I believe that change can come with the use of AI in proper settings.
