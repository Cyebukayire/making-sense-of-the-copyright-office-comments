AI is misrepresented by the name. There is no intelligence involved, it is an algorithm that copies pieces of data and restructures them. By definition, it is incapable of making anything new, it can only take what it has been fed, and current law does not prevent it from being fed material that has been stolen. Moreover, it is being widely used for scams by stealing voices, making people&#39;s own voices say things they never would, which can be defamatory or used to defraud others. <br/><br/>Ai must be strictly regulated. If it is, it can have a place in furthering our society,  as many applications exist for advanced pattern rexognition, but there is no intelligence in it, it cannot make anything new and therefor, unless ALL material it is fed upon is public domain, EVERYTHING  it makes will include stolen material.
