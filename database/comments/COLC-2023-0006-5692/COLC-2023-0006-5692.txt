Hello. I think it is very important, that copyrights not be granted to work created entirely by AI. If thoswe works are &quot;substantially transformed&quot; through human creation, say 80%, then yes they could be consodered as an assistive tool to the creative proccess, but in no way should a company, organization, corporation, or individual be able to merely take output from a machine, trained on the work of others, and copyright it.<br/><br/>To allow this would create chaos, and destabalize the value of the individual, the artist. What is to stop a huge corporation from generating billions of AI scripts/paintings/film pitches/songs etc, copyrighting them all in bulk, and then suing every human creator who makes a work that sounds/looks similar? Nothing would stop that from happening, IF companies and corps are allowed to copyright AI creations that were made handily for them, without having to pay a dime to a human creator. <br/><br/>One of the battles over this is a main point of the current Writers and Actors strikes. Why should we allow AI, that has been trained without permission on the works of human creators, to make works that can then be copyrighted by a corporation so thta they then do not have to pay a human artist? We should Not. <br/><br/>Far simpler would be to say that AI output cannot be copyrighted in most cases. The law I belive defines creation of ouput as ownable by persons, or legally recognized organizations made of persons. The case that comes to mind is when PETA sued on behalf of a monkey that took a photo with a mans camera. The monkey had no legal standing in the US courts, so therefore could not own the photo.<br/><br/>The same should be considered for all AI output. Artifical Intelligences, now and in the future, should never be granted the same legal standing as human beings, and certainly not granted the ability to copyright ideas.<br/><br/>We have always as humans valued the philosophers, the painters, the writers, the artists. AI does not deserve the same reverences, and certainly not the same legal backing of ownership.
