I am a writer and the way many AI have been trained is entirely unethical. It is disheartening to see something that could be a useful tool be used to scrape and steal other people&rsquo;s hard work with no credit or permission. <br/>AI is stealing from the creative well of human expression, and should not be protected under copyright law.
