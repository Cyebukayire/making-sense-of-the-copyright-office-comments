This is a concerning development. Considering the numerous issues already exacerbated by big tech, the development of &#39;generative ai&#39;, large language models and other generative technologies, is predicated on stolen intellectual properties. How is this any different from pirating the copyrighted works of musical artists? Artists deserve better and it&#39;s time for us to take a stand against these types of plagiarism machines that are fed writing, art, music, and other intellectual properties without the knowledge, consent, or acknowledgement of the artists.
