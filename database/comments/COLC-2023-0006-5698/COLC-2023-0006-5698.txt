The fears of AI sound a lot like the fears of Photoshop when it came out making graphic designers mad, Logic Pro or Soundcloud making musicians mad, and any other new thing that comes out making a specific thing easier for others. What has happened to all of them, the best and most talented still stand out, yet those who didn&#39;t have access before get a shot too. I think AI is brilliant and those afraid to evolve with it or use it are just making themselves look old.
