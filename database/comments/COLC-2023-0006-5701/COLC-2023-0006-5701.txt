Artificial intelligence/generative AI as it currently stands relies on the theft of intellectual property of individuals who never agreed to be used in its creation. The data sets that make these AIs possible are all regurgitations of pieces, works, creations of a human being or person somewhere. A computer or AI is not creating anything new with these models, it&#39;s amalgamating the works of several millions or even billions to make something hollow and soulless in its place. If any data set contains even a single work that did not have the express permission of the copyright holder/creator to exist in it, that dataset should be destroyed and the creator reprimanded for violations of copyright law. <br/><br/>New laws and regulations are desperately needed to protect the original creators of works from these AI generative programs. If not: We risk the collapse of entire work forces across multiple industries. People put out of jobs from a cheaper, lesser product output. An output that is simply a mash of something these same people likely even made themselves previously. This is not isolated to artists, or voice actors as an industry either. Programming, writing, and any other number of industries could easily have just as much of the workforce out of a job permanently because there&#39;s a cheaper, as well as morally and legally dubious way, to do it without them at all. <br/><br/>Even looking past the economic impact, there is a cultural impact as well. People will not share or create new works for the world, or that work will never see the light of day. Why would they? When a program could recreate it faster and cheaper, and that same program would rip theirs to make its own model better.  I can tell you that people are already desperate and clambering for ways to keep their works out of these datasets, or poison said set should it end up in the pool without their knowledge. I offer the example of Glaze, a program that masks a digital artwork, or image so that it causes damage should it end up in any dataset without the creators knowledge. Or even the works of millions of artists that now display larger watermarks, displaying in bold lettering &quot;No to AI art&quot; or &quot;do not use in generative art programs&quot;. <br/><br/>I thank you for your time to read, and I hope for an optimal outcome for the good of everyone.
