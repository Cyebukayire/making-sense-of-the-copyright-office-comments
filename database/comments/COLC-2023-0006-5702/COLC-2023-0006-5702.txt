Generative AI content was not created by a single person and derives it&#39;s creations by directly sourcing material that came before it.  If a human were to do such a thing, it would be dubbed &quot;copying&quot; or &quot;plagiarizing.&quot;  The material the AI content is derived from is often already covered under copyright law and, therefore, the AI content cannot be protected in the same way without infringing upon the original work or works&#39; protections.
