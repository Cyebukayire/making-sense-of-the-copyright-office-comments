I do not think that AI should be allowed copyright because It is essentially just taking parts of other people&#39;s work and mixing it together. This is theft and not original work. As an artist and writer, AI artwork and writing poses a threat to the job that allows me to make a living. AI is threatening jobs of many low and middle class workers, not just artists and writers. There needs to be regulations to keep this new technology under control.
