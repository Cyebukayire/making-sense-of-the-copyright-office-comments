I don&rsquo;t believe AI art should be able to be copyrighted. I&rsquo;m not fully anti-AI as a technology, I think it&rsquo;s cool and potentially useful, but I&rsquo;m worried about the broader implications for writers, artists, and other creative fields. Also, given that the AI machine learned was modeled off of art and writing online without asking for consent, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to ask for copyright with compensating the millions of people who&rsquo;s work was used in training, a task that would be impossible.
