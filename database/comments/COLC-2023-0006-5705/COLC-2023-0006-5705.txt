I believe that the courts are correct in their opinion that an AI created piece of work cannot be copyrighted. The AI engines that most people use have not disclosed their training data. Without the disclosure of the data an AI was trained on we do not know if any copyrighted material was ingested and used without permission. We have already had some instances of AI being able to reproduce copyrighted works when given very specific prompts (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13188) and also referencing works that cannot be copyrighted such as fan works (https://www.wired.com/story/fanfiction-omegaverse-sex-trope-artificial-intelligence-knotting/)<br/>This also leaves open the possibility that two people use the same or smilies prompts to get the same image. In that case, who would get the copyright? The execution of a piece of art has always been part of what is copyrighted. How well can you paint that flower or describe that sunset? <br/>This is not to say that AI is not useful it has been extremely useful in protein folding and wildfire fighting. But I believe that the copyright office should try to keep it out of creative fields and that the current ruling that our courts have given us sufficient criteria that allows for artists to copyright and show their work, other artists to experiment with AI but must use it as tool in conjunction with their skill to copyright, and still allow for useful AI applications. <br/>
