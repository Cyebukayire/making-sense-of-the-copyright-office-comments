I have been working professionally in children&#39;s books, animation, video games and graphic novels for over 10 years. I have contributed to works that have received the Eisner Award and the Apple Design Award. My partner Becky is a veteran artist of Disney, Warner Bros, Nickelodeon and Netflix amongst countless others. I was horrified to look into the dataset LAION, which was created by a &quot;non-profit&quot; funded by the for profit AI companies, so as to insulate themselves from the copyright on the works it steals. I sadly found countless examples of the work my wife and I have made. This is work copyrighted many times over, from the publishers we made the work for, to the names and logos of our creator-owned projects. We did not give permission for this to happen, we were not notified and we were not compensated in any way for this. But even more insidious, we found photos of ourselves and our loved ones, you could probably find a photo of yourself that it&#39;s pulled from Facebook or your college newspaper. AI is already beginning to displace jobs in our industries. Book companies have begun using AI art for its book covers. Netflix has aired animation that utilized &quot;AI background art&quot;, work that once would have gone to a team of background designers and painters. Netflix has also already started pressuring writers in development to use AI art as part of the pitching process. This is the kind of work that defines the look and feeling of a show. Development is often low paying, but the pay-off is you could have a television show in your style. It is stealing our work to take our jobs. To call the computer programs that make this work &quot;AI&quot; is a disservice to the countless artists, photographers, writers, journalists, programmers and citizens who use social media who have had their works stolen by large companies hiding behind the curtain of &quot;AI&quot;. All &quot;AI&quot; does is hoover up work that it does not own then smashes it together in a satisfying way. &quot;AI&quot; does not know if the things it tells you are accurate, unless someone earning as low as $2 an hour in Kenya verifies this information (https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/). We&#39;ve had chatbots that did similar, albeit less convincing work, going back to the 90s on the Internet, &quot;AI&quot; is just the latest grift from the venture capital tech industry that we can lump in with the .com boom and the metaverse. The creative industries are suffering as a result of this mass theft. When someone downloads a movie, it&#39;s a crime. When someone takes an image of yours and puts it on a t-shirt and sells it, it&#39;s a crime. Why is it when one tech company (Stability AI) steals 5 billion pieces of work, that it&#39;s somehow ok? It&#39;s not just mass theft, it&#39;s mass theft of our culture, our people&#39;s stories, our person-hood, all in an effort to take our jobs and dreams. If you have further questions, I would be happy to talk more.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Frank Gibson
