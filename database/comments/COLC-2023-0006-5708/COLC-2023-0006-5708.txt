DO NOT give AI any copyright, at all.  <br/><br/>Generated AI works have become a rising problem in the creative field.  The program itself was made to create audio and visual work (still and motion film) by taking original or works from other creatives by mashing it together in the use of word commands and prompts that fit From the generative AI growing, it is not only a discredit for artists and creatives, it is taking away a lot of careers retention and livelihood.  <br/><br/>AI Generated work uses a series of word prompts to create an image based on the most popular images found on the web without artist&#39;s consent.  Because of this, a lot of visual artists are not credited as their work and notable style has been heavily used to create an image.

As Audio files will eventually be used in bigger companies, I fear there will be a bigger loss for voice actors in the future which is why it is important that the government should stress the compensation for actors alike. <br/><br/>I want to point out specifically that the original artist (voice) has used THEIR OWN VOICE and that it is ok to use the voice IF THEY SPLIT THE ROYALTY FEEs.
