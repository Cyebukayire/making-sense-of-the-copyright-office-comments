We are using AI for the wrong things. AI should be used for menial tasks, not for making art. Not for writing stories, making music, making art, or acting. The way AI is being used and the way it is skirting copyright is terrifying. If we don&#39;t take action and stop this madness we&#39;re going to suffer. Our artists are going to suffer. It&#39;s just a way to get out of paying creative people. I don&#39;t know where we went wrong but good gracious we did. Stop the madness.
