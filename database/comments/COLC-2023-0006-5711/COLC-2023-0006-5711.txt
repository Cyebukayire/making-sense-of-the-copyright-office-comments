I believe that generative ai is an incredible advancement in technology and should be used. However it should also come very very heavy regulations. It shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to freely scrape peoples data, or art or anything of that matter. Especially with generative art and large language models, and individuals likenesses there needs to be permissions and compensation when it comes to using artists/authors work. These artists/authors should be able to totally and completely opt out if the want. It&rsquo;s immoral and should be illegal stealing content from hard working individuals. These tools should be used to empower artists not put them out of work.<br/><br/>Midjourney and so many other generative art applications have a paid subscription model and are making millions of dollars while no regard to the artists that make this possible. It&rsquo;s disgusting. This only the start of this technology, and it&rsquo;s growing fast. Regulations need to be put in now if we want to have any control over ai in the future.<br/><br/>These tools can be used for good. For example, trading a model on your own hard work and using that model to enhance your own work. <br/><br/>Thank you for providing the public with this forum.
