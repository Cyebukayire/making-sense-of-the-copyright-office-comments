Generative ai and ai in general should not get copyright, I actually like the regulations rn where only the parts done with human creativity gets copyright and the parts done by ai could be fair use. As ai uses the works of human creatives, who work hard to make art, music, literature etc. to make their living and depends on the copyright services, ai just takes that all, and tries to replace them without consent or compensation. Even the fine tuned versions of ai where they commissioned an artist for their style to be fine tuned, have an underlying database of works from other artists who didn&#39;t get anything. So in general these programs infringe on our copyrights. It would be really helpful, if the copyright office can help maintain the healthy and protective relationship that creatives have with them. Your decision doesn&#39;t just affect the creatives in your country itself but also all the other countries creatives whose countries might take an example from your exceptional support towards human artists.
