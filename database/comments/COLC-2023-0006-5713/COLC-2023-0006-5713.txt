Hello, my name is Sarah Wilder and I am an artist who makes a living doing graphic design and illustration work. AI generated imagery is a direct threat to my work. AI trained on the work of artists does not use art the same way a human does. In my opinion, the major issue with Generative AI is that thousands of artist&#39;s work has been used to train these machines, which are being used to create profit for the companies making them. At no point were those artists asked permission or properly compensated for the commercial, profit-earning use of their hard work. AI could be used to make our lives easier, to help people and make dangerous jobs safer. Instead, its being used to erase creative jobs done by passionate people. These companies need to be held accountable for their actions. AI trained on unlicensed art needs to be retrained on the art of properly compensated artists. Thank you for taking the time to read my comment.
