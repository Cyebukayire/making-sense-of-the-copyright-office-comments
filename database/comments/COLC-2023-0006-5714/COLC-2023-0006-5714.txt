I believe anything made or done by AI should never have copyright protection. As we all know by now, it has been used to exploit artists&rsquo; and other creators&rsquo; work to serve a market that mainly steals from these same people while trying to monopolize on their hard work.<br/><br/>Simply put, nothing that is created by a machine deserves copyright protection, especially when it is abused for art theft.
