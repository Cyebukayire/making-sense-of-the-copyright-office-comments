I am a rookie pixel artist, someone who uses art programs on a computer to create digital artwork in the style of old videogames, where the raw squares of color, the pixels, are on full display. AI generation of artwork has been a major problem for many artists like myself- not only have groups taken others&#39; artwork they had shared online without permission to train their models on, there have been many end users of these softwares who have outright questioned the need to pay actual artists for their work, when the AI they use can give them what they want for free. I have personally witnessed people stating these exact sentiments toward my fellow artists. Allowing people to copyright AI-generated works would irreparably harm artists like myself, in any medium, further encouraging people to reject paying people for their work under the logic of, &quot;Why should I pay, when AI can give me everything I want, including copyright, for free?&quot; Entire peoples&#39; livelihoods are threatened by this- some artists&#39; income is exclusively through the services they provide.<br/><br/>This is to say nothing of the issues regarding potential copyright infringement. There have been AI models created where the developers have explicitly stated they set their software to ignore requests that AI not take the images, because they view such requests as harmful to their goals, and thus believe they are right to take whatever they wish anyway. There have even been attempts before to use AI to create faked images for news headlines, to create an event that never actually happened, which then spread widely because people thought they were genuine.<br/><br/>I implore you, do not allow AI-generated media to grant copyright to the humans who use the software. It goes against all who create.
