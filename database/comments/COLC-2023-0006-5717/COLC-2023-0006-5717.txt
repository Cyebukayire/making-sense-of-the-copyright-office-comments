Present AI is basically just plagiarism engines.  It&#39;s designed to mimic people&#39;s art styles, writing styles, actual physical likenesses, etc.  It is designed to make real people&#39;s art worthless.  All the things we could be doing with this, and it&#39;s being used to literally steal more joy and more money from the largest group of people with the least happiness and the least money.  This absolutely cannot be permitted to be accepted as copyright-worthy.  It is not creation.  It cannot generate something new of its own.  It is a machine which generates theft.
