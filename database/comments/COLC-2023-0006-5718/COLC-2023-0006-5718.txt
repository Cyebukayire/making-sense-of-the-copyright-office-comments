AI generated works scrape information to train itself from those who provide work and labour and have done for years - and delivers a product that lacks the humanity of the actual people it has been trained on. Whilst AI is not an idea I find disingenuous, I do not believe it is currently being used correctly nor in an ethically sustainable way and laws need to be put in place to protect individuals who have dedicated their lives to trades and craft man ships. Companies and individuals beginning to use AI work to replace their workers because of cost efficient reasons have shown that they lack the empathy, understanding and ability to appreciate what human hands and minds are capable of fulfilling for their fellow kind. With cost of living, impacts still following the Covid-19 pandemic and overall poverty - human made talents were needed and rose up to aid others during these hard times. I fully feel that we should support the humanity that a lot of AI cannot feasibly replace or replicate without losing the spark of living individuals behind it. AI will surely stagnate and can only work to it&#39;s best ability by drawing on the best parts of dedicated people. However dedicated people do not stagnate, they grow and evolve. They provide necessities and luxuries that an AI simply cannot and it is my belief that the human workers be cared for and protected from individuals whose greed outweighs their compassion.
