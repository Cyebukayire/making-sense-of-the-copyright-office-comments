&ldquo;Where did you learn how to do your art? You looked at art. Whose art was it? You learned their techniques, you studied their art, you added it to your repertoire,&rdquo;<br/>-Jason Allen<br/>https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/09/02/midjourney-artificial-intelligence-state-fair-colorado/<br/><br/>This argument alone makes up for considering &quot;fair use&quot; of the generative models to scrape as much art/photos/images as possible to make quality generations. There&#39;s no need for overthinking it; just as people learn and even try to copy works of other people, master pieces, etc. as they develop their expertise, so the AI systems. How else would they learn, if not by looking at other pieces of art? <br/><br/>Regarding copyright, there&#39;s also another analogy. When a photographer takes a picture, they use a machine, that in some ways, helps save time (instead of painting). And today, there&#39;s no denying that photography has its place among the visual arts (by the way, it didn&#39;t replace painting). <br/><br/>So can the photographer register a photo for protection? Yes, so why can&#39;t an AI artist also register their work too? I understand there&#39;s a general belief that AI art is done mostly automatically and without artist&#39;s effort, and it&#39;s true, it can be done like that, but the arsenal of tools and settings available to play with and to further direct this new tech is growing; please research &quot;Control Net&quot; for Stable Diffusion. These tools both imply lots of work (and training for the user to understand how to use it) and they also mean intention, not just randomness. There are a lot of tools that help shape creations in ways that are not trivial, meaning that the artist spends time, effort and thought to generate ideas that have purpose, intent, and value. Besides, at least in current industry&#39;s standards, even after working with all of these, the image may need further refining in other software like photoshop, which means more artist manual and direct input to fulfill a vision. Is this not enough to consider art produced with these workflows candidate for copyright protection?<br/><br/>I leave you with a final quote:<br/><br/>&quot;By Invading the Territories of Art, Photography Has Become Art&rsquo;s Most Mortal Enemy&quot;<br/>-Charles Baudelaire, 1859<br/>https://quoteinvestigator.com/2022/10/16/photo-mortal/<br/><br/>Hope this quote helps get things into perspective: we, as humanity, sometimes fear new technology, are uncertain of how to feel, what to expect. We feel invaded. But I&#39;ll tell you one thing: AI is not going away, but it will keep growing. Will we embrace it to make us improve our works and art, enhance or workflows, or will we stick our head in the ground, deny the obvious advantages of it and try to block it?
