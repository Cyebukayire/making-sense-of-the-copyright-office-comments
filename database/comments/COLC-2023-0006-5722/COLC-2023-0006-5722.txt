Automation was once advertised as a way for people to do less work and focus more on creative pursuits. That was the whole point! Things would get easier with each consecutive generation and there would be more artists, more creatives, more time for expression. That was always the goal. And now, here we are, using that lauded automation to replace art and literature with generative, bland, sometimes fully unintelligible slop, so that people don&rsquo;t need to waste time on creativity and can instead focus on being ground down into grist in a machine of endless toil. It&rsquo;s foul, and it&rsquo;s cruel. We shouldn&rsquo;t let this happen.
