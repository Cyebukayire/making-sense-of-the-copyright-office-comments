As an artist I find AI incredibly harmful I&#39;ve had my work stolen by AI and it&#39;s users these AI companies and AI users are profiting off my stolen art. I know many other artists who have had their jobs stolen by AI that can not exist with out their stolen work. I have been verbally attacked by AI users when I&#39;ve tried to protect my work and I&#39;ve had them rub it in my face that their is nothing I can do to stop them from stealing my copyrighted work. AI and it&#39;s users create nothing all they do is steal their is absolutely no way AI should ever be protected by copyright. Artist are essential for AI to function is every artist stoped creating art in weeks the crap AI spits out would melt into unrecognizable mush because it can not survive with out constant stolen data being pumped into it . Stronger protections need to be put in place for artist to protect them from AI theft. These AI companies owe artist collectively millions for all the copyrights they have infringed on with AI. it&#39;s not just artist being stolen from musicians are being stolen from by AI companies and peoples likenesses are being stolen by AI! Protect creatives it&#39;s time AI is seriously regulated and banned from using any copyrighted material and these AI companies NEED TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE and forced to pay out to all the artist they have stolen from. AI companies tried to save face by saying they would add watermarks to AI images but most haven&#39;t and the ones that have did not do this to help people tell if something was AI they did this so the AI would not cannibalize it&#39;s self because AI can not train off AI images it begins to fall apart if it tries. Their is no world where AI exist without artist stolen work and their is no world where AI is ethical or in anyway human creation. AI IS NOTHING BUT THEFT! THAT IS FACT!! Protect artist copyright and make AI companies pay for what they&#39;ve stolen.
