I absolutely oppose any legislation making AI generated art or literature into copyrighted material.  I&#39;ve already seen artists and writers have their work scrapped and the &#39;new&#39; pieces sold.  Uncredited data sets are a problem to me, but the problem doesn&#39;t stop there.  Artists already struggle for work in America, and ai works being copyrightable means that companies searching for art and writing will rely on lower cost, industry ruining ai work. I do believe it has potential as an assistive tool for artists and their clients, or to create a concept to draw from, but I absolutely oppose ai being copyrightable content on its own.
