Thank you for taking the time to get public comments on such an important topic. I am a freelance illustrator and picture book author who is directly impacted by the rise of generative AI. I am connected to a large community of writers and illustrators who seem to share similar concerns to me. One of the main concerns is  that generative AI has been trained on images/texts that artists like me have made, but without our permission, without formal acknowledgement and without remuneration to the originators of the artwork. The countless hours of work  that we have put in to develop our skills has been scrubbed for AI&rsquo;s benefit, only to then have AI directly compete with us. Things like copyrights become seemingly meaningless when AI can scrub our work to create something similar, but different  enough that it can get around copyright/plagiarism issues. <br/>This is all a side note, however to the very real potential for AI to put artists and writers out of work. If my copyrighted material can be used to train AI, which can then create something for less money and in less time, then my livelihood is directly threatened by competition that has no boundaries. Artists and writers are rightly concerned about the potential AI possesses, the potential for generative AI to wipe out our industries while it stands on the backs of our skills.  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before other industries are deeply impacted as well.
