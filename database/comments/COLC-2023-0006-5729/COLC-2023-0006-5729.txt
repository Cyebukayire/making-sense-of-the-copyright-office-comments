I firmly believe AI-generated works should not be copyrightable. AI-generated works are the product of stolen work. To me, copyright laws exist to protect every creative individual, their ideas, their time, and their livelihoods. These computer algorithms are fed data from actual original content made by humans and often times without the original artist/writer&#39;s knowledge let alone consent and in order to make AI-generated work, all one must do is enter a simple prompt and click a button. It would an insult to creatives everywhere for these blatant art thieves to be able to copyright these stolen amalgamations. By making AI-generated works copyrightable, the U.S. Copyright Office would be paving the road for the graveyard of every creative field and prioritizing individuals who value quantity over quality and shallow aesthetics over the human experience. Please, I beg you, do not let AI-generated works become copyrightable.
