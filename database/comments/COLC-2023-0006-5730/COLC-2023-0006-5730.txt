AI-generated materials, by default, is trained on work from others, often without or against their permission (effectively making it based on stolen work). This has come to light most often with art sites (e.g. Deviantart), but is still threatened in other ways (e.g. Elon Musk&#39;s plan to train AI on tweeted materials written by the public at large). This goes beyond the artistic process and free-use. Allowing such to be copyrightable renders the concept of a &quot;copyright&quot; meaningless (what use is copyright if the copyrighted material can be trained on freely for profit?).<br/><br/>Furthermore, I am very concerned with the possibility and probability of technology abuse, on both individual and corporate levels. This is already growing more and more prominent in several industries, and I worry that official condoning by the government would worsen the issue by several degrees. <br/><br/>While the prominent examples of misuse is in the arts, I&#39;m already seeing concerning usage of the technology in marketing, IT and other tech fields.<br/><br/>I do not feel that we should be afraid of AI-generated materials, but limitations must be placed. Accepting that the are inherently based on the work of others and the human touch is heavily limited, it should not be covered by copyright laws in any way. Instead, it should be wholly creative commons.
