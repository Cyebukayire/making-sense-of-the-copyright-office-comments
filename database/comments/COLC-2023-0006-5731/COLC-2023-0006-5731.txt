AI generated content SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE COPYRIGHTED <br/>Allowing it to be will destroy the entertainment industry. Creating soulless, empty works and putting thousands, if not millions of people worldwide out of work. AI programs for writing and art are plagiarism machines.<br/>The way these programs are being trained and used is stealing the work of real people, and devaluing the arts as a whole. It&rsquo;s not okay. Put a stop to it before we have nothing coming out of hollywood but Ai generated garbage.
