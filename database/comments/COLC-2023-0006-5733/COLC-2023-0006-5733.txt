AI generated content, which is nothing more than theft, allows mega corporations and monopolies to reap huge profits by stealing the art, writing, voice, and video from individuals who don&#39;t have the means, abilities or perhaps knowledge to demand fair compensation for it&#39;s use. Work in the arts is already maligned and treated as foolish, while simultaneously consumed at massive levels by billions of people every day. If corporations like Disney, Meta, Google, Aetna, big pharma, anyone at all, are allowed to steal the hard work of others and profit from it illegally with impunity, then what does that say for the importance we claim to place on individuality and manifest destiny? Art, writing, speaking and singing, video, and the individual style of each creator of such is and can only be, the original, copyright work of a human. AI &quot;scraping&quot;, remixing, and repackaging is theft and not allowable for protection under copyright law.
