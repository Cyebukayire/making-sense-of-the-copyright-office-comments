Any media produced by AI should not be able to be copyrighted, as the work is not produced by a person and therefore has no creator. This is the extent to which I believe this should be regulated, as the use of AI &quot;art&quot; isn&#39;t inherently a bad thing, as it can be used as a tool to help along the creative process.
