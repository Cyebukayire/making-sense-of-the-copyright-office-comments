Just another crappy, manipulative way for 3% of powerful people to exploit, steal from, and control the working class. The making of the next huge shift in workers rights, humane working conditions, anti-monopoly laws a la the industrial revolution. It&#39;s a duplicitious name as well: it&#39;s not &quot;smart&quot;, it&#39;s associative, and the cultish groupthink around the tech-government oligarchy running the show tells me that the good of the people is not what those running the operation have in mind. You&#39;re STEALING From people and producing half-rate imitations. Individual human rights and labor need to be protected at all costs. How DARE you lie to us. How DARE you claim you can&#39;t audit your own tool. How DARE you pretend that this is somehow in our benefit. Copyright office needs to protect the human being and their productions. The public internet should not be allowed to just &quot;be scraped&quot;. &quot;AI&#39; needs sanitized, contained datasets. PERIOD.
