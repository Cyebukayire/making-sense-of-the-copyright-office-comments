Hello there,<br/><br/>This discussion around machine learning and it&rsquo;s value really has taken an odd turn in the discussion of it.  The sales pitch is that the diffusion models are artificial intelligence and that it is somehow sentient and deserves some kind of carve out to allow copyright for profit seeking purposes.  I disagree!  If these algorithms were not dependent on the stolen input without permission or compensation to the professional artists they have trained these algorithms on, there might be a different conversation to be had.  Unfortunately this is not the case.  It is smoke and mirrors to defend plagiarism.  Respect creatives not snake oil salesmen.<br/><br/>Thank you
