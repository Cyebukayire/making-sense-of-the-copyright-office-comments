As a working artist, I&#39;m very distressed and concerned about the current lack of legislation concerning AI generated content. Artificial Intelligence by nature is exploitative and unethical as many of the current models are built from stealing work from human artists without consent or compensation. Already, artists have seen a loss of jobs and opportunities because of AI, and the issue will only get worse unless laws are put in place to restrict the use of AI and it&#39;s ability to attain copyrights. Ideally, any AI should be required to not only wipe their current databases, which are filled with stolen work, but also only be able to rebuild those databases with public domain creations or require compensation for and permission from the artists whose work is used. Art is one thing that makes us truly human and the use of AI undermines our existence as creative and complex beings. I hope that legislation will be put in place to protect human artists&#39; rights and that the laws won&#39;t just side with those who want to make money off of other people&#39;s creations.
