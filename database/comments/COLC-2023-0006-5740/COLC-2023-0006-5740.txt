What is referred to as AI is not truly artificial intelligence. It&#39;s algorithms, synthesizing data. Stolen data. Copyright is to protect humans who create unique art, inventions, products, so that they may benefit from their ingenuity. A corporation attempting to copyright the scan of an actor&#39;s face that is then made to animate in the background of a movie is not ingenuity. It&#39;s theft.
