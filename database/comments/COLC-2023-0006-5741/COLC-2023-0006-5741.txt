No corporation should be allowed to copyright something that a human didn&rsquo;t create. This will just create a new generation of copyright trolls who generate thousands upon thousands of AI generated prompts, and then wait to sue anybody who makes anything close to the thing they didn&rsquo;t even create in the first place. AI generated &ldquo;art&rdquo; is an insult to life itself and should not be allowed to exist with the protection of the law.
