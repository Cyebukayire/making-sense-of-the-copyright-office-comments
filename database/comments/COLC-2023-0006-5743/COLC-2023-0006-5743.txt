Copyright is meant to protect products of human labor. Because these systems are trained with unauthorized images and text, and because how it is using that information is not disclosed to us, it&#39;s impossible to know how much is outright theft and plagiarism. The idea of extending copyright to machine output will only devalue the work of human beings and destroy the livelihood of those who depend on those works. Thank you.
