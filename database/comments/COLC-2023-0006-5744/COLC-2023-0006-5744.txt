Media made by AI does nothing for anyone and should not be copyrightable as it relies on the works of others. Ai generators don&#39;t rely on works given to them or sold to them, rather they are stolen from a variety of creators and businesses. This is the case especially for online digital artists. Whether an AI generator relies on copyrighted or non-copyrighted works, said works are made by people who are not paid, credited, or even acknowledged while their creations have been scraped for AI generation.
