AI needs regulations, for everyone&#39;s sake. It has been shown numerous times how unethical AI can be without proper regulations.<br/>It can be a great tool but right now, it creating copyright and ethical issues that no one should ever have to deal with.<br/>Artists have lost a lot of money and have been stolen countless times, actors are being scanned and paid pennies for big corporations to use them as they please without proper compensation.<br/>Creative workspace is literally being compromised. AI should be helping people, not taking over them.<br/>Please regulate AI and give proper help to artists to defend themselves. <br/>I&#39;ve seen people lose their creative job to an AI because it was more &quot;cost-effective&quot;. This should never happen and I hope Congress will help their people, not big corporation and their bots.
