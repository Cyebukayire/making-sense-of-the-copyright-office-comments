People may think AI helps relieve a lot of busywork and the painful labor of many jobs, but it consistently threatens numerous positions worldwide and is just an excuse for multibillion dollar CEOs to not pay people in exchange for even more money to increase the wealth. AI could be used sustainably, but right now it&rsquo;s copyright theft on a horrendous scale. Either these systems should heavily monitored and be used in industries where they&rsquo;re needed most(definitely not the entertainment industry by any means) like software engineering ot medicine, or they should be banned outright as soon as possible.
