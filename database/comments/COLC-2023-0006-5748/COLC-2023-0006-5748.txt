Generative AI trained off of our data with the expressed interest in &quot;replacing&quot; the very work stolen from us by its creators is an abhorrent affront to not just copyright law, but to the complete disregard for the worth of our work and humanity in general. <br/><br/>They loudly, proudly steal and make mockery of both the law and any semblance of respect held for the hard work and livelihoods of others. It is due to this that it is of my fervent belief that generative AI should in no way be legal as it stands today. They have no right to use our work, to profit off of it, to steal our faces, our loved one&#39;s photos, while loudly proclaiming their intent to replace working artists and photographers. They treat copyright like a joke while seeking to apply the same rules to their frankenstein &quot;creations&quot; spit out by their ill-begotten coded theft. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading.
