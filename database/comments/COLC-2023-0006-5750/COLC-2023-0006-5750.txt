AI infringes on the copyright of artists and writers, it scrapes the internet for content without the consent of artists to train their ai models. As it currently stands AI is unethical and should not be allowed until it wipes the data it has stolen from unwilling parties. AI should not be eligible for copyright because it is created on a mass of copywritten content, it makes no logical sense to allow copyright for stolen intellectual property. AI models that are trained solely on data that has been authorized to be use in AI training is acceptable but this requires the AI holder to be held accountable and responsible for the data they are putting in.
