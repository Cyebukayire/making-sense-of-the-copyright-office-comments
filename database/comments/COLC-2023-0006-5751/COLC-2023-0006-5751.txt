I&#39;m writing to express my deep concerns about the blatant and illegal appropriation of artists&#39; creations by generative AI technologies. Ethical considerations are entirely absent here; these systems merely reshuffle existing art that they&#39;ve acquired without permission. The creators of such software openly acknowledge that they serve as imperfect repositories of pre-existing works. Conversations among the leaders of companies like Midjourney and Stability AI, captured and verified, reveal not just a disregard for intellectual property laws, but also involvement in the creation and ownership of unlawful materials, including child exploitation content.<br/><br/>These tech-savvy individuals are far from intelligent when it comes to ethics and legality. The U.S. government&#39;s ineffectiveness in enforcing its own laws against these companies is nothing short of baffling, given the potential harm to livelihoods, privacy, and even the democratic process. This ineptitude is disgraceful, warranting nothing less than profound shame.<br/><br/>The sole reason these AI platforms possess any market value is that they freely pilfer the creative works of others&mdash;a modern form of slavery. Far from offering any new insights, these platforms are merely stagnant archives of other people&#39;s intellectual property, rearranged but essentially unoriginal. Any comparison of these systems to automation technologies or industrial tools is fundamentally flawed, especially when the original creators own the intellectual property being manipulated.<br/><br/>There&#39;s no sum of money sufficient to compensate for these infringements; even the trillions of dollars theoretically owed in licensing fees couldn&#39;t cover it. Market valuations in the billions are trivial compared to the tremendous economic losses incurred by these unauthorized uses. The idea that copyrighted content can&#39;t be removed from these systems is absurd; it&#39;s not an issue of impossibility but of cost. If compliance with a DMCA request or the removal of illegal content costs a business $700,000, then that business model is fundamentally flawed.<br/><br/>Any scheme involving &quot;profit-sharing&quot; or &quot;residuals&quot; that allows a company to act as an unnecessary go-between for artists and their audiences is entirely unacceptable, as evidenced by the failures in the music industry. In this context, consent is non-negotiable, and currently, it is conspicuously absent. Grand promises of medical breakthroughs or other societal benefits do not justify the unscrupulous actions of these tech companies. It&#39;s embarrassing that the U.S. government would even consider legitimizing these activities.<br/><br/>The exploitation enabled by these technologies contravenes the founding principles of this nation, including constitutional protections of intellectual property. It&#39;s incomprehensible why a modern, advanced, and educated government can&#39;t address these fundamental issues and eliminate such fraudulent practices.
