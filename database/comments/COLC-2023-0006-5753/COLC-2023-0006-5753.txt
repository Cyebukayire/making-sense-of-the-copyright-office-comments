As a freelance writer, illustrator and a previous educator, I have a many concerns about generative AI. The nature of the thing does not allow for new information to be shared, only regurgitated biases that serve pre-existing notions about the world. It threatens the careers and livelihoods of individuals millions of Americans who pay their bills through careers in the arts. Our last safeguard in place against total exploitation and theft of our work in the commercial space is the inability to copyright generated work. I urge you to please refrain from removing this wall and instead strengthen it. We need protections in place to protect our work from further theft and punishments in place for large entities that seek to employ less creatives and use more machines.
