The datasets and introduction of AI as they stand today are a direct threat to my livelihood as an independent artist. My work is taken without my knowledge. I do not receive credit, compensation and I am not asked whether or not my work can be used. <br/>Not only is AI currently a threat the datasets and manner of which they are scraped will make it so any future AI will be made on equally unconsented to, uncompensated and uncredited work.
