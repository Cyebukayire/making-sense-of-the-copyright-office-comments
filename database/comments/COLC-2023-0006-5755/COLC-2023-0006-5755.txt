My name is Sean Closson, I am a freelance illustrator/artist.<br/><br/>I feel that the issue of AI with regards to copyright is one of the most important issues today in regards to how it will effect the workforce, personal ownership of intellectual property, and human cultural expression. I have already had my work scraped without my consent in order to train models that are being used to directly compete with me for potential work, I have seen countless individual stories from other people recounting their experiences of how this technology is being abused even though it is still in it&#39;s infancy. The fact is that AI tech is moving way too fast and needs to be regulated. I think the current policy of the Copyright Office that elements generated by AI is a good one but it needs to be cemented in law and not just in a single administration&#39;s policy. Copyright should be reserved for human creators, especially when talking about a technology that needs preexisting human work in order to function. <br/><br/>Human creativity has been what defines a culture in context to its time and place in history, if we leave that expression to machine based algorithms our culture will stagnate. This technology is already leading to the possibility that this current generation of working artists, musicians, and other creatives may be the last one in recorded history. Creative people deserve to be the ones making money from their endeavors, they shouldn&#39;t have to deal with the threat of others feeding their work into a machine to make a profit off of work they didn&#39;t produce and didn&#39;t pay to use.<br/><br/>I know as an artist that most people have no sympathy for my struggles, most people are happy to consume the work of creatives while insulting them for making the choice to pursue such work in the first place because they have an ill-informed cultural bias based on decades-old stereotypes of what a creative worker is. We are supposed to be lazy, starving artists and any financial issues we have are our own fault, but the truth is that  most of us work harder than the average person to make a living doing something we love, our work being used to train AI is something we did not consent to. Copyright is supposed to protect what we create so that others cannot profit off of our labor without compensating us first, by granting copyright to AI generated products that were trained on preexisting copyrighted material you would be essentially saying that individual copyright ownership doesn&#39;t mean anything and that protections only apply to those with the deepest pockets. I know that legally going after someone for copyright infringement is usually something only the wealthy can afford, but there should be a basic form of protection enjoyed by any individual who writes a book, produces a song, or paints a painting. AI technology, by it&#39;s very nature, would destroy that protection if it was given any sort of copyright.
