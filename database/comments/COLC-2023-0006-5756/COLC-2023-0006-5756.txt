AI is simply a new medium. 3D is geometry based rendering. AI is statistics based rendering. Both are simply math based rendering.<br/><br/>AI is only a copyright issue if you consider statistics a copyright issue. If I gather statistics on thousands of movies, did I steal those movies? No, I did not.<br/><br/>AI, and statistics, falls well within the substantiality requirements. For example, Stable Diffusion gathered statistics on 5 billion images but it&#39;s model, the only thing people need to generate images, is only 5GB, 5 billion bytes. That means the mathematical maximum amount of information the AI could retain about each image in the dataset is a single number from 0 to 255, a fourth of a pixel. In practice, it&#39;s fractions of that.<br/><br/>Kneecapping AI now would be like kneecapping 3D art or VFX in the 90&#39;s because it competed with traditional artists.<br/><br/>What kind of work would that be?
