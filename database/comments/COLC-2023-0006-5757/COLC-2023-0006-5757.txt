I am a professional artist who works in the animation industry. My client list has included Disney, Marvel, Sony, Titmouse and many more. As an artist who works in a copyrighted industry I understand the value of the art that I create both in a financial aspect as well as a cultural. It has lead to a successful and fulfilling career in the arts for me that I rely on for my livelihood as do thousands of other professionals animation artists like me and the millions of other creatives who work in related copyrightable industries.<br/><br/>As an artist, I&#39;ve chosen to dedicate my professional life to the creation of art. This has been referred to as the humanities, because engaging with the arts is a fundamentally human pursuit that reflects our personal lived experiences, cultural backgrounds and inherent creative inspiration. Art is an expression of the human condition and the life of an artist is a cyclical and generational path. Every artist is born and must learn and acquire the creative abilities that they desire through careful study, years of training and devotion to their craft. This investment requires an immense amount of effort and money on the part of the artist to acquire the skills to produce the world class art that we all enjoy and which creates the fabric of our human culture. Human artists are capable of producing the highest quality art possible, however we are bound by physical limitations such as a finite life span, limited energy, requirements for food, shelter, health and financial stability in order to meet the circumstances required to simply produce artwork. It is necessary that our livelihoods as artists are protected from predatory big tech companies in order to ensure the preservation of our culture and the future works of our next generation of great human artists.<br/><br/>Big tech companies such as Meta, Microsoft, Stability AI, Open Ai and many more have chosen to target human artists to exploit their Labor by scraping our artwork in the billions from the internet to use in the development of generative AI tools that seek to compete with living working human artists in our own fields, using our own work against us, to undercut our value and steal our job opportunities. This is an unacceptable and unforgivable act that must be stopped. Artists work is instilled with copyright protections from the moment pen touches paper. We deserve to have our creative labor protected and our rights upheld from data mining by greedy big tech companies.<br/><br/>As laid out by artist Karla Ortiz, we must create safeguards to ensure both protections for artists while creating a space for gen AI tools to exist. In order for an artists work to be used in the development of gen AI tools we must require these companies to:<br/><br/>1) Receive consent from the artist or copyright holder for use<br/>2) Give credit to the human artist who produced the original source material.<br/>3) Negotiate compensation for the use of art or writing as training data as negotiated by the artist.<br/>4) Provide transparency of Gen AI training data sets and development tools to ensure data is sourced ethically.<br/><br/>These are the safe guards we are requesting as creative professionals for the preservation of our crafts, the protection of valuable human labor, and the future of our culture. <br/><br/>We can not view the creations of Gen AI tools as the same as human creations. The differences between human art and Gen AI art are fundamental. Gen AI has no understanding of the world around us, no inherent thought, creativity or vision and no ability to think or feel as humans do. These are the fundamental drivers of what lead humans to create art which expresses the human condition. At best, gen AI is a cheap knock off of the genuine article, at worst it is an existential threat to the future of the humanities. Gen AI is at it&#39;s core a cheap and inferior knock that only appeals to corporations because of its labor exploitation and monetizable potential. These companies do not care about our culture or genuine human expresssion. They are simply looking for the next means to extract more profit from humans who are ripe for exploitation. We can not and will not go quietly. The Hollywood strikes this year are the first of many. We need government and legal protections or this situation is bound to get much worse.<br/><br/>We must have artists represented in the legislation of AI in copyright law. Big tech companies have dishonestly developed these tools, relying on data laundering to scrape copyrigted works in the billions from the internet, asking for forgiveness after commiting the crime rather than asking for consent before committing it. They are gambling on the law not being able to adapt quickly enough to their exploitative practices and huge investor money pools. We need to rein them in before this gets out of control. <br/><br/>I thank you very much for hearing my views and allowing me a space to express myself! I hope you will hear and weigh my concerns in your future legislation.
