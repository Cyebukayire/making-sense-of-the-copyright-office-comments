Let&#39;s begin with the fact that these AI programs stole copyrighted art from people who worked hard to create it (and in many cases paid the COPYRIGHT OFFICE). That some lazy, money-grubbing person can use these programs without having spent a day with a paintbrush and come anywhere near a copyright is abominable. This BS needs to stop.
