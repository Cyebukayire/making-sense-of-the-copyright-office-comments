AI, as it currently stands, cannot create art purely on its own. It must be &quot;trained&quot; - as in using art taken from real, human artists - in order to generate &quot;new&quot; art. Far too many AI generators take art, writing, and voice talents from these people without their permission and mash them together with no rhyme or reason. If a human person did the same, they would be sued for copyright infringement.<br/><br/>Companies all over the world take advantage of these generators, firing their artists and instead using AI generation to avoid paying real people their fair share. This is one of many reasons union guilds like the Writers&#39; Guild Association (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) are currently on strike. Several company-run websites - primarily ones focused around art or social media where art is shared frequently - have quietly added ways to scrape their user base for art they can &quot;implement&quot; into AI generation. Oftentimes, users are automatically opted-in to these features by default, and some websites do not have a way to opt-out altogether. This means that any user contributing art to these sites and apps effectively have their rights to their art stripped from them, sometimes without their knowledge, and get zero compensation in return. A significant majority of users in social media and art-sharing websites are not employed by the companies that run them; for a company to take art from its users is theft.<br/><br/>Creators and managers of AI generators must require permission to include an artist&#39;s work in their generation process. Any operator who fails to follow this basic rule of respect should be fined and have all instances of the infringing work deleted from their database - at the bare minimum. If people who steal creative works from others are punished, so too should the people operating AI generators that steal just the same.
