Generative or AI art is not art. It&#39;s taking the work of thousands of artists, without their consent, and throwing it into a blender and claiming it as their own &quot;work&quot; - simply typing some words into a text box. I spent over 30 years practicing and refining my work only to have people literally upload it all into their database in an effort to just copy it and replace me.
