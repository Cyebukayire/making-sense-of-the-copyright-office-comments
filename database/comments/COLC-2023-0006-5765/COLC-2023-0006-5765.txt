Speaking purely of objective fact that I&#39;m aware of, AI image generation works by creating a learning algorithm that draws from a dataset of source images to produce images that resemble the source ones. In my opinion, this should be the largest point of focus in regulating AI image generation copyright, because the way that many of the biggest datasets have been made is by downloading art with little regulation or care for licensing. There are also examples of websites that sell their users&#39; images to dataset collections and will opt them in by default without their knowledge. For many people this can be a nightmare; important documents, their own faces, their entire portfolio of artworks could be submitted to a dataset and there&#39;s no real guarantee of getting it removed. I think that the people who produce these datasets should be subject to many more regulations in how they gather those images, and it should be illegal to opt users of a website into waiving rights of their images and submitting to an AI image dataset collection without their knowledge and consent.
