As an Artisit A.I. is taking jobs away and killing my livelihood. They take copyrighted images without consent and attempt to profit off others work. An artist also doesn&#39;t receive any credit when their work is stolen. A.I simply mashes current images together. This needs to be heavily regulated, the databases deleted and a 100% opt in for said collected images. A.I is theft plain and simple.  Artists and other creative fields are suffering because of A.I. They take our work and we receive nothing in return. Any other industry this would be a massive case of lawsuits.
