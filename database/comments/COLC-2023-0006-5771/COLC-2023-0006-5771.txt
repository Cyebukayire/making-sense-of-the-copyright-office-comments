My name is Michael Laviolette I&rsquo;m a graphic designer and visual artist.<br/><br/>Generative AI is simply unethical. It&rsquo;s built off stolen artwork, taken without the consent of artists and packaged by for profit tech companies.<br/><br/>As seen with many other industries, tech giants aim to extract all the value of a sector, drive prices down to a point where it is impossible for others to compete, and then create new problems for local economies. <br/><br/>Artists work their entire lives to hone their craft and create a distinct voice. Artistry, in general, is already a difficult path to make a living and generative AI will further exhaust this.<br/><br/>Not only that, but from a cultural and purely human perspective, art is meant to be a form of communication and self-expression. We do not need this to be fabricate by algorithms for profit.<br/><br/>AI should be put to work to solve healthcare, housing and economic problems impacting our society. NOT crushing the human spirit by automating the arts.
