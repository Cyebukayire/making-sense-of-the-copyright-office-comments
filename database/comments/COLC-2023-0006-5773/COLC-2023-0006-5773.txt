I am greatly worried about works of AI being able to hold copyright - as the backbone of these programs are built on artist&#39;s copyrighted work used without consent. It would be easy to &quot;launder&quot; images through AI, adding minor tweaks, and calling it a new creation when normally there would be protections against editing / theft. Having AI as another loophole against artist&#39;s dwindling protections would be terrible. AI is currently used to impersonate living, working artists and sold at profit (such as - Adobe&#39;s stock image storefront, using living artists as keyword searches for these AI images, ironically using Adobe&#39;s creator base and their hard work against themselves, and creating issues of false identity). Artwork should be opt-in only to be used in AI, and opt out as a default. Being able to copyright these works created without consent sets a terrible precedent. If anything - protections for human-made art should be increased, responding to these threats. <br/><br/>How can you enforce an AI copyright if the algorithm can spit out an infinite number of images - wouldn&#39;t similar prompts and data sources eventually produce visually overlapping results? Would two AI generator users have to get in a legal fist fight? Would the person who typed the prompt first be the original creator? Would you have to copyright a prompt sentence? Should people generate as many images as possible and copyright those as rapidly as possible? This seems like an infinite can of worms and could be nipped in the bud if these generated pieces aren&#39;t able to hold copyright. The prompters aren&#39;t actually the creator - the algorithm is. It can be guided, and programmed, but the end results aren&#39;t humanmade beyond what was stolen. If an image has Midjourney, DALL&middot;E 2, etc. in any part of it&#39;s creation, it should forfeit the right to copyright as a safeguard to those whose work was taken without consent.   <br/><br/>I hope you can help protect the future of human artists. <br/>If AI generators were meant to &quot;democratize the arts&quot;- AI generations should be free for all to use, with no one true owner, and no copyright. <br/>Thank you for your time and opening the floor to comments. <br/><br/>Please consider contacting the illustrator Karla Ortiz, as she has a wealth of knowledge on this subject (and how negatively AI effects artists) <br/>
