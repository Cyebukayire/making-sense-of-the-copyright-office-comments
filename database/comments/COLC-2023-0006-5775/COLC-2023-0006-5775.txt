I studied at the University of Southern Mississippi through the years of 2014 -2019 and graduated with a Bachelors of Fine Arts degree with an emphasis in graphic design. Throughout my entire academic career, my professors emphasized the importance of taking inspiration from other artists rather than plagiarizing their work. It was an offense that was punishable by expulsion. Though at the time, AI art was not as prevalent, we were made aware of means through which potential clients could purchase &ldquo;stock logos&rdquo; and other designs. While these design alternatives posed a concern to myself and my peers as additional competition in our field - specifically, by offering clients cheaper, cookie-cutter options, meaning my peers would need to lower their prices to compete, or work harder to convince clients their work was worth the investment - AI generated art threatens artist on a much more personal basis. Suppose a potential client wanted a logo designed by me, but decided my pricing for the services, which I set based on the amount of work and the scope of the project, wasn&rsquo;t in their price range. That client could easily browse through my portfolio and collect examples of my work, include that in their AI training, and have a logo &ldquo;designed&rdquo; by me. I&rsquo;ve seen similar situations happen with voice actors whose voices have been quite literally &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; by AI and used for commercial products, with those actors receiving 0 compensation. <br/>AI art should not be protected under copyright in the same way plagiarized works should not be protected by copyright, and any unauthorized use of another person&rsquo;s work, without their explicit permission should not be allowed in any way.
