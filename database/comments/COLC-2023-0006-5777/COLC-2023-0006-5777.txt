A lot of people are probably writing in messages about plagiarism and the ethics of AI that are better than anything I&#39;m going to write, so instead I&#39;m going to focus on another side of it: how it is going to affect our media long term. I think it might be easy to underestimate just how much impact AI is going to have on our culture and art if not regulated. And it&#39;s going to be for the worse.<br/><br/>Right now, AI created visual art is more or less one cultural cycle ahead of most other forms of AI because of how easy it is to use and how people are using it, and something curious and is happening: in some ways AI is getting worse at producing art instead of better. As people train the algorithms on more and more AI generated art, the AI is starting to produce homogenized art as it copies itself. It&#39;s a snake eating its own tail, with a potential end result being everything looking largely the same in an incredibly boring way. <br/><br/>Under American capitalism, companies are incentivized to maximize profit wherever possible and cutting the jobs of artists for AI is money saved. This is already reason enough to pump the brakes here (replacing a real human being with Hyper Plagiarism Bot 9000 is already both morally and ethically dubious) but the long term ramifications are that, as a culture, our art and media becomes dramatically less interesting as AI learns from its own work and produces an infinite cycle of the same stories, same pieces of art, same songs, all just wearing slightly different hats.<br/><br/>Not only are the economic ramifications of AI terrible for artists, the future of AI art for the rest of us is pretty bleak. The law needs to catch up on this because companies exist to make profit and they will be completely unable to help themselves with a carrot like this dangled in front of them. <br/><br/>I&#39;m not saying AI will kill art or anything hyperbolic like that, but it would really suck if all of the companies with deep pockets that used to fund interesting and compelling mainstream art instead just began producing meaningless regurgitated nothing created by an AI algorithm, at the expense of genuine living artists who have had their work stolen to make it happen in the first place. Art is our culture, and I don&#39;t want to hand it over to the whims of an algorithm being piloted by the greediest, laziest people imaginable.
