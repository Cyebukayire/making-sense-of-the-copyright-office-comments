AI must be regulated. People are using it to make real people&#39;s livelihoods obsolete. Skills they&#39;ve spent their entire lives honing are being stolen from them. AI generated content is removing the soul from the arts. It&#39;s even stealing people&#39;s personal, physical voices from them. As things are, strangers can feed someone&#39;s physical voice into a learning machine without that person&#39;s consent or even knowledge. It&#39;s unethical on every level. We are tired of our voices and livelihoods being taken from us to be put to uses that no one even wants, by people who have no rights to use these stolen resources. Enough is enough. Let common sense and human decency be the way of our world again.
