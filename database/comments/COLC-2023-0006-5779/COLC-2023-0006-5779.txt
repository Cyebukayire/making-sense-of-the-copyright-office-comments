I&#39;m an independent animator and illustrator, and seeing as companies&#39; use of AI art could severely impact my livelihood (why pay an artist for illustrations when you can get soulless imitations that shuffle zombie-like through the uncanny valley for free?), I&#39;ve got a good bit of skin in this game. But it doesn&#39;t just cut into contractors&#39; business; it steals the hard work artists have posted online, and if we make a point of denouncing art theft, it&#39;ll be easier for those artists to get the recognition and support they deserve. I believe AI-generated works shouldn&#39;t be copyrightable unless human beings had a direct hand in their creation, since the entire point of copyright is to protect the works of human beings in the first place.
