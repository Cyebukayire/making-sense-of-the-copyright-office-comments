-AI in the creative field is an automaton.<br/><br/>You can type &quot;kitten looking cute under the rain&quot; and pat yourself on the back for creating something because you made somes choices. But did you really?<br/>Without you noticing it choosed the colors, the light, the composition, the percepective and so much more details that you barely noticed.<br/>Even if you tried to control those aspects, you won&#39;t get what you had in mind since this machine is unreliable.<br/>The best exemple is midjourney, you type &quot;average girl&quot; and all you get are supermodel, because the AI has been feed so many photos of pretty girls, and has been asked so much time to make these kind of pictures it cannot give you back an average looking girl anymore. It&#39;s called overtraining and it&#39;s a big problem.<br/><br/>-Generative AI is a slot machine not a computer art program.<br/><br/>-AI is the death of creative talents.<br/>Masters of their crafts are good at what they make because they worked hard, everyday, just to become better. They had the time to work that much because they were paid to do so. If human aren&#39;t paid to create 8 hours a day, then they won&#39;t create 8 hours a day anymore, and if they don&#39;t their skills won&#39;t improve to a professional level.<br/><br/>But we still need money to eat, so those artists will have to get jobs in others fields and will only be able to create on the week-end if they&#39;re lucky.<br/>As much as I respect all artists, there is a real big skill difference between a professional and someone who only get to paint once or twice a week.<br/>This is the death of learning for a lot more fields than just art.<br/><br/>-If we don&#39;t have time to learn those skills anymore, should we replace them with an unreliable machine, which makes choices for you?<br/>-Should we allow AI in fullfilling carriers? That should be our goals and dreams, not be replaced by robots so we can all have jobs in manuals labors.
