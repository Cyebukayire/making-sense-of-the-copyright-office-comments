I am both a professional illustrator who works in the comic book industry, as well as a senior-level UX designer in the tech industry. I&#39;ve discussed AI extensively with my professional peers in both realms. I believe, with some basic copyright laws, that AI *can* become a powerful and ethical tool in the art and tech fields. <br/><br/>Here are the following ways in which I think copyright *needs* to be applied to AI:<br/><br/>- A creator&#39;s work *should not* be able to be put into a data training set without that creator&#39;s *explicit* permission. Just like in any other instance (such as a company wanting to use a creator&#39;s artwork) if you want to use a creator&#39;s work for ANY purpose, then you should need explicit permission. This should be extended to cover using an artists&#39; work in a data training set.<br/>- Included in this &quot;explicit permission&quot; agreement would be usage agreements; creators would have to be able to put limits around how their art/style is used, both in terms of what content is generated (ex: &quot;no nazi imagery&quot;) as well as market usage (ex: &quot;can only be used for private commissions; cannot be used for commercial purposes&quot;) and how much work can be produced (ex: &quot;only 50 images per month&quot;).<br/>- Work resulting from an AI model can *only* be copyrighted by a individual/company when there is an explicit work-for-hire contract in place. After all, if an artist creates art for Disney in a work-for-hire contract, Disney can copyright that work. But if John Smith creates a commissioned artwork for Stephen Jones, Stephen may own the art, but he cannot claim that he authored John Smith&#39;s artwork. <br/>- To facilitate the copyright process, every piece of AI-generated art needs to have a clear, unalterable metadata file of what AI generator was used to create it, and what artists were included in that training data set. To not have this metadata file included in the artwork should be copyright infringement.<br/><br/>Once these rules are in place, we can have the following *ethical* uses of AI:<br/><br/>- There can be *explicitly* fair-use, open data training sets that AI generators can ethically use. <br/>- A company that uses an AI generator can *license* creators&#39; work to add to their data training sets. And then they can create whatever contracts they want with those creators to share degrees of credit and profits.<br/>- A creator can have their own AI generator trained exclusively on a data training set of their own work (along with public training sets, to cover basic visual anatomy or textual grammar etc) to generate commissions, license out their style to company AI generators, and generally raise the quantity of work they are able to produce. <br/>- Creators can come together to put their work into shared data training sets and AI generators, to generate new collaborative works under new collective names/companies.<br/><br/>There&#39;s no reason why AI can&#39;t be an ethical tool that helps progress creators&#39; reach and careers; basic copyright laws that can be natural extensions of the laws already in place in most creative industries will get us there.
