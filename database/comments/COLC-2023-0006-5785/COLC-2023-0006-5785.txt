Artificially generated images at their core are not inherently malicious; with clear permission from all the rightful owners of content being used to train a model, this technology has genuine promise in beneficial use. However, this raises an issue when the content being used for development is used without permission and almost never with any amount of transparency or even a clear option to opt out. As well, the output of this kind of malicious training has been shown to be used for purposes of fraud or scamming, whether in the case of advertising freelance services in which the examples provided were generated and based on existing art for monetary gain, or simply by companies or individuals to circumvent the cost of hiring a real freelance or contract artist for their services. In short, AI is not necessarily evil, however it *must* be regulated to a greater degree and must be held to a strict no-copyright and no-infringement policy.
