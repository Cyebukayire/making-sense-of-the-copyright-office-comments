Current AI models are too exploitative and preying on others creative works. It literally just glorified stealing/plagiarism with a fancy mask on so that the public doesn&#39;t see the ugly side of it. I wish AI to be regulated and has strict laws so that it is not used to be trained on creators. It is destroying and bringing actual harm to everyone for a quick buck. I do not support AI (I don&#39;t want to call it AI because it&#39;s an insult to call it AI when it&#39;s blatant a plagiarism tool).
