As a photographer looking to step into the professional scene, A.I. generated content is very troubling to me. The potential effects of A.I. must given careful consideration. I personally believe A.I. generated content should not be protected by copyright law. Many generation models often used scrapped content form the internet without regard for copyright. It simply isn&#39;t acceptable to allow such thievery to be permitted and protected.
