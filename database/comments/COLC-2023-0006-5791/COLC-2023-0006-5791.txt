AI hurts artists across all fields in the creative spectrum. It steals work and creates poorly rendered, half-baked creations, robbed entirely of the life and spirit that is necessary for art. It steals jobs from skilled professionals. It should not be allowed to place a copyright on AI &quot;work,&quot; because it is not original; it&#39;s stolen.
