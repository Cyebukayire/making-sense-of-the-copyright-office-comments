The workers in the arts industry are losing their jobs and homes due to AI interference. Some Writing AI programs and Art AI programs steal data from writers and artists without their consent in order to pump out forms of art using these artists&#39; works. It is plagiarism as the AI programs do not provide proper credit of the original works used. All publicly shared artworks and writing pieces are immediately scanned and put into some AI systems. No artist or writer gets a say in this. The user is then given writing or art with a prompt that directly steals data from artists&#39; work. These AI pieces are then allowed claimed as their own and free for distribution. In practice, AI technology takes years of skill in artists&#39; and writers&#39; pieces just to mash it all together into a piece of &quot;art&quot; that is then used for money. It is unfair to every artist and writer and needs to be put to a stop, or enforced to make it less harmful to the arts industries.
