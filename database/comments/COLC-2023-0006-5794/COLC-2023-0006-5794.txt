In my thoughts the current situation around &quot;AI&quot; usage is that it is extremely dangerous and is poised to ruin many art forms and media. The prevailing thought that the users of AI programs are &quot;creating&quot; anything at all with these programs is incorrect as all these programs do is scrape data from other people&#39;s creations and blend them together or otherwise work by sampling existing works. As it currently stands most uses of AI programs to produce art is done without permission from anyone these programs scrape data from and as such is theft and redistribution and further more the developers of these programs are working to thawrt any attempts of people protecting their works or media.<br/><br/>How I see these AI programs and their users is as a danger to many things, and I would strongly advocate for either their ban, or to be labled as digital toys with no ability to monetize. Heavy regulation is needed.
