AI generated images are an unregulated way to do data laundering with copywrited art, photography and videos without any consent or compensation for their original artist. The &quot;training&quot; system for generative AI is just a really complex algorithmic way to do plagiarism without leaving a trace(cause there is no database left to before the training), so since the actually AI tech can&#39;t make proof about what content is used for training, it can&#39;t be considered as and original copyrighted material in any way. Creatives are suffering the consequences of this unregulated tech in an uncountable ways.
