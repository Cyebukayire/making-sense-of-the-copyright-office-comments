AI generated content is misnamed. In reality, it is stolen or scraped content that is rescrambled in such a way to hide its true authors and provide profit for those who couldn&#39;t create this content on their own. It devalues work of all kinds, putting ill-gotten money into the pockets of those who have finally figured out a way to &quot;create&quot; art they couldn&#39;t before.<br/><br/>The last 20 years have proven that new technologies profit from swift proliferation. Tech giants call this &quot;disruption.&quot; We&#39;ve seen the collapse of many an industry because the government couldn&#39;t regulate their activity before it became widespread and commonplace. This cannot happen here. This kind of content generation (theft) needs strict and immediate regulation to protect the people it steals from.
