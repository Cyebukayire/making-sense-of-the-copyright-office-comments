Please protect the legal rights of artists and creative professions, not the right of companies to abuse us.<br/><br/>The most fundamental problem with AI, and of allowing it to be copyrighted, is that it encourages, allows and strengthens the ability for large corporations and individuals to circumvent artists, writers, actors, voice actors, movie makers, animators and creatives of all professions - for no other reason than pure greed. Legally greenlighting the flagrant use of stolen, surreptitiously acquired data, biometrics, copyrighted materials such as art, audio and other expressions of the human soul - to make money, and to then also copyright the stolen material as their own is a violation of not just american and human rights, but of everything that makes us who we are as a species. <br/><br/>I humbly ask that you look at the sort of arguments being made for AI, here and in the media space and the people submitting those arguments - and you will find that they are corporate or monetary interests advocating for things like &quot;improving&quot; &quot;enhancing&quot; and &quot;allowing&quot;. Against this stand the very existence of creative professions. We are not helped by this technology, no matter how it is being spun. We are threatened, and so is ultimately the interests of the american public, and the american government.<br/><br/>Corporations, Industries and Conmen alike can ALL thrive and make massive profits without AI. <br/>Artists, Musicians, Actors, Writers... Cannot exist with it. We NEED your legal protection, now more than ever. Please. This one time do not desert us but take a firm stance against the hollowing of copyright law. Remember what it was once conceived to do, and contemplate how it has gradually been turned into a weapon wielded only by the legal departments of enormous corporations, usually against individuals - sometimes the very individuals that should have been holding the copyright.<br/><br/>media generated by machine argorithms, especially using stolen or surreptitiously gathered data, should NOT be copyrightable. We may not &quot;be able to put the genie back in the bottle&quot; but we CAN strongly and clearly regulate its abuse. Just like we did with nuclear weapons, with human cloning, and biological warfare. Laws are here to protect the citizens. Copyright is to protect the creators. Not the rights of someone who bought a &quot;copyright breaker machine&quot;.
