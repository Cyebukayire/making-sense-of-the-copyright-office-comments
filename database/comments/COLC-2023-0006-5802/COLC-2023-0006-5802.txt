When humans learn, we read books, observe the world around us, and internalize new concepts, ideas and meanings without asking for explicit permission. This process of learning from existing works is crucial for both individuals and societies to progress and build upon the knowledge and creative works of past generations.<br/><br/>AI training functions in an analogous way. By exposing AI systems to large quantities of copyrighted text, images, audio and more, researchers are essentially teaching algorithms to identify patterns and derive meaning, just as humans do through reading. This process of instruction does not re-use copyrighted works in an infringing way any more than a human internalizing and remembering ideas from books would be considered infringement.<br/><br/>Rather than viewing AI training as potentially infringing, I think it is best thought of as a type of learning, akin to human learning from copyrighted works. Unless AI systems are directly copying or re-distributing copyrighted content, exposing them to diverse training data should be considered non-infringing, as it allows AI to progress its capabilities just as human learners progress by observing the world around them.<br/><br/>Even if traces of copyrighted training materials remain present in the form of learned patterns or associations within an AI system, this type of lingering influence should not be considered infringement any more than the knowledge humans retain after learning is infringement. Just as a person who has read a favorite book may unconsciously draw from ideas and passages they internalized without directly copying, an AI system trained on diverse sources will have absorbed concepts, logical connections and data points that inform its subsequent behavior, recommendations and outputs. But unless it is actively copying or re-distributing specific copyrighted content, the presence of learned influences within an AI system is analogous to the vast collection of ideas, facts and creative works that remain subtly influential in the minds of experienced humans. Defining this as a form of infringement would cast uncertainty over machine learning and human learning processes alike<br/><br/>Restricting the use of copyrighted works in AI training risks hampering further advances in AI safety, capabilities and applications across many fields such as education, healthcare, conservation and more. Before making policy changes in this area, I ask that you carefully weigh these risks and consider an approach that continues enabling responsible, non-infringing use of copyrighted works to advance this promising technology.
