AI utilizes large datasets and detects patterns in them to reproduce those patterns when given a relevant prompt. However, unlike a person, it has no ability to detect when it&#39;s reproducing something word for word, pixel for pixel, etc. This means that it&#39;s possible to accidentally plagiarize someone else&#39;s work if it was used in the dataset. This becomes even worse when you take into consideration the fact many people did not consent to having their work put into the dataset, as a lot of this data is obtained by crawling through things like social media without regard for what the original artist thought. That&#39;s not even mentioning the biggest concern: the mass adoption of AI is going to make a bunch of companies think they can get away with getting rid of workers (or just not pay them), putting thousands and potentially millions of people out of a job. See the writers&#39; and actors&#39; strikes earlier this summer, where the CEO straight up said he was going to delay to try to make them homeless.
