AI needs tighter restrictions in regards to how it&#39;s data is trained because as it exists now, everything AI creates is only possible through stolen artwork and music. The artwork and music used to train current modern AI was used without permission and even features watermarks in the trained artwork. It should be illegal to use any of this work in a professional setting UNLESS the AI is house trained and ONLY uses artwork that was expressively permitted to be allowed for the training. AIs that don&#39;t use artwork SPECIFICALLY permitted for AI use are directly violating copyright rules.
