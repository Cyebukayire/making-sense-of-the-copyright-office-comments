Hello, I am an artist of a small business involved with character merchandising. Artists who draft with a brush or pen whether that is digital or traditional take the time and skills to interpret inspirations by work of study from contemporary and past artists to create something individualistic. Even though we may mimic, a sense of ourselves can still be seen through our work by our tendencies and tastes and that shows through the design language of our shape, color, proportion and texture. The concern that I have with Artificial Intelligence and Copyright is how ambiguous and deceptive some of these Artificial Intelligence businesses can be about where they source images to train their artificial intelligence or claim about copyright without actually having the sampling of copyrighted work being consented to being used or with a contactable agreement. A lot of them, run a subscription based platform where most of financial gain is achieved by the Artificial Intelligence creators without contracts or royalties to copyrighted material. Artificial Intelligence despite its nuanced limitations can be dangerous without guardrails because of the scale it can be applied and the misinformation some of businesses formed around it are claiming about copyright. If we allow artificial intelligence or generative art to bypass sources of copyright, without royalties, it undermines the weight of claims and authority that the U.S Copyright could enforce to protect US based entertainment industries. Lets innovate, but with guidelines to protect emerging American individuals and businesses, without it being a free for all to scrape and benefit off the back of the others as quickly as possible. Thank you for your time.
