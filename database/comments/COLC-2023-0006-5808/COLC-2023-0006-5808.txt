AI uses real life peoples work, voices, and art to make mockeries of the form and then monetizes off of others work without credit or compensation. Additionally it creates competition for these people&rsquo;s livelihoods and profits off of theft. There should not be copyright for these acts of theft and monetization of theft and there should be more protection given to those who&rsquo;s work was used by AI to generate these images, from which the original artist did not give permission to do so in the first place.
