AI has been shown multiple times to use already copyrighted human artwork and writing without permission. Allowing the works created in this way to be copyrighted will make it possible for the users of the AI to make money off what is essentially stolen art. <br/><br/>AI writing and art does not credit its sources. Some AI art is obviously and directly copied from its sources with few changes made. AI art and writing engines regularly copyrighted materials from websites where authors explicitly forbid their work to be used without credit. <br/><br/>Until AI is created that is designed to respect the legal rights of the creators of the work it uses as data, no copyright on it is ethical or legal. <br/><br/>
