Hello  My name is Sophia and I have been a long time creative. I am most skilled in digital illustration and I have been an active art appreciator for many years. I have major concerns over how AI has been making more significant developments in image generating, posited as art, in recent years. AI needs data input in order to generate output. In the case of AI image &amp; art generation, the data input is pre-existing, non-AI art. In other words, images and designs created &amp; owned by artists, who can claim copyright over those images. Just as musicians must license samples from even the smallest strings of music owned by other musicians, honest &amp; legally abiding creators (including AI creators) should honor the data input that they make use of when creating their products. The main concern I have is the complete lack of control artists and creators who have their images used by artificial intelligence to legally protect their work &amp; copyrights. Not only are images for data input scraped from online images without artists&#39; permission or knowledge either before or after the fact, but no effort is made to credit artists or license work, as copyright laws would necessitate. As new technologies develop, it is important and necessary that governments reflect the needs of their populus, and protect and serve them by creating legal infrastructure and guidelines on how technologies can be safely used for the benefit of the government&#39;s populus. Action on part of the United States government will protect the interests of small-scale artists and large media companies alike in the protection of their image assets from the threats that AI can present.
