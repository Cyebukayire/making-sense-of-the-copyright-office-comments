Generative AI is harmful to all creative industries, and to the general public. Designers, retouches, visual effects, all lose business and income due to this technology. The general public suffers because this technology is used in facial recognition and has been known to make errors, especially on non-Caucasian subjects. As for copyrighting, artists need to be compensated for their work, period. Generative AI scrapes and basically steals artist&rsquo;s work without compensating the artist. Personally, I think all artists should be retroactively compensated if their work was used to teach AI. Or was used in any way without permission.
