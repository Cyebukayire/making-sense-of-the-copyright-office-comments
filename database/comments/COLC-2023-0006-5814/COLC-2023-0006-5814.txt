Generative Artificial Intelligence has become a danger for the employment of thousands, if not millions of individuals not only in the United States but also across the globe. It has become imperative to not only regulate all the companies involved in any current or upcoming models not only due to any potential risks it carries with themselves (from copyright infringement to infringement of privacy of practically everybody, including children) but also the risks for the general population they may bring as loss of employment, insufficient and/or inadecuate treatment of oficial documents, identity theft in social media and/or official documents, inadequate medical treatments, fabricated criminal acts. fabricated false news, blackmail and other forms of scam, as well as any other risks not specified in this comment. What is worst, these consequences if gAI had and still affect other countries, some of which are already taking steps, therefore, more observation and action should take place so gAI does not become a problem of the many just for the benefit of a couple few.
