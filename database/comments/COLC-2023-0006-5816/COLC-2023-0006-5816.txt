AI should not be copyright-able, and should not be able to use copyrighted materials to train on. Companies should not be able to train their AI using content on the internet. With many works, people pour their hearts and souls into what they post, and nobody you be able to take the work of others and feed it into an algorithm to have it changed against their wishes, without any sort of compensation, to be used to make a quick buck for a corporation. If a normal citizen were to take a work that is produced on a streaming service, changed it slightly, and then sold it for a profit, we would be sued at a minimum. So why should a corporation be able to take an individuals work and do the same without repercussions, just because it&#39;s a computer program?
