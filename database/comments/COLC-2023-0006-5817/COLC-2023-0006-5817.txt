I think that ,,art&#39;&#39; made by AI applications shouldn&#39;t be copyrighted, because it takes artists art without premission. What these people are doing is just stealing things that are made by hardworking people who sometimes can&#39;t find a job. What should be done is not allowing use AI ,,art&#39;&#39; generators to make art in jobs and corporations and give that jobs to humans. Human life, ideas and experience are more valuable than going easy way for money. Art is culture, these generators already proved that pictures they ,,made&#39;&#39; are unetical, racist and sexists and people can easly use them to manipulate fasts. This is why they shouldn&#39;t be copyrighted, it will only make a harm for people. If typying few words in a generator is making generated ,,art&#39;&#39; copyrighted then we can also do that by writting these words in Google grafica and telling all the pictures there are belonging to person which writed a phrase. Please, don&#39;t try to take passion and jobs from people, this is more important for every one than people think.
