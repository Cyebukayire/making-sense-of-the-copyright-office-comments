AI is the undermining of workers and crafters everywhere. It does ireprible damage to the market economy and will cost millions of jobs. It saturates the market with derivative content that is created on the backs of working people without any compensation nor intention to compensate, and it shows a blatant disregard for privacy and security in it&#39;s use of identity theft in the form of people&#39;s face/image and their voices. AI as a tool needs to be used responsibly and restrained with strict laws. AI being free to use anything it can scrape from the internet only encourages theft of work and identity of others, including the disturbing use of under aged content. If no laws are made to make AI users responsible for their actions it will be impossible to undo the damage it does to society. Emplyment rates everywhere will suffer because of companies short sightedness. The hypothetical value of AI does not out weigh the very tangable and real damage it has already clearly done, and will continue to do if left without legal restraint.
