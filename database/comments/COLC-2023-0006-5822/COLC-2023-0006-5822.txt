AI, as it currently is being used, cannot generate it&rsquo;s own original ideas or art. Instead it steals from the hard work of millions of artists, writers, etc. Companies want to use our hard work for free. They want to steal our hard work while they kick us to the curb with no jobs to even apply for. How are we suppose to continue to live when our skill sets aren&rsquo;t valued and are being used without our permission and without pay? What are we suppose to do when the work dries up because companies want to us AI instead of humans because its cheaper? When our hard work is recycled back to us as a worse product? Is human contribution and human life not valued over a bottom line? Art is already so unvalued in this country. People don&rsquo;t view it as important yet when the pandemic hit what did everyone do to comfort themselves? They turned to art: TV shows, movies, books. It is important and it is OUR hard work. I don&rsquo;t want to live in a world where AI makes all of the &ldquo;art&rdquo; based on other people&rsquo;s hard work, or where people live in fear of making art because an AI will rip it off. What kind of a world is that?
