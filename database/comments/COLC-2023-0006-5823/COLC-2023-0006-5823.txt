AI should not be allowed to be copyrighted. The data used to train AI is outsourced to the works of others and therefore is not the AI creator&rsquo;s intellectual property. <br/>Furthermore, in order to train AI, express written consent of the creators of the content used should be legally required. There also should be clear and accessible legal recourse for those whose art or other content is used to train AI without their consent. <br/>Any product or good that uses AI should be required to disclose clearly that it is a work of AI and not of a specific person. Authors are having to fight Amazon to remove books written by AI and listed as having been written by a real human author who did not write it. It is unfair to the author whose name is being used and unfair to the consumer who is being misled about the true authorship.
