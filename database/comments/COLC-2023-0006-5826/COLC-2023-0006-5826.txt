I&#39;m an artist in animation industry, and it&#39;s alarming for me to see so many artists&#39; identity and their artworks being stolen by AI companies and using them without consent nor compensation. This not just unethical and destroying copyright laws, but also creating unfair competition in the marker, and they are exploiting intellectual properties for money without bother about the risks of putting so many people out of jobs. The wealth gap between those who have the authority, money and technology is driving others to enslavement and ruining their life. And more AI technology are coming soon, even much better than what is already on the market now. We all desperate need regulation to limit the abuse of power, to protect people, to protect jobs, and to protect humanity. Technology innovation is inevitable at this modern time, and it should be serve to help our life better, but the reality it&#39;s like giving nuclear weapons to wrong hands and plenty mediocre people will seek a way to abuse it. If we don&#39;t regular now, the society will crash very soon, especially when people losing the humane and purpose.
