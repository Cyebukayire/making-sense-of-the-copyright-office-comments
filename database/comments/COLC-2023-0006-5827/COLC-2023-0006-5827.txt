AI generative &#39;art&#39; pieces are created using information scraped from real people&#39;s artwork, without permission. Companies have been aiming to use generative content to replace real people&#39;s talents and hard work. If they are allowed to do this and claim the work as their protected property, it would destroy thousands of people&#39;s livelihoods as they&#39;re slowly replaced by soulless amalgamations of &#39;art.&#39; Everything that image generators spit out is built on stolen property, and should not be able to be protected by copyright.
