I believe Generative AI programs need to be heavily regulated and artists need to be protected. While there are definitely a few ethical ways AI can help artists speed up their workflow (for example, the Cadmium animation tool), its current implementation is actively hurting artists by scraping their work without their consent or any compensation. With applications like Adobe Photoshop adding Generative AI training tools into its program with the user having to manually Opt Out themselves, instead of Opt In by choice, it may potentially jeopardize any projects under NDA. <br/><br/>Moreover, this type of emerging technology has lead to a complete and total disrespect and contempt towards artists by both corporations and the public. Artists are not only being laid off and replaced, but have also been subjected to cyberbullying by AI Advocates on the internet for voicing their concerns and speaking out against their work being used for training these AI models. It&#39;s disheartening to see, especially as someone who has dreamed of having a career in the creative field. <br/><br/>Animation, Visual Development, Graphic Design, and all other creative endeavors are valid careers. All of them need to be protected. We need stronger copyright laws to protect artists and ensure that those like myself who grew up dreaming of having an artistic job don&#39;t lose face in this ever-changing technological landscape. Like I said, there are ethical ways to implement AI into the artists workflow, and I know that it is helpful in other fields like computer programming, but to completely eradicate all creative jobs is appalling. Creatives and Artists deserve to have a say in what is best for their careers, not people who have no experience in the field whatsoever.
