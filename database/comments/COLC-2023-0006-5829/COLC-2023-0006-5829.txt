I agree that Ai generated art it theft of the work of artists. Ai cannot be inspired by, reference to, or pay omage to the work of artists because when an artist are inspired, reference, or pay omage to the work of other artists the artist is still producing they&#39;re own original ideas and thoughts. If an artist completely recreated the work of another artist without their own ideas or thoughts added to it and tried to sell the work as an original piece it would theft. If an artist copied multiple other artists for one work without their own ideas or thoughts and tried to sell it as and original it would still be theft. Even in cases of which an artist adds their own thoughts and ideas to works that were inspired by, reference to, pay omage to works of other artists where the works is too similar to pieces that inspired it with enough original work to make it unique the artist can be found guilty of theft. <br/>An Ai can not think nor create original ideas, all Ai can do is copy (cutting, pasting, and stitching if you will) the original works of artists. It was never acceptable for artists to do this, it should not be acceptable for an Ai to do this. <br/>Ai largely copy from the works of artist online, where the artist may not be aware that their art is being stolen at all or are don&#39;t have the resources to do much if anything about the theft. Artists being unaware or unable to do anything about the theft when it happens does change the fact that it is still theft.<br/><br/>It is only the fact that large companies don&#39;t want to pay artists is largely the reason why this clear theft is in question  at all. Companies would rather use an Ai(something that doesn&#39;t argue or required much if any payment) rather that work with an artist(s), living people capable of arguing how much the time and skills are worth. SAG-AFTRA is striking at this time for this exact reason.<br/><br/>On a more human/personal note, I would ask that person or people that read my comment to think about how they dealt with or passed their time during the global pandemic; if you passed that time reading books, watching movies or TV show, or playing video games, think about which you personally enjoy the most and check if it was made by artist or an Ai, and decided from that if you want future art to be made by artist or Ai.
