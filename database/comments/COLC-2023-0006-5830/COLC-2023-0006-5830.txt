A.I. needs to be extremely regulated.<br/>The fact that anyone can use this technology to not only steal someone&rsquo;s work but create fictitious content using anyone&rsquo;s likeness without permission goes against everything this country is supposed to stand for.  A.I. is violating our human rights, our freedom of speech and expression.  It is intellectual property theft!<br/>Corporate greed will stop at nothing to exploit this technology which could result in the loss of thousands of American jobs.  It will hurt our economy.
