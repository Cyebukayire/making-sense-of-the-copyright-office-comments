&quot;Ai&quot; generation tools are an attempt to monopolize the creative industry whilst committing blatant theft of copyrighted works and private information,<br/>the tools themselves bring no new value it&#39;s simply a Data-laundering scheme. Despite the claims there has been no significant proof of these tools being intelligent or showing signs of &quot;learning&quot; if left unchecked the creative industry WORLD-WIDE will cease to exist Millions to be left without work and individual freedoms will be eroded.<br/><br/>Please regulate these tools our works and private data are not playthings to be used against us.
