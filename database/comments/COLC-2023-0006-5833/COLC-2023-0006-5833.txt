The purpose of copyright is to ensure that creators are able to make a living off their work. That work takes time, effort, thought, and execution.  With AI, however, it is trivial to train a model to generate infinite possibilities with no effort - the unit cost of new works drops to zero. Because of this, I do not see what purpose copyright protection for AI works would serve aside from infinite protection for infinite assets.  This goes against the spirit of the concept of copyright.<br/><br/>I have, myself, built algorithmic image generators going back to 2006.  But I recognize that the copyright, in that case, was on the code I wrote (rightly protected by copyright), not in the output which were generated algorithmically.  I am also a traditional painter, and I expect for those works to receive protection.<br/><br/>Beyond providing copyright to AI-generated images or text, I am concerned with the wholesale scraping and training of models from data on the web.  I would much prefer a system where AI models are trained on license or opt-in systems.  I post my paintings to the Internet for people to see, but I do not consent to wholesale harvesting of images to build models that are generating other images.  As it stands, my consent means nothing.<br/><br/>No to AI image copyright.  Yes to copyright protections for model training data.
