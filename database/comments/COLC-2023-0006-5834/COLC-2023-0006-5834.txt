I think AI may not be good for the entertainment industry. It may be good for editing and suggesting how to make scripts better, but it won&rsquo;t be good writing it itself. I think what AI will do is analyze what made box office smashes a success and copy from the. It is only good in analyzing. Besides, replacing with AI will only open the companies to more hacking.
