Generative AI models are trained by using massive amounts of content from real creators without their consent. Without the millions of pieces of music, literature, and art that these creators had already produced, the AI would be completely unable to function. As such, the value of any content generated through AI is still tied to the original artists whose creations were stolen, no matter how much time the AI user spends fiddling with the program to get the generation they want. If nobody else had ever created art before, a true artist could still create art all of their own. However, an &quot;AI artist&quot; is completely unable to produce work without leeching off of the accomplishments of others. In my view, this completely violates the principle of originality in copyright eligibility, meaning that all AI-generated content should not be copyrightable. The only exception to this I can think of would be if all of the content in the AI&#39;s database is also under the copyright of the AI user, but as of now, none of the popular generative AI models have such homogenous databases.
