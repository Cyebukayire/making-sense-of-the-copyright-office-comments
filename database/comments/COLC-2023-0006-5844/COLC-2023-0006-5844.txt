Artificial Intelligence needs be regulated. Artificial Intelligence generates images by scraping images and art works without the consent of the original creator or owner. Artificial Intelligence needs be regulated to only utilize works from consenting individuals and corporations. As we have already established in previous copyright laws in the United States, simply posting an artwork or image online does not allow anyone to use the artwork or image however they please. Case in point, the Disney logo. Anyone can find it online but anyone who does not want to get sued would never dare to use it with the company&#39;s explicit permission. Artificial Intelligence can not be allowed an exception to that. Artificial Intelligence has been unregulated for several months now and many individuals have sited that their work was directly scraped without permission by AI. If Disney&#39;s copyright is reinforced, why is an individual&#39;s copyright not enforced? AI needs to be regulated to only utilizing works with consent from the official owner / creator.
