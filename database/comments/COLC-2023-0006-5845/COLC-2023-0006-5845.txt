AI generated media is in desperate need of regulation. In the current state of AI in society: Anyone can steal my hard work and feed it into an algorithm, completely recreate it, and claim it as their own. Anyone can replicate and use another human&#39;s face and voice and claim it to be real. Especially in today&#39;s very fast paced social landscape, there must be PREVENTION rather than the current cycle of &#39;trying to correct and inform millions of misinformed Americans&#39;. I, personally, wasn&#39;t worried much about &quot;AI taking our jobs,&quot; especially as a creative. But, to see now that not only is that exactly what&#39;s happening, but AI is aiming for ART FOCUSED JOBS???? As a society we could benefit so much from helping the already overworked labor force, but instead they are firing creatives to replace them with AI. As an artist and musician, seeing an AI being signed to record labels and all forms of media replacing teams of artists, designers and voice actors with AI...it&#39;s absolutely horrifying. The last thing I would like to make VERY clear, AI are not sentient. They cannot develop emotions and have human experiences, both aforementioned being CRUCIAL to making art. I, also, think it&#39;s very dystopian to have computers making our learning, entertainment and creative decisions for us. Humans are begging to do art, please regulate AI to be used where it is NEEDED.
