Generative algorithms pose a dire threat not just to artistic professions but our civilization as a whole. Art is the oldest and most effective tool of communication that can transcend languages and cultures, and spread meaningful ideas and feelings between people. This process requires a human&#39;s cumulative years of lived experience and personal touch, something &quot;AI&quot; does not have. Generative AI models outright steal the time and experience of actual creators and regurgitate it in a home, meaningless, and often dangerous way. Not only will it put millions of artists out of work which harms lives and the economy, it can be used in extremely malicious ways to create false images of real people and spread misinformation and create even further divide among the people of America and the world at large. The threats of Generative &quot;AI&quot; are very significant and we are at a crucial crossroad where the problem can be dealt with right now before it gets out of hand. It must be heavily regulated to ensure it doesn&#39;t cause harm.
