As an Illustrator and Graphic Designer, I feel that generative AI imagery should be more heavily restricted, as there are grounds for it to be considered plagiarism or otherwise infringing on copyright. The main issue myself and others in my field have raised is that many of the copyright holders whose content has been used in generative algorithms have not given express permission for the work to be used as part of the generative dataset. This is frequently seen as infringement of intellectual property, if not outright theft. Plagiarism is also a main concern among those working in visual arts, with many feeling that it is unfair for work generated by algorithm to be exempt from the same laws as work created by hand. Many are calling for AI-generated imagery to be unable to be copyrighted, frequently citing the case of Naruto v. David Slater et al as a comparable example of work made by a non-human entity as exempt from copyright.<br/>
