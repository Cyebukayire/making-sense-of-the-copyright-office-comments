Yes. There should be copyrights in regard to AI. If it uses someone&#39;s artwork, there should at least be credit towards the artist. the actual person who made the assets that the AI unknowingly stole from. If the project has AI and is being paid for its creation, the artist should get a portion of it, too. Or have permission to prevent people from using it altogether.
