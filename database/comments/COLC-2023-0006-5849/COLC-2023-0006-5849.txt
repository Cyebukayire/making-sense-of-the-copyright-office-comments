I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in collecting public feedback on this important matter. I am an artist whose living depends on being able to monetize and maintain rights to my own work. My livelihood is being threatened by large learning models, otherwise known as generative &ldquo;AI&rdquo;. There already exists a strong policy to promote the arts by allowing authors and creators exclusive rights to their creative works during a set period of time. While said works are under copyright, it&rsquo;s clear that use in generative &ldquo;AI&rdquo; without the author or creators consent violates the already established exclusive rights protected under copyright law. <br/><br/>We ask that the Copyright Office take a clear stance that training generative &ldquo;AI&rdquo; on copyrighted works without the consent of authors and creators of those works violates the Copyright Act. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.
