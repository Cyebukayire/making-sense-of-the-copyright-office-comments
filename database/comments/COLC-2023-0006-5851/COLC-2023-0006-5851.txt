I&#39;m a fiction writer. I have a BS in Computer Science. <br/>I feel extremely confident in the statement that so-called &quot;generative&quot; AI is nothing but a thin veneer of respectability placed over blatant theft. There is nothing I&#39;ve seen (from the perspective of a programmer or as an artist) that implies it to be anything but. The only reason that we&#39;re even having the debate as to whether it is or is not theft is that the software is able to do so much plaigarism, and from so many sources, that it can become difficult to tell where precisely it&#39;s coming from. That makes the technology more of a problem, not less, because the people using it cannot even attempt to credit the sources that were cobbled together to create the garbage it spews out. In addition, the fact that its authors and users seem entirely intent on putting literally every single instance of written text that they can find (copyrighted or not, made for free or made for profit, official or informal) into these language models without even bothering to ask their original authors, says everything one needs to know about how much respect they have for intelligent property and for copyright.<br/>They want to profit off of writing that they do not want to make, or to pay someone else to make. This whole trend is nothing more than a poorly-disguised attempt to never pay any writer again and to make awful, borderline incomprehensible &quot;art&quot; from stolen works because they think they can get away with profiting from it.<br/><br/>Please, as an artist and a programmer, do not let them.
