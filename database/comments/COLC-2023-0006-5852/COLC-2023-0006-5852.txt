I am writing in opposition to stringent copyright enforcement when it comes to Artificial Intelligence (AI). My perspective on this matter stems from the firsthand experience I have garnered as a medical professional, where I&#39;ve seen the powerful impact AI can have on patient care.<br/><br/>Over the past three years, AI tools have been integrated into my medical practice. These tools have not only transformed the care I provide but have directly contributed to saving lives. At our institution, AI has been instrumental in saving the lives of several patients and has enhanced treatment for hundreds. Such numbers are only a fraction of what is possible on a global scale if AI tools are more widely adopted and continually improved.<br/><br/>While I understand and respect the importance of intellectual property rights, an overly aggressive copyright regime can inadvertently act as a roadblock. Companies and innovators might be deterred from creating or refining AI tools due to fear of copyright infringements. The result is not just a loss for the tech industry, but a potential impediment to saving lives and advancing medical care.<br/><br/>The potential of AI to transform industries, especially healthcare, is immeasurable. Our regulations, including copyright laws, should be aligned in a manner that facilitates AI advancements rather than stifling them.<br/><br/>I urge the Copyright Office to consider a balanced approach, taking into account the greater good that AI can offer to society.
