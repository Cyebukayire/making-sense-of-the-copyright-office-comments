I am a software professional with 15 years in the industry. I have a working knowledge of US copyright law, due to its importance in software licensing and especially the &quot;open source&quot; movement.<br/><br/>The recent explosion of generative artificial intelligence software uses a technique called &quot;machine learning&quot; (ML). A set of training data (original works) is used as input for the software to produce a &quot;model&quot; (a mathematical summary of the input) that lets the software create similar outputs (derivative works). The degree to which any of these outputs might appear unrelated to the inputs is due only to the sheer immensity of the input. Billions of works are collected from across the Internet--almost always without the permission of their copyright holder to use for this purpose.<br/><br/>Those profiting from generative AIs trained on unscrupulously collected data are counting on 1. Lack of specific regulation and case law in this relatively new space, and 2. Difficulty of the original works&#39; authors or copyright holders to know that their work has been used.<br/><br/>I urge you to consider the following:<br/>1. Works created by ML software are inherently derivative of their training data.<br/>2. Without transparent documentation of the sources and licenses of the training data, it can be difficult or impossible to determine when copyrights are being deliberately infringed.<br/>3. Standard licenses that are otherwise broadly permissive but pre-date the recent commoditzation of ML software should not be assumed to permit this use of a work.<br/>4. Copyright exists foremost to protect the livelihood of creators. ML software is already being used to replace those creators by corporations who see it as a low-cost alternative to paying a license fee or commissioning a work for hire.
