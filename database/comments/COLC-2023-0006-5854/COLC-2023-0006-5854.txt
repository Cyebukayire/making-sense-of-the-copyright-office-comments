It&#39;s important to know that AI is not actually &quot;artificial intelligence.&quot; It cannot think, and anything it outputs is trained off of the word/image soup collected and compiled together to make the type of response people want. In the instance of Chat GPT, many people use the terms &quot;It lied&quot; or &quot;it hallucinated&quot; which are false. AI cannot cannot lie because it cannot think. It&#39;s responses are word soup. It simply chose a series of words and mashed them together based off of many other people&#39;s works and the words that most commonly are seen together in association with the prompt presented. it does not actually form a real statement or thought.<br/><br/>This is important to keep in mind going forward. <br/><br/>What is also important to know is that ALL of the systems currently in place are based off of copyright material and trained without consent. You cannot use a person&#39;s work for your own copyright material. ex: a selfie someone took does not belong to you and is not free to use however you like. A google image search can reveal a painting, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to use that painting however you wish for your work. Why should this be any different for AI?<br/><br/>The copyright office should take a clear stance on how these systems should be trained and the ways in which to prove the works used to create them are, in fact, consenting sources. It should not be allowed to simply be a &quot;self reporting&quot; situation, because in many cases we see presently a company (Adobe, for example) will claim their tool is made of only stock imagery, but can replicate an artist&#39;s work with their name. How is that possible if that artist was not ever part of the sample set of works used to train it? It isn&#39;t. AI can&#39;t think and can&#39;t know about the artist without actively being fed their work. Adobe and many other companies like it are lying about how their models are trained and and a stronger, harder stance on how they need to prove it is trained should be mandatory if they continue to sell the model as a &quot;tool.&quot;<br/><br/>Human authorship should remain the bedrock of copyright law, and as such the amount of human authorship should be substantial (meaning a majority of the work) even if (in the future) any AI system is built using consenting sources (which, currently, there are NONE). <br/><br/>Along with the arguments made above, I would like to also add the additional factor of human creativity. If you allow AI to be copyrighted, the amount of human-made art, literature, etc will plummet. The input of humans will deteriorate in many ways, and so will the quality of work. As I stated, AI is not intelligent and cannot think and cannot expand without input. We already see it faltering as it is fed it&#39;s own work back into it, and the production of monstrosities lacking any coherence is what it puts out. The models cannot sustain themselves because they aren&#39;t actually thinking and aren&#39;t people.  And it will only get worse with time.<br/><br/>If allowed to be copyrightable, that WILL become the standard of creative content you will be exposed to. Dinosaurs for children&#39;s coloring books that tell them a T-rex has human arms, a weird bird face, and 5 legs; shows and movies written entirely by machines that lack any coherence as a plot or dialogue; Fake videos of people with the faces of your friends and loved ones sold as pornography. this weird dystopian monstrosity hell-scape of computer gibberish and exploitation is not the future anyone wants, but it is already turning into the future we will unfortunately get if allowed.<br/><br/>While it is all fine and dandy to say &quot;well artists will still make art even if it isn&#39;t their job&quot; the reality is that they won&#39;t. Or that the average person will not see it at all as people who create their own content are pushed out of existence. Not to mention, people grow and expand and learn from each other which will immediately become weaker with time as they are pushed out. The vast media landscape that we have will quickly become devoid of any semblance of humanity or coherence. People who support AI love to say they support the arts, but in reality its a way to scam people and find a way to avoid paying those who have actual skills. Asking a machine to spit out soup is not a skill and requires no thought, planning, or even much input from the person asking.<br/><br/>Please don&#39;t allow AI to become copyrightable.
