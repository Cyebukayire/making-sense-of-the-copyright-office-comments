I&rsquo;m not even sure why we call this nonsense &ldquo;A.I.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t artificially intelligent, it&rsquo;s just plagiarism software.<br/><br/>While I recognize its possible uses in some fields where being able to rapidly observe and replicate patterns could be good, the application of these programs in creative fields is like a nightmare fished out of a clown toilet, and I hate it. This does not even touch upon its potential racist uses.
