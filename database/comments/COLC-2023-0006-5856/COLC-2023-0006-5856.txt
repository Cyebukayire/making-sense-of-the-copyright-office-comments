I&#39;m an artist, and I&#39;m deeply concerned about how the work of myself and my peers can be used without our consent, violating our copyright without any consequence. To me, it&#39;s thief, it jeopardizes our chance to find work, and violates what copyright was intended for, to protect and make sure creators and their work is properly protected.
