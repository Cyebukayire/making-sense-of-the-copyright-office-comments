AI generated images must not be copyrightable because of the harm they cause to real, human artists&#39; careers and because they are largely based in the unauthorized use of artists&#39; online publications. They are theft. These images are not original creations because they work by pulling art from the Internet based on the input search terms, warp the stolen artworks in a mockery of the original piece (often recognizably retaining the artists&#39; watermarks), and spit out a downloadable file. Because these images are created using concepts input into a system (which is not copyrightable), not actual human technical skill developed over years of practice, study, and/or professional applications, AI generated images cannot be considered human-made art. The person inputting the search terms did not choose the medium, the colors, the lines, the textures, the emotion behind the piece, they just blundered through strings of prompts until they stumbled into an artist (or artists) who DID consciously make those choices and create true art.
