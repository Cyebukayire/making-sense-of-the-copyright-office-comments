AI systems cannot create something out of nothing. It requires &quot;copying&quot; or &quot;emulating&quot; existing material copyrighted or otherwise into datasets and using said AI to reproduce or in this case copy numerous images as part of its learning and creative process.<br/><br/>As such AI systems cannot work without copying existing copyrighted images and/or other media to make derivates of said copyrighted material.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the advent of AI violates consent of workers who do not wish to have their intellectual property fed to a system that may directly plagiarize or profit off their intellectual property.<br/><br/>For creatives, AI also creates scenarios for unemployment, theft of labor, and violation of worker&#39;s rights.<br/><br/>AI also, in its ever-growing capacity to emulate fed existing material, can lead to multiple instances of fraud, libel, counterfeiting, and other criminal activities up to even treason or espionage.<br/><br/>Worker&#39;s rights must be respected, and any flow of further misinformation that can jeopardize social and/or national security must be investigated, halted, and terminated.<br/><br/>If not impeded, AI opens the door to either the redundancy and dissolution of copyright protection, or massive theft of intellectual property, from small to big business. Such a situation is a destruction to years of instrumental copyright law protecting businesses and independent owners and such ongoing laws and protections must be upheld.<br/><br/>To fully submit and in summation to the US Government, AI must be subject to rigorous investigation, regulation, and not authorized for commercial usage.
