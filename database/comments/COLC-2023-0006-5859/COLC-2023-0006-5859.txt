The whole thing is build on stolen content and have been gathered from everything even paid content and pornography. You can check on reddit, people makes pedophile content and pornography of people without their consent. It needs to regulate and purged from EVERY copyrighted content. It&#39;s just a quick cash - minimum efforts made from rich people to earn even more and pay less to nothing, I&#39;m strongly against.
