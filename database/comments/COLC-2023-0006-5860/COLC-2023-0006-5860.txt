In the time that generative machine learning (ML)-based image generators have been available online, there has been measurable harm to the world of professional art and the careers of professional artists across a multitude of industries. The lack of regulation on training data sets and the lack of tools that allow artists to protect themselves and their work from inclusion in ML training data opens the door for plagiarism, copyright infringement, reputational damage, and economic loss. Commercial generative AI products need regulation to disclose their training sets and allow artists to opt-out, and court cases that have determined that AI-generated images cannot be copyrighted reinforce the need for additional transparency and regulation. The proliferation of large-scale image generators is harmful to artistic industries and careers beyond the visual arts, including voice and traditional actors, writers, music and sound designers, and other industries where ML content generation is growing. Without regulation and protective toolsets, there will be undeniable damage to the fields of professional creativity and the careers of American creators.
