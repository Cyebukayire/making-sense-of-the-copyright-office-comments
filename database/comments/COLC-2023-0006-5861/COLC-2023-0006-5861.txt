Image generation using artificial intelligence has been used to imitate copyrighted material to make new content not approved by the copyright holder. Artificial intelligence software (AI) often trains its algorithms by scraping artworks and written works from the internet, more often than not doing so without the explicit consent of the artists and writers as well as not to the artists&#39; and writers&#39; knowledge. As the use of AI is often connected to the use of copyrighted material (also taking into account the use of copyrighted material to train such technologies) it is theft and/or infringement of copyright, and should be treated as such. Any content generated by AI, whether initiated by a human or not, should not be copyrightable.
