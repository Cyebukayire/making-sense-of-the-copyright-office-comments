I am a freelance artist and have been in business since 2016 producing custom commissioned content for buyers. Over the last couple of years, I have repeatedly dealt with people trying to turn my art into NFTs, and now trying to replace my business with AI work. I have watched fellow artists be driven off of platforms via harassment of AI image scrapers--one particular individual I recall being chased off is the artist Simon Stalenhag, whose work was used to train specific AI models for the sole purpose of stealing his distinctive style and replicating it. Artists are being replaced left and right by AI work, and if AI work is able to be registered for copyright, there will be nothing left to protect artists from having their content scraped, turned into new AI art, and then registered for copyrights. <br/><br/>I am of the firm belief that no broad scale image training should be permitted with AI, and certainly nothing created with such AI should be allowed to be registered for copyright. In the event that AI infringes on the rights of actual, human artists--those artists should have every recourse available to sue anyone attempting to pass off AI content as genuine examples of artwork. This is about the lives and livelihoods of the entire creative sector; we&#39;ve also been seeing AI used to generate written stories, to steal the voices of musicians, and even to create animated works. AI is not able to create new work, only to mash together things inspired by old work it was fed--artificial intelligence is not generating new content, it&#39;s simply a plagiarism machine with fancy bells and whistles. And it&#39;s endangering the livelihood of creatives everywhere. Right now, it&#39;s being used as a threat against striking actors and writers, and we&#39;ve already seen examples of movie extras having their entire body scanned so they can be replicated in films without having to hire them again. How, then, could this be anything other than willful theft of their very visage, and an attempt to drive them out of employment and force them to abandon creative careers?<br/><br/>Frankly, I believe that AI should be heavily regulated; nobody should be permitted to use large datasets without consent of every individual involved in the data set. Generative AI data scraping needs to be opt-in, not opt-out. It should be automatically assumed that nobody wants their content in the data set, and then give them the ability to give permission should they want to--that way, only artists who want their work to be used in generative AI will have it used as such. This will protect artists from having their work ripped off, but allow for consenting artists to explore AI if they feel that&#39;s right for them. <br/><br/>As for copyright, I feel that AI-produced content should only be able to be copyrighted by an individual if their art was the sole input for the generative AI model they used. So if I were to put all of my art into a model and generate more art, that should be copyrightable--but if I used anyone else&#39;s work alongside my own personal work, I should not be permitted to copyright any content that I produce, as it uses work that is derivative of others&#39; content, and is thus not my own personal content. In the event that larger models have only used the work from consenting artists, then I feel that copyright decision should be a joint decision reliant on agreement from all artists involved in the generative model. And I feel that any model that does not have the explicit, opt-in consent of 100% of their artists, should never be permitted to copyright any output whatsoever. <br/><br/>This also applies in cases of deceased artists. Nobody should be able to produce content that scrapes the art, writing, voice acting, etc of a deceased individual and then be permitted to copyright that. Deceased creatives cannot give consent, and we cannot allow their likeness or creative work to be emulated and copyrighted by thieves.<br/><br/>Do not allow copyright to extend to AI-produced content; it will destroy the lives of so many artists, writers, actors, voice actors, animators, and any other creatives whose work can be emulated by AI. Plagiarism is punishable when done by humans; punish plagiarism that&#39;s produced by machines as well by restricting its usage and the rights that can be applied to &quot;protect&quot; AI content, by denying copyright to anything that was not produced entirely with explicit, documented consent of all artists within the data set. Failure to deny consent is not the same. Require artists to explicitly consent and give personal permission before anything is considered consent; if it&#39;s hidden in the TOS of a website, it needs to now become an explicit checkbox that must be agreed to, stating that they are consenting explicitly to the use of their work for generative AI. <br/><br/>Otherwise, it&#39;s not real consent, and is enabling theft of the intellectual property of creatives.
