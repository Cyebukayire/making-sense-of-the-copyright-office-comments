Hi,<br/><br/>As a fiction author, my primary use of generative AI at this time is to generate marketing artwork with MidJourney, which I otherwise couldn&#39;t afford to commission. A good illustrator costs (and deserves!) a lot of money for their skill, while I receive less than $2 a copy for sales of my books. The cost is prohibitive.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve attached some of the AI-generated art for my current book launch. I generated several pictures of the book&#39;s protagonist, the train, and other characters. This art brings the book to life. (Blurred out the words, and a licensed image.) The book cover took two of my AI-generated images and artfully composed them.<br/><br/>My point: I&#39;d like all of these images to be copyright to me, Ginger Booth. The AI didn&#39;t suddenly dream up images for my story. It&#39;s a collaborative process.<br/><br/>Likewise, one of the most exciting generative AI applications, which is not quite there yet, is audiobook narration. Again, this is a very expensive skill to hire, $thousands per book, of which I see less than $2 per book royalties. But many readers prefer to listen. If I use an AI to narrate my book - and correct everything it did wrong - to provide a good listening experience, the AI output should be copyright me. Again, this is the output of a focused collaboration.<br/><br/>I&#39;d like to know that the AI&#39;s output does not have legal liabilities attached. I&#39;m certainly coming to the collaboration in good faith.<br/><br/>Thank you for accepting input.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/>Ginger Booth, science fiction author<br/><br/>
