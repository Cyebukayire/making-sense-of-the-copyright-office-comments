Do not take the human element out of art. A computer cannot create, only imitate, and should NEVER be regarded as an artist or anything more than a minimally used tool (think spell check or adding CG effects that cannot be done practically) in any form of art. Using copyrighted works to train AI is stealing and should forever be seen and legally treated as stealing. Trying to force writers out of work and make money on soulless imitations of their contributions to society is morally and socially bankrupt. Do not allow studios or corporations to profit from killing the arts.
