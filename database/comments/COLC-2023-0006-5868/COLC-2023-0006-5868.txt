The generative models being discussed here literally use what is known as a &#39;transformer architecture&#39;. The idea that this algorithm is not transformative by their nature is absurd on the face of it. Furthermore any tendency to recreate the training data is flagged by researchers as a failure case, the purpose of their construction is to be generative not reconstructive, and research is progressing rapidly towards further decreasing the already low rate of these failure cases. To quote the common aphorism, this is the worst that it will ever be in that regard.<br/>It is unreasonable that algorithms created for the purpose of studying these architectures and understanding the extents of what is possible with computation should not be allowed to use copyrighted material in their research.<br/>It is unreasonable that researchers should not be able to freely share their constructions alongside of their papers for review from both fellow institutional researchers and community researchers.<br/>It is unreasonable that people who have, through some legal means, acquired one of these algorithms would be bared from using these tools however they see fit. Prohibiting the use or sale of such a broad class of things that could be created with these tools would be akin to prohibiting the use or sale of 3d printed parts.<br/><br/>That all said however, &#39;researchers&#39; who work for corporations such as Midjourney or OpenAI whose sole purpose is to sell access to such tools, rather than to progress human understanding of these systems and provide that knowledge freely ought not to be protected by the defense of that scientific progress that really is happening in this space, as they are not actually participating in advancing the knowledge of humanity, but only their own personal knowlege.
