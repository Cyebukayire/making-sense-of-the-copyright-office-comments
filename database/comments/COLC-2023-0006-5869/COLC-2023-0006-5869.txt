I believe A.I shouldn&#39;t be used primarily for the art it uses but rather by used as a reference to build stronger ideas. Art is made out of human passion and skills just like the writers the make out the stories we watch/read or the musicians creating sounds to impact the story. They NEED someone with actual passion and drive to create the media we have today. A.I can only go so far with either generic art at best or monstrous/ uncanny at worst. So please consider using actual artists instead of just A.I
