An A.I. grows by feeding off of information/content from the internet. And yet on this same internet is copyrighted features. Thus far, A.I. has no modification to account for copyright laws and thus just feeds on what is someone else&#39;s legally owned work. This will surely cause a problem very soon- in fact it is now- and basically delegitimizes legal claim to work. A.I. companies must work to correct this ,otherwise what this country is saying is that theft is alright if it&#39;s in the name of short-term profits. Regulate A.I and prevent it from stealing artist&#39;s hard work!
