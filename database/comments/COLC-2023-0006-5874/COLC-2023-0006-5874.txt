As a college art major, I think it should be illegal for people to take any image they want and use them to train AI image models without express permission. Only images open to the public domain should be allowed for such open freedom and images made with these models should also be public domain.<br/><br/>I believe that if an AI image generator is going to use photography, art, or video footage that is under a copyright, they need to get proper permission and licensing in order to use them. Said permission should be written consent and royalty should be given with any AI generator that is use for commercial use (For example: it is an image generation website that requires a subscription to use). These generated images should also not be able to be copyrighted as they were not produced by a human.<br/><br/>It should be completely illegal for studios such as Disney, Netflix, Universal, etc to use AI to replace their animators, actors, and writers. This is taking jobs away from people to produce lower quality products. If AI is used for the production of a movie, TV show, or videogame, it should be legally required to state that part of it was machine generated.<br/><br/>I am the future of the creative world, and my future is being jeopardized by AI generated images and writing. It will be even harder for me to get a job as I am now being forced to compete with a machine that can take any art I create and add it to its AI. The world is becoming more and more hostile to artists, especially with the lack of regulation with AI. I want there to be strict and clearcut rules, because this is my reality. AI is heavily unethical as it is right now, and I&#39;m afraid.
