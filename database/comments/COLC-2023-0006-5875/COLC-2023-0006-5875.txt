AI is unregulated to the point of creating real and severely tangible issues. Copyright is suffering as a result, and artistic integrity is all but gone. <br/>We need all AI to be properly regulated to protect artists and consumers from harmful manipulation of AI generated content on all media. <br/>This is not limited to simply art or film, but literary works, and even photos of actual people are at risk unless you step in. We need regulation NOW! People&rsquo;s safety and livelihoods are at risk.
