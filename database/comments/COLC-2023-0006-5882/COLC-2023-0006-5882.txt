AI output should be copyrightable according to the normal rule of: if a human puts in significant creative effort, they can copyright the results.  While it&#39;s *possible* to use AI as one tool of many during a human-centric creative process, almost nobody using AI right now is actually doing that, and as a result the created works are so exceedingly similar to the source works (often deliberately so!) that in practice they defeat the entire point of copyright: allowing artists to make a living off art by providing an artificial monopoly on their own works.  After all, why pay an artist to make something for you when you can just have an AI imitate them for cheap?<br/><br/>Alternately, for a dip into intuition:<br/>If you take apples from your neighbor&#39;s yard, you don&#39;t own the apples.  If you put them through a blender and mash them into applesauce, you don&#39;t own that either.
