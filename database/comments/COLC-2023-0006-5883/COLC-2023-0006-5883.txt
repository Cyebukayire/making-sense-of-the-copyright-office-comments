AI MUST BE REGULATED! As a writer, I am constantly in fear of computer-generated &#39;writing&#39; earning the same accolades and stealing the livelihood of thousands like me. There are already stories of authors with false books attributed to them that were generated by AI for some sneak&#39;s profit margin. Artificial Intelligence is NO replacement for human ideas! Because it relies on stolen, pre-existing works to be generative, AI-created filth cannot and should not be copyrighted. AI infringes on the copyright of all the data it&#39;s mined to generate in the first place!
