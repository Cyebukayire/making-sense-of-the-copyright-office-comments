AI created content is trained off of illegally obtained artwork that does not credit or compensate the artists who created said artwork. While it may be argued that an artist&#39;s work existing on the internet gives the grounds for others to make transformative content, the use of AI to create the transformative content invalidates the labor that the artists have used. In addition, artists whose work is coopted by AI may be forced out of work as corrupt and greedy corporations choose to employ the AI to create art rather than the artist. This poses a unique and exploitative problem that has never faced artists before. As with all sectors of entertainment and creative industries, the reason people enjoy artistic creations is because of the human element behind it. They enjoy the story, the emotions, and the message conveyed. Using AI removes all of that from the equation. People of any education level are able to judge the quality of an entertainment product, and if they can tell it is easily made, a &quot;cash grab&quot; per se, they will dislike it and not return for more. That is the sort of product AI creates. To preserve the value of art, which is already at an all time low value when there are so few opportunities for artists to be paid for their work, AI work cannot be copyrightable. Yes, AI art will now always be an option for creators to use when creating artistic works. But making a product that was made from a congregate of illegally and unethically collected sources and trying to copyright it is hurtful to all artists and should never be allowed.
