Artificial intelligence used for the generation of images is a danger to the public at large that only benefits those wishing to deceive and exploit. It is a technology that offers nothing new to the public, only using the images that have already been created and shared on the internet then sampling them to create a similar final product. Mass layoffs in favor of saving money by using this technology threatens to damage the middle class by killing more skilled careers held by extremely dedicated craftsmen that seek to enrich the public&#39;s consciousness with novel, human ideas. This technology is also capable of creating politically volatile falsehoods with images difficult- to impossible- to discern as fake that are both created and shared at incredibly fast speeds. This technology also allows for more effective scamming, imitating a human through vast bot armies with no concept of empathy or ethics. <br/><br/>This is a technology that will not self regulate, as has been clearly demonstrated. It will be used to bleed the American people dry creatively and make finding truth even more painstaking than it already is, all the while funneling more money that would&#39;ve otherwise belonged to our lower and middle classes to tech barons.
