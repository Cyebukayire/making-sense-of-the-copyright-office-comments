Although AI has the potential to be a useful tool for artists of all type, the way it exists currently is very unethical and harmful for all of us both working in the creative field and consumers of said content. it draws data from preexistant content made by humans without their consent or permission and profits from it and companies see it as a replacement for human labor, using copyrighted works to save money and profit from human labor without compensating it.  <br/>Companies like Adobe for example, are implementing policies that forcibly upload your files to be fed to said datasets, regardless of it being NDA, trademark or not. This also paired to the fact that they offer their own AI generated assets with their paid stock library and tagging it with specific artist names, makes it clear that they want to take advantage of the labor of unconsenting creators without compensating it. <br/><br/>There are several things that should be regulated regarding AI if it has to exist, first of all, the datasets should be made with the permission of the creators whose works are being fed into the AI. And secondly AI generated content should be public domain/ not have copyright, as its not made by any human or made with any direct creative input wich could alter the final result
