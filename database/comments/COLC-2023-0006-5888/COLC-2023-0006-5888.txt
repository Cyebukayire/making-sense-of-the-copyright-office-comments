AI generated work of all kinds needs to be trained on legally-obtained data (public domain, open source, or with permission). Individuals should be able to opt out of their personal data (biometrics, advertising data, voice, likeness, etc) being scraped by AI, or better yet, be excluded by default. AI generated content needs a clear and distinct watermark designating it as such. AI generated content absolutely cannot be trademarked as this will allow bad faith actors to hoard copyrights en masse.
