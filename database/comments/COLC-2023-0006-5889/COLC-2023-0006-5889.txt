Since its inception with London&#39;s cabal of printers, copyright has been argued to be for the sake of the authors, when in actuality it only served to protect distributors. &quot;For the right of authors!&quot; cries the distributor, who themselves cuts under authors at every available turn while allowing no one to cut under themselves. Over time, the repetition has made a fictional sentiment ring true for many people, who do genuinely care about authors and believe in copyright as the way to protect them. <br/>I am not among these people, as you may guess. But many of you in the U.S. Copyright Office are. And I think we can agree that, given the current landscape of art and compensation, artists should be compensated through whatever means necessary. The AI differs from the artist in a couple of important respects.<br/>The main practical difference between an AI and a human artist is that the AI does not need compensation to live. It is a machine; inherently it has people to shelter, feed, and otherwise maintain it. The artist does not have these things, and yet the AI will steal from the artist.<br/>Of course, there is the person who created the AI. They need compensation to keep the AI going, especially because, as it turns out, AI is not a profitable business. I believe ChatGPT has been losing millions of dollars a day. The excitement that led to our current state was entirely speculative--imaginary. But because the business now exists, that business needs to steal in order to cheapen production. A business that steals in order to turn a profit (a profit that it can&#39;t even make WITH the stealing) is illegitimate, and the starving artist can&#39;t afford to keep paying for it. <br/>The job of the copyright proponent is to at least pretend to care about artists&#39; rights. If you are committed to this job, you will require licensing pay-outs for AI technicians to continue using artists&#39; work, just as someone in any other field is required to pay for a license. Moreso, you will continue looking past the machine&#39;s facade to the person creating it, to their motivations and their crimes, and blast this nonexistant industry to smithereens. Thanks.
