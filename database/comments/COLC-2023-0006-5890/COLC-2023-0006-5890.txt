AI works:<br/><br/>Counterfeit and plagiarism rules are sufficient for governing any AI works made &quot;in the style of&quot; a specific artist. AI-generated works deliberately prompted to mimic a particular artist&#39;s style, like &quot;Draw a cat in the style of Leonardo da Vinci,&quot; are not protected. However, works prompted more generally, like &quot;Draw a cat in a space suit,&quot; would be protected under the copyright of the prompt creator, not the AI software owner. Just as we do not grant rights to paint, chisel, and welding machine manufacturers for works made using their tools, AI is a tool and can be governed by these existing legal standards. With the exception of clear attempts to fabricate other artists&#39; works, which would be managed as counterfeiting or plagiarism. Parody and fair use would still be permitted in these cases.<br/><br/>The legislative framework for regulating AI content already exists under current law. There only need to be a few clear guidelines confirming that AI generators are tools, and their outputs are new works created by the prompter. If a prompter attempts to violate copyright, they are liable as with any artist - the tool manufacturer is not punished. You do not penalize someone making an homage to Starry Night, only someone passing it off as the original. AI is a tool, and how it is used determines how it is legally governed.<br/><br/>Training of AI:<br/><br/>For AI training, any public domain or freely licensed works may be used. Buried terms of service do not override copyright. Copyrighted works may be excluded from training if desired by the owner. As training is irreversible, legal protections should outline the permission and revocation period for including copyrighted content. Training on stolen data is illegal under existing property laws. Any AI trained on stolen data must be destroyed or auctioned, with proceeds going to those harmed as determined by the injured parties or class action suits.<br/><br/>AI rights:<br/><br/>AI systems currently have no inherent rights as independent entities, only the protections afforded to other patented technologies. A specific section of the law should be set aside to address the possibility of AI attaining sentience and rights. This AI rights section would clearly delineate between sentient and non-sentient AI, with a provision for evaluating and recognizing potential AI sentience in the future. The inclusion of this section will allow rapid amendment of AI laws to account for emerging intelligences, while clearly stating that current AIs have no rights and are property. The AI rights section would act as a placeholder, primed to govern all other AI legislation should verifiable AI sentience emerge. Until then, it remains an inactive but ready foundation for managing AI rights.
