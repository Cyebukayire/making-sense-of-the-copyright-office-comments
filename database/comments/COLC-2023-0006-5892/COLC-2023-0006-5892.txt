Hello. My name is Lana, AKA Jane. I believe I may be working in one of the creative fields most devastated by AI art. I&#39;m a professional clipartist. The bulk of my income comes from Etsy. Illustrating and selling clipart was my full time job up until this year, not too long after AI art started flooding the marketplace. You can search &quot;clipart&quot; in the search box on the platform and most of your results are now AI generated. Real human artists have been mostly eliminated from search and that has been devastating for me and many others. My income dropped 33% this year so far and I&#39;m considered lucky. <br/><br/>AI has devastated my niche in more ways than one. There is a popular subscription based model called Creativefabrica that got popular around last year. As we all know by now, subscription based models of almost anything creative are only successful by means of exploiting the creatives at the bottom. Creativefabrica is no different. On top of that, they have implemented their own AI clipart generator. I would find it hard to believe that has not also cut into my sales. Why would anyone pay an artist for clipart if they can get 1000&#39;s of AI generated images for for $20/m. <br/><br/>I am both unsurprised and astonished at the same time, to see such a powerful tool has been designed to reap the most possible rewards for a select few at the top, at the most possible expense of its unwilling contributors. I wake up every day questioning my worth, my existence, when I know I am living in a world where my life&#39;s work can be sucked up and twisted into a tool of the oppressor. All artists are currently living in a Black Mirror episode and it is terrifying. We are heading towards a deeply depressing future if this is what humanity has to offer the universe.<br/><br/>Attached below is a screenshot of my income for this year. My income is a solid -30+% across the board on other platforms as well. I also attached some of my favorite works to show what will be lost when artists have to stop creating because their work has been replaced by generic amalgamations. I would also suggest you visit etsy and search &quot;clipart&quot; The vast majority if your results will be AI generated. Anything hyper realistic is 99% likely to be AI generated when run through a AI detector. <br/><br/>www.Digitalartsi.com - My website
