Please do not allow copyright on generative images (AI). It only hurts those that are in creative fields, an already difficult business to get into. You will be taking away jobs from millions of people. Generative imaging does not learn and create like human minds do. It simply steals things that get fed to it and pastes things together. It has no valuable insight compared to human created works. Tools are being filled with copyrighted images without the consent of users constantly, and these thieves are profiting on it while the original copyright owners struggle. Allowing these things to continue unchecked will only hurt people in the long run. Please consider the hard work, time and effort artists of every genre puts into the work that we all enjoy every day and don&#39;t allow the continued abuse.
