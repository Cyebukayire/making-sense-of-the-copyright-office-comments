AI models should not be allowed to be trained on people&#39;s work without their consent. It shouldn&#39;t be fair use for machines that can mass produce work like yours to be able to do so and earn money. Artists and other creatives have been harmed by this as their markets and online presence is being leeched on my people who used to just repost their work. Now they are directly affecting their income too. Furthermore it&#39;s eroding the internet as we know it and even companies that claim to have made &quot;ethical gAI&quot; had to abuse their own stockholders to do so, harming their income as they did.<br/><br/>Adobe is one of such companies and they have not in any way compensated their stockholders, nor did they tell them this was happening. Furthermore they are selling derivatives of artists work on their stock using artists name and work. Which they have claimed they won&#39;t. They also sell generative images sharing the likenesss of real people. If you continue to allow this to happen creatives won&#39;t be show their work in public without risking having it stolen. If everything can be replicated in the millionth by people with 0 skills it will decentivise people who have worked hard to achieve such to create and the creative field will further lose its grounds for earning a living on their work.<br/><br/>Humans are not made to serve machines as a raw source of material that others can take and train them on.<br/><br/>Please visit www.CivitAI.com and see what&#39;s happening there.
