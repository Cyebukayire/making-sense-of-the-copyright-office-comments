I do not think companies should be allowed to train AI off of copyrighted material. I see it as something similar to cherry picking plagiarism. Additionally, these AI could later be used to replace the same people that created the content it learns from, which would be very unfair. AI content should not be copyrighted, as it is not original content created by a person, even when people are involved in the creation process. Content created by AI that infringes on copyrights should be taken down and removed, and whoever created it should receive a warning similar to what plagiarizers receive. <br/><br/>As fun as it is to hear Patrick from Spongebob to sing like Beyonce, using AI to mimick human voices can be very damaging. There have been several instances where AI has been used to make celebrities say things that they never have that were harmful to their reputation. In other instances, people have used celebrities&#39; voices to sing original songs and then made profit off of it, when the celebrity did not consent nor did they receive any compensation.<br/><br/>As a last note: I don&#39;t want to live in a world where I can&#39;t tell what is AI generated and what is true. I think in the long run, unrestrained AI will do more harm than good. I think it should be used to benefit all people, not just some at the cost of others.
