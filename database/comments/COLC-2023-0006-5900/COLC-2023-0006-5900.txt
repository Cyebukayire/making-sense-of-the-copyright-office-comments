AI needs to have some sort of copyright in place because people use it to take work from others who have clearly put in huge amounts of effort. AI takes from all artists alike, it&#39;s caused a handful of artists to go without work causing them to go without their hard earned money. Now I&#39;m not against AI when it&#39;s used for the right purposes like assisting someone with their work (ex. ChatGPT, Wordtune, etc.), making AI art for just personal use, or just having fun with AI by talking to fictional characters (ex. Character.AI), but when they solely rely on AI to create stuff from thin air and claim that as their work when it isn&#39;t is when it becomes an issue.
