To whom it may concern,<br/><br/>My name is Sarah Andersen and I am the Eisner-award nominated cartoonist behind three series including Sarah&#39;s Scribbles, FANGS, and Cryptid Club. I implore the Copyright Office to consider the myriad creators whose work went into creating A.I. text-to-image generators, all without consent, credit, or compensation. Our images were scraped from the internet without our knowledge and used to design an art generating system without any input from artists. This system was not created to assist us, it was designed to replace us.<br/><br/>A.I. text-to-image generators cannot work without the work of artists. Without us, the generators would have no basis on which to make art. Indeed, all art that text-to-image creates is a sophisticated collage of stolen artwork. Some outputs are so sophisticated that they already rival the artist from which they gleaned their source material, such as Greg Rutkowski. When you google his name, instead of seeing his own artwork, you see a mash up of his work and A.I. generated work meant to imitate him.<br/><br/>This is why I believe text-to-image generators can replace us. By scraping what often amounts to our entire portfolios, A.I. text-to-image generators use our own work to mimic our style. Why pay an illustrator or cartoonist for a commission or freelance work when you can pay a subscription fee to a generator and spit out images in an artists name?<br/><br/>Many artists believe that the scraping of our work for profit is a copyright violation, so much so that we have banded together to file suit in the case Andersen v Stability AI. It is our sincere hope to set precedent to protect our industry, and it is our hope that the Copyright Office will hear and acknowledge our concerns. We hope that you will listen to artists and provide protections, not just for us, but for everyone who&#39;s data was used without their consent to create for-profit generators.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my comments.
