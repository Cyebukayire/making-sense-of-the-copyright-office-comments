Hello, I am a systems engineer in California and I understand how &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; works. I will not get into the semantics of how incorrectly named this technology is, but it is a far cry from intelligent. Artificial intelligence as it stands today is little more than an  unrestricted plagiarism generator in need of regulation. It gathers data from across the internet, rearranges it, and spits out a &quot;you can copy my homework just change it up so it doesn&#39;t look like you copied&quot; version of everyone else&#39;s hard work. Reasonable regulations would protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense.
