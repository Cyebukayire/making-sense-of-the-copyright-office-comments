I believe that AI can be used responsibly by all. It is a tool, like any other and neither good or bad. How it is used determines its nature. It is a great time saver for one man studios and I would very much like to continue to use it for original artwork and music and not for replicating previous work by people. The best course of action is to implement a citing system similar to the MLA style for books. Have a place where credit is given to the generative AI. I would be willing to; others likely will.
