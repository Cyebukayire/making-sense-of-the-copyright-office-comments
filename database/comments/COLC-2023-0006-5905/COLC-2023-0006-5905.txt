I am very concerned about the use of AI to generate art. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s ethical to use the hard work of real people, especially without their permission, to train computers to create facsimiles of their artwork. I am especially worries about how many companies might try to use AI to replace artists, writers, actors, and other creatives to avoid paying hardworking and talented people what they deserve. Furthermore, I am opposed to attempts to copyright anything produced using AI since, to reiterate, it is usually trained by using the work of real people without their consent.
