Don&#39;t make a blanket law for all art.Jjust have a copyright law for AI to protect human artists. Any copyrights that would affect a human artist (such as style theft) could have the potential to kill them. If anything, limit what can be claimed as &quot;original&quot; by AI tools. and extend fair use for humans. i personally think the current copyright  laws are atrocious as they mostly only protect monopolies and horrendously rich people that wouldnt be hurt by art theft in the first place. I&#39;m sure more eloquent people have explained these points further.
