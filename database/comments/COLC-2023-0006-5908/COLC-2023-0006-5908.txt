AI is a threat to all creative minds, and to any and all human innovation. The current push to replace artists with robotic call-and-repeat algorithms is disturbing and should be understood as such going forward. While this comment might get lost in the flood, please know that artists are against AI. Writers are against AI. The way it strips and steals from existing art and existing artists should be a red flag in the first place. Most artists didnt consent to their works being stolen and uploaded into this information machine, and their likeness is being replicated and reproduced (and sometimes monetized) without the artist&#39;s say. Please regulate AI and set up protections for the artists immediately. We NEED to put protections in place going forward to regulate new technologies, especially starting NOW with the AI push.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time, and I hope you have a great day!
