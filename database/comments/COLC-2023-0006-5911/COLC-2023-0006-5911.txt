AI generative art, text, voice and the like is founded on mass theft of all creatives and of the general public. It robs us of our copyright, our likeness, art, voice and uses that to directly compete in the same market as creatives. This puts entire industries in danger and at risk of exploitation. There should be no copyright given to a program that is reliant on theft. Giving it copyright would encourage theft and exploitation and make it clear that we hold said act of theft to be more important and valued than any human creation. Companies who are promoting AI stand to make billions from cutting people off from their own labor and using them as fuel. For current entertainment industries, studios and individuals to survive AI needs to remain unable to be given copyright.
