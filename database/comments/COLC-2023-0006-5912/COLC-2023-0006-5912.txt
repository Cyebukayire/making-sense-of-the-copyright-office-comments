I&rsquo;m a small time artist. I love to do art for fun, but it&rsquo;s become extremely difficult to post my work on social media platforms as AI have scraped the internet without consent of artists like myself. AI has taken the artwork of others like myself to be used in prompts that&rsquo;s generated through what&rsquo;s typed by a user, while the AI model and the people who made said model have not once come into contact with any artist to keep their art out of the model. Even those who use AI show disdain nor don&rsquo;t understand how this technology is hurting artists in both trying to find a safe place on the internet to show their art, getting financial means taken and also jobs being stolen away with this technology. The same goes for writing and other jobs  that exist out there. Art is meant to be made by by human hands, having taken time and practice over the years. We all got to where we are by working hard daily and yet the AI models is stealing from on a daily basis without a care unless someone bigger artist sues them. I want to feel safe being able to post art on platforms again but as long as there&rsquo;s no ethical use with AI nor regulations, I can&rsquo;t ever feels safe. This was the same issue when NFTs were on the rise and even small artists were being stolen from to make profit. Even the art of deceased artists were used for such shallow schemes and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re used in the AI mess too as we speak. As long as the rights of artists, writers and more are being violated, none of us can feel safe nor survive on these platforms until AI gets under control and they remove our works from their models.<br/><br/>I just miss having fun showing friends and mutuals my progress. I want to post art again. I want to feel safe again and I feel restrained being unable to because of AI.
