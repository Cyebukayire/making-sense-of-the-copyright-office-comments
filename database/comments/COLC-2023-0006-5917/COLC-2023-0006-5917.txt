Please provide regulations on AI and force current companies using it to purge their datasets or pay the artists/writers/entertainers that they have stolen from. Copying an artist&#39;s style/voice/likeness to create something they haven&#39;t consented to is horrifying and should have legal consequences. AI created content can damage a person&#39;s imagine if done maliciously but it also allows studios to take advantage of current creators who are having trouble making a living as is. I hope you&#39;ll stand behind creators during this trying time and help regulate the abusive uses of AI.
