Generative AI content/products must never be allowed to be copyrighted. AI content generators are solely dependent on content created by humans. Because AI content is cheap and easy to produce and because it relies on the content of the real humans it seeks to compete with, I contend that it&rsquo;s sole purpose is to destroy competition in the marketplace by giving individuals and corporations who control these AI algorithms an unfair advantage. Furthermore, the datasets used to train these algorithms were acquired without permission, compensation or consent of the original owners of the data. These data sets must be destroyed. <br/><br/>It is well known that the output of AI content generator&rsquo;s quickly begins to deteriorate in quality as soon as they start to use data generated by their own output. This proves that if left unchecked, AI will become the proverbial snake eating its own tail. <br/><br/>Human creatives feed off of the creativity of each other. We gain inspiration from the works of other humans and add our own unique and inspired experiences to our creations based sometimes on the works of others. This is what true progress looks like. AI generated content is incapable of building upon itself in the same way. It represents a breakdown (not a breakthrough) of 5,000 years of human expression and creativity. <br/><br/>AI can create amazing things, but only because it uses the human generated data created by amazing human creatives. If the creativity of real humans is disincentivized by theft based data scraping algorithms, we will one day very soon live in a world without real art where creativity and innovation are dead.<br/><br/>In a world where no one has any incentive to be creative, why would we need a copyright office?
