I believe AI-generated work (be it writing/art/sound/etc) should NOT be allowed to be copyrighted. As an artist and having witnessed several artists have their work used in AI without permission, I have seen how much it hurts the livelihoods of creators. It can completely take away someone&#39;s entire income, and if generated content that basically mimics a person&#39;s entire creative output (for example, VO), can be copyrighted, there would be virtually no way for that person to be able to fight back. If an artist pioneers a new style or technique, and AI copies much of it AND copyrights it, who would win in a lawsuit about copyright infringement? Everyone has a right to want their work, image, voice, and etc to be protected, and being able to copyright a cheaply made &quot;copy&quot; of said content completely disregards that right.<br/>
