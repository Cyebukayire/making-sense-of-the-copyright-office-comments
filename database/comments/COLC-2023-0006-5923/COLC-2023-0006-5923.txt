AI, in theory is an amazing tool that will change how the world works. But first we must make sure that some common sense rules are applied. Namely protections for individuals whom create and are dependent on those creations for their living. Allowing companies to illegally benefit and profit from the works of others that receive no such compensation is a very dangerous and immoral business model that only benefits a very small group all while killing multiple industries and stealing property. We must not allow companies to &ldquo;scrape&rdquo; what ever they want without the 10s of thousands of hours of work by those individuals with compensation or recognition. Please put people over profits on this one.
