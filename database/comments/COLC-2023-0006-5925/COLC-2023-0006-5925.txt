I am not representing my organization, but I am a professional writer in the digital/technology space. AI-generated content should absolutely NOT be eligible for copyright for many reasons. First, any content submitted into or generated by AI remains in the system to be reused or built upon later, thus guaranteeing an infringement of copyright at a later date, regardless of the intention of the user, who would suffer. Second, nearly every AI algorithm is trained on datasets scraped from often-copyrighted content without the permission of the creator or site owner, meaning the system itself already abuses copyright as it is. Third, AI content simply recreates patterns that already exist. this would give large corporations an unfair advantage to pursue copyright claims against individual creators, and make it difficult for individual writers to protect their own work. Fourth, it would damage the ability of writers like myself to maintain their careers and make a living using their skills. Fifth, AI content is generated based on patterns, often devoid of logic, full of convincing misinformation. Thus, to publish anything from AI responsibly, a writer has to rigorously fact check it, and often rewrite it to meet minimum quality standards, meaning most content that gets published in an honest and well-intentioned way is rewritten by a human anyway. Sixth, if AI-generated content is able to be copyrighted, it is likely that the corporations creating and providing these services would maintain a claim on this copyrighted work, further damaging the ability of writers to make a living. In short, allowing AI-generated content to be copyrighted would be wildly irresponsible and recklessly inconsiderate to a diverse and talented industry of writers, editors and artists.
