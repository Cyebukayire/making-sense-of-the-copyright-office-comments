Generative algorithms - colloquially known as &quot;ai&quot; - cannot function without being fed a tremendous amount of data from which to generate their outputs. This data is often scraped from thousands of copyrighted pieces which is then recombined by the algorithm to create a facsimile of that media. This process does not involve human input in the generation of the actual piece, only in feeding the algorithm information and then prompting the algorithm. While the technology is impressive what it creates is not human made and is the result of a form of informational theft at such scale as to be comical. Generative algorithms do not create, they can only re-arrange information fed to them. Information that is almost always stolen intellectual property of other individuals and organizations. Allowing this form of media to be copyrightable flies in the face of what copyright has always sought to do, and would grant any individual or organization the ability to steal and appropriate any work they could feed to the algorithm by obfuscating their theft through shear scale. Generative algorithmic media should never be allowed the protection copyright provides them.
