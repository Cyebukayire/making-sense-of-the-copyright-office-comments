The computer is not simply an instrument used to create this art. AI is pulling from sources, such as visual art, made by human beings, and using it as a base to create new images. AI enthusiasts will argue that it&#39;s similar to the process of artists using inspiration by taking visual cues from already existing artwork to make something new. However, that could not be further from the truth. AI does not have the discerning eye that a human has when trying to avoid issues of plagiarism. It&#39;s goal is to create a specific image based on a prompt, and if a specific artistic style is specified, it will emulate that at any cost. It does not care if it&#39;s copying the pose, color palette, facial features, combination of figure and background etc, of a past work. It&#39;s goal is to COPY, not INNOVATE. And because of that, in good conscience I do not believe you should give AI creators the ability to copyright their creations. Everything that they make is already based upon the work of others. They do not deserve the ability to do so, because they have not earned it. And they do not have the ability of knowing that what they have created hasn&#39;t been done before, because they are not the ones who composed the image, sound, etc.
