Unlike human creators, the programmers responsible for creating and managing machine learning language software (as calling it truly artificially intelligent would be a lie) can reasonably control what sources are used to teach the program. Given this fact, these programs should be made to disclose their data sources, and severely restricted, not just fined, if their learning material contains any stolen works. Machine learning companies should not be allowed or permitted to gain income from copyrighted works they do not own, and should be punished for attempting to do so and dissolved entirely should they refuse to acquiesce. Piracy is a federal offense, and given the potential for the language model to regurgitate any intake as written without citation, it is an integral part of these companies. This makes regulating their operations an essential task to preserve copyright and trademark laws.
