AI as it stands is nothing more than algorithmic mass plagiarism. The way these programs function and are used produces nothing truly new or individual. It merely deconstruts millions of works made by real people and uses those pieces to approximate new content without ever getting permission from the artists who are having their hard work and intellectual property used in this process. There should be no legal protection for tools like this. At its most benign it is the same as collage made from other paintings or a song made entirely of samples from other artists. You wouldn&#39;t allow a movie to go to the box office if it was made entirely from clips of other movies edited together without permission from any of the filmmakers or production companies who made the orginal movies. These AIs do the same thing just on an even larger scale.
