The art world is already difficult as it is, we put our heart and souls into our creations with ever brush stroke, every chisel, every expression.  Not only is AI nowhere near the level for it to be appealing, it basically steals the artwork from others and just regurgitates them into a distorted mess.  The proportions of anatomy are off, and the idea that companies would choose AI instead of hard working artists is just sickening and a showcase of never ending greed.
