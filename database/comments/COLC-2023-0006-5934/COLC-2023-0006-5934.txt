I really think AI should not be copyrightable, its not fair for people around the world who worked hard to be where they are now. Im a unknow artist with a few fanbase but i never struggled monetary or finding work, since AI started I have lost a lot of job opportunities and people who were regular costumers started using AI generative images. Please, do not let this people who do not care about the life of others change to worse
