It is a common strategy to refer to the AI vs artists issue in the same manner as factories vs manual labor. However, it is not factually correct as the AI cannot exist without its databases &mdash; so, without unpaid labor of millions of artists. On average, an artist also doesn&rsquo;t have the means to have the same legal protection as IT companies, simply because good lawyers cost money and copyright litigations may take a while, so the expectation is that the artists will not be able to protect themselves from blatant exploitation of their work. It is extremely easy to say that &ldquo;it works differently and it&rsquo;s not technically theft&rdquo;, but as long as someone&rsquo;s profit directly relies on other people&rsquo;s free work (and without any consent whatsoever at that), there is no doubt that it violates the right to be compensated for one&rsquo;s labor. <br/><br/>It is also worth noting that the process of using databases is extremely different from using references. First, references do not copy the original image (and when they do, it is a very valid ground for a lawsuit). Second, it is much more common to make one&rsquo;s own references (eg take pictures) except for studies (and studies are not normally paid work). Third, using references provides knowledge about light, shapes, color and shadow &mdash; and not the visual materials to copy. As common as it is to claim otherwise, genAI does not have such knowledge and understanding and instead averages out provided source material. <br/><br/>In addition to that, the Adobe Photoshop experiment with integrating AI into its system proves that it gives enormous possibilities to emulate specific artists style and skills. It is clear that the intention is not a scientific breakthrough but simply a convenient way to overtake art as an industry without investing into artists and their skill. It is, undoubtedly, the largest coup in history, and I sincerely hope that it will soon be treated as such.
