I find that &quot;AI generated content&quot; is, by its nature, plagiarism. It does not create anything new, but instead scrapes content from across the internet to be recreated without human effort. It displays a disgusting moral vision of a world wherein creative works are reduced to components utilized by lazy hacks and parasites who want to profit off the hard work of people who have honed their craft for years to gain the skills they have.<br/><br/>Already, there have been cases of &quot;AI&quot; generated text being used to impersonate authors and spread misinformation, and &quot;AI&quot; artwork being used for profit when it directly plagiarizes actual human artists. <br/><br/>In addition to my moral outrage on this subject, I also find AI art generally disgusting to look at and very unpleasant to the eye. Its strange &quot;perfection&quot; coupled with partially melted features makes it disturbing. <br/><br/>Plus, it really should have a different term than &quot;AI&quot; associated with it, given that there is no actual intelligence involved, just generative programs.
