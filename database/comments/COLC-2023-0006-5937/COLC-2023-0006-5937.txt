AI creations made via &quot;prompts&quot; should not be allowed to be copyrighted. &quot;Prompts&quot; are not a sufficient way to judge human involvement in the creation of art. A &quot;prompt&quot; gives the computer direction, but it draws on already established concepts and already created images to generate an image. Therefore, the image created is not new, but generated based on past human creations. The human manning this AI has no way of telling if parts of it aren&#39;t plagiarized because they did not source the visual inspiration themselves, the AI did, from vast banks of imagery fed to it by millions of people. They did not personally create any part of the composition, so how can they know if they are truly not breaking any laws? When the computer assembles this image, you lose a core principle of art: human intention. Without this, you cannot be sure that you are not plagiarizing anything.
