I strongly believe generative AI destroys art itself. It promotes laziness and over-reliance on technology instead of honing skills and creating something on your own. It makes people settle for less, as in, they blindly accept what the machine gives them as absolute and good when in reality, they could create something far better if they tried within the same time frame. Not only that, but it also destroys diversity, as many will only use it to create works in the most sought after, most popular art styles, instead of creating their own. More so than it would if people copied from each other, because these machines produce massive amounts of spam artwork and overflood websites with this. It should not be copyrightable because it requires the usage of other artwork to even produce anything. Without it, it cannot do anything. Please, don&#39;t just look at it as a quick way to make profit. Look at it on a broader perspective. Projects that take longer often times result in audiences being more pleased, therefore willing to spend a lot more money on it. That goes for music, movies, and yes, even artworks themselves. It really isn&#39;t as progressive a tool as the supporters claim. These are algorithms that have existed for years, and are only now being used to &quot;make&quot; art. In reality, it&#39;s not even made as the AI combines multiples of other artist works and outputs something that is a combination of them based on the input. Nobody benefits from this aside from the ones creating it to exploit artists and destroy creative spaces. So I strongly feel like it should be its own division, and not considered on the same level as human creations. Certainly not copyrightable, just a tool to be used for non-commercial purposes.
