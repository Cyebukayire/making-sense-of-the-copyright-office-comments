As an artist I am completely against AI. It&#39;s only hurting new, young and old artists. AI should not continue to be developed for it will only destroy a community that above passion, thrive to survive. To many art is their main income. It&#39;s beyond unfair to have out art treated by a system that that won&#39;t even recognize is ours and give us credit at all.
