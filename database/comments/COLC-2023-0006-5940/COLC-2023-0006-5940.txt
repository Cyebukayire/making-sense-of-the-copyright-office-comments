<br/>AI is an existencial threat to copyright, and needs to be tightly controlled. Inclusion in a data set must be opt-in, with the option to later be removed. <br/><br/>Punishments for violation of this opt-in law must be sufficient to destroy utterly any company responsible for frequently adding, or allowing by some other party to be added, media that does not have opt-in metadata.<br/><br/>Some sort of licencing system would also likely be nessasary. As this affects foreign companies, the law must be set up to prevent evasion of the law by, for example, hosting servers in another country. The law must apply to all services that allow US customers, and all media protected by US copyright law.<br/><br/>Images produced by an AI that is found to be sufficiently offending to be shut down must be rendered unusable, perhaps by transferring the rights to a government-owned body, and then by having rights holders affected allowed to request transfer of the rights to them.<br/><br/>Finally, a free option must exist for copyright holders to submit official complaints, and these complaints must be acted on in a timely manner.
