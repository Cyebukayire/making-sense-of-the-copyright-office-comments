As someone who did a lot of digital art in my time as a young artist, and spent years practicing and perfecting these skills, I have to make a few things very clear. Tracing over a piece of art is not considered original work, it&#39;s considered artistic plagiarism, if it is done by human hands. I don&#39;t see why it would be considered anything else when an algorithmic machine does it. I cannot comprehend a world where someone can use an application to get away with what amounts to art theft. We don&#39;t allow it with AI generated texts in college, why would we allow it with AI generated &#39;art&#39;? A person can plug in the name and style of a particular artist and the AI will essentially amalgamate their works together to create an equivalent of it through algorithmic analysis, very often includes using copyrighted material without permission of the artist to generate. This is ESPECIALLY bad if the AI art ends up being sold to a third party. An AI isn&#39;t a person, it can&#39;t make the decision to sell its work, or make the decision to plagiarize, but it *is* used as a tool by bad actors with no respect for the legal or ethical boundaries. If (and I hope there should be) legislation on AI art in the near future, I should hope that there will be provisions/protections for artists to pursue legal action should their IP be stolen and reworked without consent.
