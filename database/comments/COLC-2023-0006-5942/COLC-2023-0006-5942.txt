Hello U.S. Copyright office, thank you for reaching out to all of us on this!<br/>As an artist, I have major concerns with the current state of artificial intelligence and art. Currently, both copyrighted works of art and works of art in the public domain have been taken without permission, notification, or compensation, numbering in the thousands if not millions, in order to &#39;train&#39; a predictive algorithm to estimate what the next pixel will be based on associated prompts. It cannot be said that there is any creativity or originality in the resulting product, as that product is strictly limited to its training data. There is little to no transparency as to what works are used to train the algorithm, which means that prompters cannot check for racial bias, cannot determine if any nudity is artistic or pornographic, or that an image of a person was used with that person&#39;s permission. The end result of this process is then given to the prompter, without references, without attribution, and quite possibly almost directly copied from a single piece of copyrighted art, or from a curated selection of an artists work, directly infringing on said artists copyright. Furthermore, I have heard horror stories that private medical records were accidentally included in the training dataset, and the training process based on these private medical records either has not or cannot be undone.<br/>In short, the current state of AI art is a mess.<br/>I would like if the Copyright Office should find that any artificial intelligence for art must use a training database that is either in the public domain or has works that individual artists have consented to be used in a training dataset. Furthermore, the final product should come with a list of references of which works were used in the creation of said product, just as any college student writing a paper is expected to list what sources influenced their paper.
