In terms of protecting the livelihood of artists, AI models that generate images from large groups of works made by the hard work, practice and personal experiences of human beings are both theft and regression, making future works less inspired and without intent and robbing people who wish to bring forth art to this from their possibility to do so.<br/><br/>In terms of general logic, since the generated works are amalgamations of copyrighted material whose source is hidden both by design and necessity they have no true creator and hence would both be loopholes to make copyrighted material available as public domain and would and impossible to assign to a single individual<br/><br/>
