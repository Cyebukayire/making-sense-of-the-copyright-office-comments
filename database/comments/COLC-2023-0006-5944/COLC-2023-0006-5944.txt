Plagiarism is the fraudulent representation of another person&#39;s language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions as one&#39;s own original work. An AI absorbs information without discrimination, therefore it is incapable of avoiding copyright-protected material or intellectual property. It also cannot properly cite every piece of data it has filtered through. Thus, AI is a form of mass-plagiarism. While an AI may be programmed with failsafes to avoid certain websites, the sheer variety of methods in which information and media are made available online makes it so that this plagiarism is inevitable. To protect copyrighted material and intellectual property from this new form of plagiarism, the owners of AI systems must be held accountable, and a solution must be designed in which a company or creator may consistently mark their data as unavailable for AI use. AI developers must be then be held to the standard that they will program their AI to recognize this mark and not violate copyright or intellectual property law.
