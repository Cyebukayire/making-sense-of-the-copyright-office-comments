Most generative AI is built on a body of stolen work and stolen intellectual property, much of which is already copywritten, and all work born of that AI is an illegal amalgamation of that work. There is little to no work done by the person using the AI and therefore it does not meet the criteria required to be copywritten.<br/><br/>Only an AI that is built from the work of the person or people using that AI, such as the program created by the artists by and for the &#39;Spiderverse&#39; movies, which was used exclusively as reference and not as final version, creates a product that meets the criteria to be copywritten.<br/><br/>Anything created from generative AI that uses non consenting works, no matter the format, should not be able to be copywritten or profited from. It is stolen work.
