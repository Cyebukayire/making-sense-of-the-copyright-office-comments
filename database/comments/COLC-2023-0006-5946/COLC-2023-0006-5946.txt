For the public comment period about AI, I would to recommend that artists and authors are given the ability to be able to copyright their works from AI use.<br/><br/>As from what I&rsquo;ve seen, many artists and writers have unique styles to their works. A large majority of the time, they are recognizable when replicated by AI. So I find it sensible that the creators of these sorts of art should have the option to copyright their style. Not from other humans, of course, but just AI.
