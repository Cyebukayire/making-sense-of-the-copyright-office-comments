I am concerned about the current abilities and therefore future abilities of AI being used to scrape data (including copyrighted works, personal likenesses, or other legally protected aspects of a person or piece of work) and use that data to generate new works, at alarming speeds.<br/>AI does not have sentience, an ability to understand consent, an ability to agree to follow laws or legalities by itself. Only people can do so (and in the case of one animal who took a selfie in a famous legs case). But even if people on the programming end of AI input legal frameworks, there is no guarantee it will follow these frameworks to the letter of the law. Law is both black and white and indeed gray. Its application, meaning, and indeed the very statutes are ever changing. And even the most studied jurist can make errors in judgment, application, or in following the law.<br/>Works therefore created by AI, even with intense legal frameworks built into it, cannot be considered creative nor expected to be fully comply with the law in &lsquo;learning&rsquo; from their dataset. It would be the equivalent of trying to copyright a Roomba&rsquo;s pattern on a floor, or the output from a calculator, or the results of spreadsheet tabulations. These very things may have copyright in their creation by humans, but their output, even in following strict legal frameworks, fails to be an action of creation but merely a mathematical output.<br/>In full combination and summation, AI works are outputs of a program or complex mathematical design, often using illegally obtained base learning material, and even when not are not creations in such, and therefor should not be able to be copyrighted.
