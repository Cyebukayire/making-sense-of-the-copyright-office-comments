AI is not a tool. It&#39;s copyright infringement. It&#39;s stealing the work of others without their knowledge with the ultimate goal of making the human behind the results, be it art or writing, completely irrelevant. People who&#39;ve trained for years, put money into their education, will have no income. Art will have zero value, because you can get it at the click of a button. And legal, medical, any sort of advice, will soon be the same. People will be on the streets, made homeless due to companies literally stealing their own work. Art won&#39;t evolve, it will only be continuous re-hashing of what has already been done. AI is so blatantly and obviously destructive, it&#39;s depressing. So many young people will have no reason to dream, train, or put any effort into anything, as they know they will only be replaced. Humans in every field are irrelevant when machines are already praised as doing it &#39;better.&#39; And all for the economic benefit of a few, not for all of humanity. We already produce and consume more than we need to, so what is the real benefit of doing it even faster and cheaper? The only answer is = more money for SOME people, and much, much less for everyone else.
