As a writer and actor, I vehemently oppose AI-generated content being made copyrightable. The content that AI generates depends on copyrighted content created by human writers. Without that source material, AI cannot generate anything. Unless and until we have a system in place to compensate writers every time their work is sourced by AI in the creation of generated content, then there is no ethical justification for allowing that content to be copyrightable, and I believe we are already past the point of that being done. Language model AI technology and the unethical application of it is currently threatening the present and future viability of my line of work. We cannot allow computers to steal the works of countless artists and creatives in order to make us obsolete, ensuring a dystopian future in which all content is literally derivative and devoid of humanity. Thank you for conducting this study and I hope very much that you will prioritize humanity over the corporate greed that lurks behind the desire to copyright AI-generated content.
