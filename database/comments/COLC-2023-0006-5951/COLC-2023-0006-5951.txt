I am Manuel Rodriguez, and I wish to argue the point that AI generated Media should be banned. While yes, others may claim for it to be a good thing, the truth of stuff with AI can be dangerous to artists, voice actors, writers, etc. If AI was to be copyrighted, then many within the media field would be in danger, as AI art doesn&rsquo;t create, it only steals; voices of actors and people can say whatever they want without the voice&rsquo;s consent; and overall the amount of creativity from all people will be lost, as jobs that fill in the role of creative people will be lost, and forced to train something that will never have a true thought in mind, only to be used as a cash grab for the greedy corporates who don&rsquo;t care about the true meaning of art. So much problems will be created if you don&rsquo;t do anything about the situation, let alone approve copyrighting the rights to allow people to make possibly harmful content to others around the world. As an artist, and to the many writers, artist, voice actors, and more around the media industry, please protect us all who will be harmed by the creation of AI work. Thank you, and please restrict the use of AI or ban it.
