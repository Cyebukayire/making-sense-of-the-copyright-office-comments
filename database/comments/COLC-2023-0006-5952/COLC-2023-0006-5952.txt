I personally view generative AI technologies, in their current form, as blatantly infringing on the copyrights of artists. Very frequently these models are trained on data taken from stolen images, especially from individual artists, without their knowledge or consent. Given that generative AI models expressly rely on this stolen data, and cannot generate or original media themselves, I do not believe this falls under any category of fair use. The standards of practice for using AI models of any kind must be regulated strictly in order to protect the intellectual properties and copyrights of artists and individuals.
