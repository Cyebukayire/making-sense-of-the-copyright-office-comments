I think ai generated or ai collaborated creation should only be able to apply for copyright if: more than 50% of the &quot;work&quot; was done by a human claiming the right or the work was generated entirely from that humans own body of work (eg if Tom Clancy wanted to train an ai purely on his novels and then edit the result into a work, okay).<br/><br/>Otherwise, I&#39;m deeply concerned about how these technologies will be used to continue flooding creative markets with properties that reduce human opportunities for creation. <br/><br/>What value does an ai generated book cover give us? Not nearly as much as having a human artist creating a unique work. That provides employment, collaboration, and creation.<br/><br/>It does cut costs for companies, but is that what copyright is meant to do? I think copyright is meant to encourage creation and innovation by protecting the creators and the profits generated from their invention. <br/><br/>AI doesn&#39;t do innovation, it just regurgitates old inventions.
