Please regulate generative ai! Websites like Stable Diffusion is scraping content that is copyrighted or private. This is affecting livelihoods. Not only is it taking from all corners of the web, it is able to replicate styles of existing and working artists. This can affect their jobs and income. People who do not have the skillset to produce an actual piece without typing a prompt or stealing artwork and inputting it into AI to regenerate are making a living off the expense of working artists that the AI scraped. Please protect artists who have honed their craft for years. Do not let AI be copyright-able, and please find a way to regulate AI hosts like Stable Diffusion to credit and work FOR artists that it has scraped the work of. Or remove its technology altogether. At its current form, it does not help the artists it steals from.
