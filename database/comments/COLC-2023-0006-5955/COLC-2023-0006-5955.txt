Dear Regulators,<br/><br/>I am writing in regards to using trademarked material in a generative AI model. I believe there is an important distinction to be made in regards to whether the trademarked material was used as training data or as an end-user entered command. I feel that the latter of the two is considered more of a copyright infringement. I&#39;ve thought of 3 examples to illustrate my point:<br/><br/>1. An end user might enter &quot;Create an episode of Family Guy featuring product xyz&quot; into an already-trained AI LLM model. The result of this should be classified as copyright infringement of Family Guy. <br/>2. An AI LLM being trained by watching every episode of every show in Family Guy&#39;s genre and then &quot;creating a cartoon with product xyz.&quot; This would not be copyright infringement because it simply learned from watching all episodes in a genre. The command was also &quot;create a cartoon&quot; which did not mention anything copyrighted.<br/>3. An AI LLM being trained by watching every episode of Family Guy and then creating a cartoon with &#39;product xyz.&#39; This would lean into copyright infringement because the model was trained only on Family Guy. This also illustrates a grey area where an AI model can be trained to infringe.<br/><br/>A final point that I believe should always be considered is how restricting training data will affect us as a nation on a global stage. It&#39;s reasonable to assume that generative AI is being studied extensively by all nations and restricting how we use training data will adversely affect American primacy in what may be the most profound industrial revolution of our time. We do not want America&#39;s enemies advancing their AI faster than us.<br/><br/>Thank you and God bless America.
