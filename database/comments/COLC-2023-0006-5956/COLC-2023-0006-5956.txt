Ai are fundamentally spits in the face of any art, be it drawn or written. Not in a philosophical sense, but literally as it is all either spliced together bits of other work, or trained to mimic or replicate it. It isn&rsquo;t feasible to allow it to be wide spread as most of it pulls from copyrighted work anyway, rendering it plagiarism and illegal.
