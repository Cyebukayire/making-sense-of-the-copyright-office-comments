I apologize for lacking eloquence or substantial evidence, but I believe AI generated art cannot be considered equal to art as it is machine-generated, meaning it cannot be copyrighted. I believe there must be an amount of additional work on the part of creators that follows similar rules to the Fair Use doctrine before AI generated work can be considered copyrightable. Artificial intelligence is meant to be a tool to assist creators, not equal to them.
