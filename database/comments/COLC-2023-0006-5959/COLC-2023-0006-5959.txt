I am not an American citizen, I am an artist from Latin America and like other artists around the world, I am being harmed by AI. I can&#39;t do much for my class because I&#39;m not even in the United States, the country where genAI companies are located. the whole world today is relying on the common sense of American lawmakers and officials to protect us from this threat. yes, threat. genAI threatens our survival and the future of humanity. art and creativity are fundamental for all human beings. Is it possible to imagine a world without it? where a machine will replace and level creativity and art to the bottom? This cannot be our future and it is in your hands to save us. Please help us now.
