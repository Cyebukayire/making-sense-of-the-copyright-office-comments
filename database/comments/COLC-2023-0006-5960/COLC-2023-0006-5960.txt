YES to A.I. for a Database that you own or have a license for (just like Photobashers or Editors need to own the content they are editing).<br/><br/>NO to A.I. that uses an UNCONSENTING Database (like Midjourney and a lot Stable Diffusion Models). <br/><br/>Its not fair that you can feed all of MY pictures - that I completely drew myself - into and AI and immitate my art or fuse it with other artists and call it YOURS. <br/><br/>An artists learns it skills through fundaments, experience, learning the essence of other artists and immagination, and AI &#39;learns&#39; through copying and scrapping together, completely dependet from the source images.<br/><br/>Dont give AI Prompters the copyright to our creations. <br/>
