Generative AI has been developed from the theft of images, artwork, and other information from the public, without our consent or compensation. And the people and companies that developed these programs have stolen from the public knowingly, without any care for our approval. Those companies also profit financially, and don&#39;t pay the people that they have stolen from. Nothing developed with generative AI should ever be able to be protected under copyright, and these programs should all be investigated for their business practices.<br/><br/>If generative AI will continue to be used, people will continue to be stolen from, while these huge tech companies will continue to seek profit. People in creative industries will continue to suffer and more jobs will be lost as a result. Once those creative jobs are lost, they will never return and creative jobs will be lost forever. There needs to be more protection against the use of generative AI, and there must be more oversight in it&#39;s development.
