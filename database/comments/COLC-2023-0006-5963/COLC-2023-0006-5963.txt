AI created works should not, and in my opinion cannot, fall under copyright law. It is not a human made work. A majority of the &ldquo;work&rdquo; is done by a computer. AI art is like ordering food from a restaurant. One tells the waiter/waitress (ai), what they want, and they are given a final product to consume. Except even in the case of the restaurant analogy, there are things that make it even more complex than the issue of AI. For example, money being involved as an exchange for the service, and a human having to prepare the food. AI generated content is not only often times free to produce, but, as stated before, has no human skill put into the work. It cannot be then claimed as a copyrighted work, considering the most a person did in this process was give some sort of prompt. <br/><br/>Copyright covers the creative products of artists and companies so that their works cannot be illegally distributed or recreated. AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; is trained and built entirely off of the stolen works of millions of artists, and allowing such stolen works to be used to create intellectual properties is hypocritical at best, and illegal at worst.
