As an artist with experience in computer science, music, music education, and study of music history: I believe it is in the best interest to the artistic community, computing, and the U.S. Copyright Office to regulate AI creation and to prevent AI creation from being given the same legal protections as works authored by humans. While the technology has valid uses, the ramifications of granting copyright protections to works created by processes which involve direct theft of art (see: Midjourney scraping art from the internet to train their models) to be harmful for the economic wellbeing of artists.
