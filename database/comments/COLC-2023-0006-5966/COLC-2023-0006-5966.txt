Artificial Intelligence, more specifically generative A.I., has breached copyright for many small to medium sized businesses who need clients for survival. To allow artifical intelligence to have the same benefits as works it steals information and data from feels like a slap in the face. I would be more in favor of regulating generative A.I. programs like Midjourney or DALLE from using copyrighted images and works. You could very well wreck the foundation of art as a whole and make it tougher for artists lowest on the totem pole to find work. And to that, I would vote no.
