As an artist and friend of artists, AI art presents a serious threat to our work and livelihoods, all while utilizing our work without our notification or consent to do so. We now live in a world where AI can be trained on an unconsenting individual&#39;s work, specifically to replicate and compete with that individual&#39;s unique style. The threat this presents is dire, and if copyright is to work for America&#39;s artists and creatives, the copyright office must step in and put a stop to this.
