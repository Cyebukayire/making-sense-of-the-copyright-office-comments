Thank you for opening this topic to the public to comment on. I make art for fun and support artists, writers, and photographers in their ventures. I think that the use of copyrighted material to train AI is criminal on its own. If someone stole someone else&#39;s copyrighted material, there could be legal action taken against the person who stole it. People are stealing copyrighted material, art that is not theirs, writing that is not theirs, to train a machine learning algorithm to make more works of junk that legally doesn&#39;t count as art because a human didn&#39;t work and make it. Unless the stolen piece of work is in the public domain, it shouldn&#39;t be used to train AI. The Copyright Office should be able to see that this training method is a violation of the Copyright Act when done without the original creator&#39;s permission. <br/>Thank you again for opening this commenting period to see the public&#39;s opinion on this important matter.
