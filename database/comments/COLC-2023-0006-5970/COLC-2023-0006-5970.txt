Ai is built on copyrighted works. It has no original thoughts it can only copy. If i ask someone who has never seen a car, to draw one, then they will come up with their own idea based on my description. An AI won&#39;t do that, it will take the words of my description and try to find what chain of pre existing material it can chain together to get as close to what I&#39;m asking. No original thoughts, no input. It&#39;s not a original work. Show me an AI that can produce images without training. Then it will deserve copyright
