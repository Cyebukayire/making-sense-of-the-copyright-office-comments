AI is a major threat to my livelihood and the lives of others working in the creative market. AI relies on the unlawful scraping&mdash; theft&mdash; of works that are made solely through the hard-earned time and effort of artists and writers alike who were not even given the opportunity to consent. My degree is in illustration; I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to ensure the financial safety of my future. This has not been the case due to the lack of protection offered for people in my field, and will be hindered even further by the lack of strict action against AI from the US Copyright Office.
