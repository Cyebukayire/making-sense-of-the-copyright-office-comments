Hello,<br/>I really appreciate the space and opportunity to comment on this. Thank you. As an artist myself, the idea that my work could and probably is being used to train AI which mimics my art style is terrifying. This is also a problem with current US copyright law, where authors and creatives are supposed to be able to own their own work. Actors, voice actors, comedians, writers, and all other creatives are also being affected by this. This blatant stealing of works is then seen by proponents of AI as somehow being their own original work- which it is not. The US government needs to get ahead of this terrible practice and put laws in place that put creatives back in control of their own work and IP, and limit the use of AI that trains on and scrapes data from peoples work without their consent. <br/>Again, thank you for the space to talk about this, and I really hope you will take this into consideration. Just as a counterfeit dollar bill shouldn&rsquo;t fly, as it&rsquo;s just a copy of the real thing and undermines real currency, so too should AI art be under stricter laws to not undermine people&rsquo;s IP and jobs as creatives.
