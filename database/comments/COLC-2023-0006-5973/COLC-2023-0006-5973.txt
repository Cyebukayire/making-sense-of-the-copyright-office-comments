AI is a misnomer. These are complex algorithms, which while potentially useful, are often predicated on the use of databases/work that do not belong to them. Something, whether music or photography, art  sculpture, writing or code, being posted online and able to be found on a search engine does not mean it no longer belongs to the person who made it or business that owns it. To create anything with an algorithm that uses the unlicensed work of others is theft.
