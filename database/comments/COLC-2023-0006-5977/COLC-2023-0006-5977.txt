Generative AI is already being used to devalue artists and their work, to cut jobs, and to cut pay, because corporations believe they can produce something &#39;good enough&#39; with AI. <br/><br/>Copyrighted works should not ever be used to train AI models without compensation. This isn&#39;t a new or complicated idea. &#39;Stock images&#39; available to purchase to use and transform in art have existed for decades. Those are what should be used to train AI. Scraping the internet, stealing artwork, and purposefully impersonating artists is not acceptable. And in the case of using AI to replicate a person&#39;s voice, it&#39;s particularly invasive.<br/><br/>Content produced through generative AI should simply not be allowed to be copyrighted. Particularly if the content was generated with data that involves copyrighted works that were acquired without permission. Giving this content copyright communicates that theft and exploitation is acceptable if it allows corporations to cut costs, and that the individuals that do all the actual work the AI systems are trained off of (and that AI systems literally can&#39;t function without) are expendable, and do not deserve compensation.<br/><br/>To say that AI doesn&#39;t impact the lives of artists, or is the &#39;natural next step&#39; in the mixing of technology and art, is a purposefully ignorant stance. Artists at the forefront of their industries are having their names fed into AI like Midjourney with the intent to create content that looks exactly like the artist&#39;s work, and to say that won&#39;t impact their careers and livelihood is insane. And on top of that, many generative AI&#39;s take fees to produce content through them, 0% of which is distributed to the artists being emulated, whose work is being used. It is not transformative in the way fair use allows things to be transformed. The way generative AI&#39;s function right now, without restrictions on what can be used to train them, is no better than a moneymaking scam.<br/><br/>AI is not the same as &#39;people learning from each other&#39;, the way artists naturally do. AI is not &#39;people&#39;. No person is learning something in this situation. AI can often feel magical and amazing and like it can be directly compared to a human creative mind, but it&#39;s just not the same. It&#39;s an imitation at best.<br/><br/>Fair use is not intended to protect people who are trying to replicate existing work, for the similar purpose or even exact same purpose as the original. It&#39;s not intended to protect people who are trying to gain a commercial benefit off the backs of others, and it&#39;s not intended to protect people who are producing content imitating an artist so that they become in direct competition with the original artist they&#39;re imitating.
