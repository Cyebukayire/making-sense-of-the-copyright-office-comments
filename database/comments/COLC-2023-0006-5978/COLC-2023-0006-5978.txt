How can copyright be granted when a person didn&rsquo;t write the text? Who would copyright belong to? The machine? In all seriousness, it&rsquo;s a ridiculous idea, and also doesn&rsquo;t take into account that the AI was most likely trained on stolen work, constituting a breach of copyright in itself. Until AI can be trained ethically, on text whose authors have specifically opted in to allow this, then I don&rsquo;t believe copyright can or should be granted.
