Artists should be allowed to sue when their art is used to train AI without their permission. And AI generated art should not be copyrightable. It is a useful tool for visualization, but shouldn&#39;t be used as a final product to replace real artists. Furthermore, commissioned art should not be used to generate more art in the same style unless the artist expressly permitted this use in the first place. We wanted a future where humans can do art because robots handle menial tasks, not the other way around. There is no enriching benefit to art created without a human soul
