I am a recent college graduate from art school, and I have spent the last 7 years of my life dedicated to making art and preparing myself for working in the field of animation. With that though, it seems that due to AI, I could not have graduated at a worse time. Constantly, my friends and peers throughout the industry are having their work stolen without permission, and thrown into a program that &#39;reinvents&#39; their work. With that, my peers are never credited, nor are they compensated for the work that is stolen. Instead, it goes to an individual who goes over moral rights, and their entire work consist of stealing and gluing other&#39;s work into something that may be cheap, but lacks the soul and creativity of any work ever actually made. It has become such a critical stance for companies that they will not budge with unions right now for actors and writers, claiming they have every right to put all of their likenesses and work into a program so they do not need to hire them ever again. With that, many people are going out of jobs, and I have very little chances to even start in the industry at the moment. With Artificial Intelligence been used as nothing more than a cheap workaround for paying creatives in the field, I have to wonder how we got here. The dream we had years ago was for Artificial Intelligence to assist with jobs or aspects we do not want to deal with in life, so we could pursue our dream jobs, yet it feels as if the exact opposite has happened. Why should someone who steals work without consent be put on this high pedestal, where copyright acts shouldn&#39;t apply to them? It is the same as something like plagiarism in my eyes, yet why is that looked at harshly while executives still won&#39;t budge on stealing peoples work, let alone their likeness? At the end of the day, Artificial Intelligence should be designated to something of a casual use, never as a threat towards our livelihoods, and having its work unable to be copyrighted.
