The analysis of this issue is crucially important and I hope the US government will find that AI violates basic copyright law in that it steals creative works without the consent of the original authors. AI does not have the ability to create, or to iterate creatively. Without the input of existing stolen works, generative AI would be able to produce nothing. This does not constitute authorship but direct copying, which copyright law is meant to protect against. A person utilising AI to generate visual art work does not contribute anything creatively, and merely utilises a tool which steals.
