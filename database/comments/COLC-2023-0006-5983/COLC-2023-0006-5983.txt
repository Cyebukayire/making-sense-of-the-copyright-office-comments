I am writing today to speak out against the ability for AI generated writing and art to be copyrightable. These programs that generate these artworks and written works could not exist without the theft or material from all over the web that is already copyrighted and (should be) protected. These companies claim that &quot;oh we use so many works that no one person&#39;s pieces can be shown to influence the outcome&quot;. We know this is false by the many, many examples provided by the artists and writers themselves (and if this were true they wouldn&#39;t have to steal people&#39;s work in the first place). What this really is, is large scale theft of copyrighted works with no permission or even notice given to those involved and stolen from. As a visual artist I personally feel violated and would like to see my works protected from these programs as copyright laws should already be doing. If there is failure to act now on these issues, it basically makes copyrighting anything pointless because you have already ceded the rights away here and now. Please do not allow these AI generated programs to be considered that same as an actual, living, human who is physically making their own art and just trying to protect their livelihood. Please do not allow these programs to have the same rights as a person, we need to do better. Thank you for considering my comments.
