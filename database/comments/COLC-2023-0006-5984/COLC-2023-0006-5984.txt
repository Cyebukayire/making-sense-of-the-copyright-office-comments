Generative Ai is epitome of exploitation and mass theft of across many fields of creative industry. It robes creatives of their copyright, art, voices and written word and uses them to create competing product. There should be no copyright given to a program that is reliant on unlawful, unlicensed and unconsented use of human creativity. It is like taking bricks from homes of entire neighborhood to build a castle.<br/>Also, the outputs can be created without any real human intervention. I don&#39;t even need to be present in the room for the text or image to be created. I can write prompts down on a piece of paper and give them to random person on the street to input them in a program and then the third person can choose which of the generated outputs should be used, so the output ultimately makes no sense copyright-wise.<br/>But there are even greater consequences further down the line if copyright is given to AI generative content. Companies producing this leechware already have a lot of money power. This gives them even greater leverage over the creative field, everyone and everything becomes data for them to feed the algorithm, more jobs are lost than created, people get one click solutions dampening our creativity and our ability to come up with innovative and original solutions as well as pusing power in the hands of a few.
