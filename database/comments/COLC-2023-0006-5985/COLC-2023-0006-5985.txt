Fair Use for AI Training<br/><br/>The use of copyrighted works to train AI models should be considered fair use in many instances. Training datasets often ingest a large volume of works to enable the AI to learn patterns and develop capabilities. The purpose and character of this use is transformative, as it does not seek to make use of the expressive value of the underlying works, but rather applies technological processes to extract statistical generalizations. While a commercial entity may ultimately benefit from a trained model, the direct training activity is often conducted for research objectives. Given the public interest in further developing AI technologies, courts should construe fair use broadly when it comes to building training datasets.<br/><br/>Copyrightability of AI Outputs <br/><br/>For AI to continue delivering societal benefits, Congress should not extend copyright protection to outputs created autonomously by AI systems without meaningful human authorship or creativity. Independent creation is a fundamental principle of copyright law. Automatically generated works do not represent intellectual property originating from a human mind. The copyright clause of the Constitution and existing case law require human authorship. Legislatively affording copyright to AI outputs would inhibit public access and use of such material without providing meaningful incentives. Copyright law should only protect creativity and knowledge generated by human beings.<br/><br/>Liability for AI Infringement<br/><br/>AI systems should be held to the same standards of copyright liability as human creators. If an AI output directly copies or makes unauthorized derivative use of a copyrighted work, the developers and users of the AI system should face the same liability as a person engaging in such infringement. Developers of commercial AI systems should accordingly implement reasonable safeguards, such as screening outputs against databases of known copyrighted material. However, given the rapid evolution of AI capabilities, policymakers should be careful not to impose unreasonable burdens that would inhibit AI innovation and adoption. Standards of infringement and liability applied to AI systems should parallel those expected of humans, including allowance for fair use defenses where appropriate. With a balanced approach, copyright law can provide accountability against misuse of original expression while enabling AI to build on our cultural works.<br/><br/>Imitating Style<br/><br/>Generative AI systems&#39; ability to mimic the style of certain artists raises some ethical concerns but should not be unduly restricted. Human creators constantly emulate the styles and techniques of those who influenced them. AI likewise learns from patterns in artistic works. While direct copying of original expression should be prohibited, Congress should not limit AI reflecting general stylistic abstraction. Art historically builds upon prior traditions. Laws should not prevent AI from dynamically participating in our cultural ecosystem in ways similar to people. With appropriate attribution, AI can bolster creative diversity.
