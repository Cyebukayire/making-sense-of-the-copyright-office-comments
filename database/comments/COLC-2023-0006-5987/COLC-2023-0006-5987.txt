Ai created products should not be able to be copyrighted because the intention of copyright is to give credit and protection to things made by people. The Ai cannot give consent to someone to allow its productions to be copyrighted. Also, many Ai models use copyrighted or protected human products to &ldquo;create&rdquo; something. In truth there is nothing new being produced.
