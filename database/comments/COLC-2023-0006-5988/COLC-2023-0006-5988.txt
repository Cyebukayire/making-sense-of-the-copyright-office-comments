Thanks for giving this space. I&acute;m a 2d visual artist and illustrator. I&acute;m greatly concerned about generative IA. In the past months I&acute;ve seen artists get their artwork rights violated, stolen and used without permission by models made with stable difussion and such. Job have been taken, and artists have been harrased by gen AI users. On top of peoples seeing their livelihoods threatened by this, because there have been less and less jobs in the industry,  I believe the arts and creative disciplines should be about human expressions, not programs, not machines. It&acute;s what connects community, people, and Gen AI is taking that away.
