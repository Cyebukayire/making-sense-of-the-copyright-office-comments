Hello,<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>My name is Justen Moore a freelance graphic artist working mostly in the game industry. I am sending this comment to tell the U.S. Copyright Office how generative AI has negatively affected me.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Due to AI generated images I have had to remove images off of social media, my portfolios, and other methods I use to get work because my own art is being used against me. Daily hundreds of thousands of AI generated images are being posted to art portfolios and art sites with advertisements of how they can make artworks for clients for low fees. They also pretend to be popular artists by having the AI generators directly copy an artists style none of this with the artists permission and ruining the reputation of artists through this fraudulent activity.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The AI image generators use a dataset that scraped data from the entire internet that includes copyrighted materials and private information all under the bubble of research. Once these groups had a working algorithm by scraping existing artworks they offered it to the public to get people hooked then started charging fees. AI images have a particular issue where most of what they generate is unusable so users will keep generating more images but to generate more the users have to pay more in a slot machine style gamble. The more that is generated the more they need the artworks or the real artists not generated by AI to fix the problems with the AI in a never ending cycle of theft and exploitation.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Artists were never asked to opt-in to have their work use and instead we have to go to their sites to opt-out, sites we never had interactions with in a process that requires us to go image by image hoping to find all the duplicates they have fed into the AI. AI image generators should be opt-in by default not opt-out and the prompting should be limited so names of artists or websites cannot be used to generate images.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Some ideas to fix some of the problems is to require AI generators to have a large watermark placed at the center of the image. Limit how finished the AI generated image can be so the image is more abstract or impressionistic that way it is more of a step in a process that a real artist can finish instead of something they have to compete against. AI algorithms should be limited un-copyrighted materials or paid for licensed materials so artists can be paid for their work as it should be. AI generated image users should be required to say the image is AI generated if posted on art or portfolio sites possibly even banning raw unedited AI images. Ban the use of AI to generate pornographic images because a large use of these generators is to make porn and deep fake porn images of real people including children.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I know AI can have it&#39;s uses but the way it is being used now is largely unethical and appears to be just a get rich scheme taking advantage of an area that is not regulated. There are some companies involved that see it as a way to automate and fire human workers cut costs. Something artists have encountered specifically with Artstation was Epic Games ordering Arstation to stamp out protests against AI because Epic Games is researching AI and owns Arstation which is a portfolio site for professional artists which AI generated images has no business being on.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We are watching and staying very informed on the subject. We are aware of the meeting on AI that happened behind closed doors where the majority of the people were CEOs of corporations that do not want regulations and want our hard work as free use to put us out of business.
