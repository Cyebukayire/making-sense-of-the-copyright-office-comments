AI works are made by using other works. No part of an AI generated creation is 100% original. Even if someone is using a &quot;base&quot; that they own, the generated work is made with a tool that was fed works that belong to many others in order to &#39;learn&#39;. At best, AI should be used as a form of brain storming and not for completed works that would require copyright.
