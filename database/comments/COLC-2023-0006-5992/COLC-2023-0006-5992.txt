A.I is being used to take people&#39;s art work and writing without giving credit. This is a violation of intellectual property. A.I. having access to people&#39;s google doc accounts, to public websites, and other art or writing based websites is wrong and thievery. I no longer use Google Docs because google has made no declaration stating that it is willing to protect peoples&#39; documents. In fact, a recent Google update gave indication that it would actively be allowing A.I to be trained on  people&#39;s documents. <br/>As a writer, I do not want nor ever want my work to be used to train and A.I. I put my time, effort, and care into and I want to know that it isnt being used for someone else to take. <br/>A.I. goes against intellectual property and intellectual rights and frequently do so with out people&#39;s permission. It needs stopped.<br/>Thank you for your time. Protect intellectual property and stop A.I.
