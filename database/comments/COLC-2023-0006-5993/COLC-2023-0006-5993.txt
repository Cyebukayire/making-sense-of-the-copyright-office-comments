The ethics when it comes to generative AI is little or not at all considered by the makers/programmers and/or the distributors, using huge datasets with some containing billions of images and millions of copyrighted images, and purposefully ignoring the critics and the cries of the public of how it can be a potentially harmful technology, and not addressing the dubious uses of the technology. My comment will be about visual digital art, since I&#39;m a digital artist.<br/><br/>To get it out first, in my opinion and my understanding, AI art is not able to apply for fair use simply by the fact it can be used to compete with the artist and even create a perfect substitute of the artist, harming the individual economically. The recent explosion of this type of technology and the little that was done to stop it created a huge mental health decay for artist, mainly freelancers, since it could potentially end their live hoods, justifiably, because there is already some cases of artist starting to decline the number of clients. <br/><br/>As an artist, I believe that this type of AI is not the right way of using the potentially highly useful technology, using to replace artist, and there are applications in art, as in for creating references, for example. But it is clear that is not been used this way, it been created to take the human out the art with no consideration of how it will affect artist of witch could make a live hood with it. I personally, don&#39;t think it should be banned, but it should definitely be more regulated, AI has proven to be very useful in some fields like medicine, identifying disease quicker than medical professional, this accuracy could be a live and death situation, but I still think is wrong to use AI to replace medics in our hospitals, but it can be a very useful tool for the medical professional.<br/><br/>And there is the bad, when people start to use the technology for dubious or harmful mean, creating pornography of real people with out their consent, and even criminal images as in allegedly child pornography, and the makers/programmers of the AI seems to not be worried about this type of content, since nothing was done to stop this bad actors, even if it is a very small minority of people making this type of content, it does not mean that is nothing to worry about, one person could make thousands upon thousands of images. And some digital influencers have voice their concerned about the creation of pornography using their imagery. <br/><br/>There are a need to compensation for the artist, as in royalties, for their art to be used in the training of the AI if they agree in the first place to them to use their art for AI training, and maybe stronger ways to artists to reinforce their copyrights in online space, as in for datasets for example, more legal ways to an artist live without worrying that could be replaced at anytime with no explanation. And companies distributing the technology should make upon themselves to minimize or completely eradicate the harm cause by bad actors, not turn a blind eye and move on with the technology, a great way would be to know who created the image as in some digital signature, that could be traced back to the user.
