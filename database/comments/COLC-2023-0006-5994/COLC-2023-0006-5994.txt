Companies that adopt the use of generative AI are not only seeking to replace hard-working creatives as means of cutting costs, but are also supporting a product that has scraped the work of thousands of artists, writers and internet users (including confidentia/ private data) to use as the basis for its dataset (see Laion dataset, for example) without their knowledge or consent. It should be illegal for companies to make use of the products of these datasets when developing commercial works, and allowing this to go unchecked sets an incredibly dangerous precedent, legally and ethically.
