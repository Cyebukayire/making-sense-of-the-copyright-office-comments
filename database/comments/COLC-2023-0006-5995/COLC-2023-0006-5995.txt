AI in creative fields such as visual art, voice acting or voice generation, writing, or any other medium by which content can be &quot;automatically&quot; generated by algorithms trained on human-produced material, is a very, very bad idea. It removes jobs from creatives, who are already frequently struggling to make ends meet in their gig, self employed status. It takes away the right of bodily autonomy for creatives like voice actors, and AI software also frequently infringes upon copywritten material by scraping images and text from the internet illegally. I wholly oppose the use of AI for this kind of generative content, because I feel it is infringing on our self-expression, our ability to create new things, and capability of living off of our hard work and years of training. I feel like this is an &quot;easy power grab&quot; from folks who think anything on the internet is free use, and who want to be able to type specific strings of words and then claim the content the algorithm creates is theirs. I fear for the day computers automatically generate our art and entertainment, resulting in an endless rehashing of the things that already exist and the loss of countless jobs for real people--and not just for artists creating paintings. Personnel in advertisement and marketing, music production, book and magazine editing, news distribution, website and software developers, all lay squarely in the line of fire if this AI generative software trend continues to expand beyond the artistic fields. We must draw the line on where software can produce material for human consumption, and we must do so swiftly and decisively, without letting the CEOs of the AI tech companies define the future of their creations without restraint.
