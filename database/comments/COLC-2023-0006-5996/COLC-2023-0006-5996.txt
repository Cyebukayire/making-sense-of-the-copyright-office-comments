Generative AI is dangerous to the livelihood of nearly every artist, writer, and thousands of other professions. It will have an impact on hundreds of professions and industries outside of merely artists. It will impact film making, website design, secretarial work, blue collar coding jobs, and onwards. The impact of generative AI is a risk to many jobs, but it starts at creative fields, and an oversaturation of the market with low effort, low moral shill work. <br/><br/>Long term, it has risks of effecting economic growth by blocking off doors for people entering fields for the first time, and enables swindlers to put themselves in positions they are completely unsuited for. <br/><br/>AI benefits swindlers in the same way Non-Fungible Tokens once did. They are for criminals and those without morals to speak of who only seek their own benefit over their fellow man.
