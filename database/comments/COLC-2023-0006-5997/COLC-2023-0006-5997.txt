AI models should not be permitted to train on copyrighted materials, unless the individual or company owning or using the AI model has purchased the right to do so. AI generated images, text, audio, and video should not be possible to copyright. The generated content is not the result of human effort or ingenuity; it is the result of art theft. AI generated content has negatively impacted small-scale artists, robbing them of potential income. <br/><br/>
