Generative AI is stealing. It profits off scraping the uncompensated collective works of others without permission. It should be illegal to be sold and distributed as it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;fair use&quot; to the artist who AI steals from while artist today can barely make money from the works they use in an already saturated market. There has been numerous times when artist, even some who have recently passed, where their work has been feed into an AI without permission and others use prompts to try to profit off it. That should be illegal and AI generators should have some regulations regarding to what is fed into them and how moderators get their images from so that actual artist can be properly compensated.<br/> AI is a very neat tool to use and even can be helpful, but its way to easily abused and we need laws to ensure artist won&#39;t be hurt by people who take advantage of our skills.<br/> Please don&#39;t allow AI kill me and my fellow artist.
