AI content and material should absolutely not be copyrighted. The technology is made with material scraped, possibly illegally, from the internet stealing the thoughts, feelings, talent, and livelihood of true creatives. To allow AI to be copyrighted would be a slap in a face to the people whose work was stolen to make it. <br/>On top of that, copyrighting something is to show proof of ownership over something that a human thought of and made. AI material is nothing more than entering a prompt and getting something mashed together from someone elses hard work. If a monkey can&#39;t copyright their own picture then a computer can&#39;t copyright its output.<br/>It also runs the risk of infringing on other, already established copyrights due to the nature of how it was creating. Most of the data used to train AI is unvetted, with legal problems already beginning to spring up as some companies and individuals are filing lawsuits against AI companies.<br/>Please, do not allow AI content to be copyrighted. Artists, writers, creatives everywhere are begging you to not allow AI material to be copyrighted.
