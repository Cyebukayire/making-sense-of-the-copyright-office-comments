AI generated work (written or  visual) cannot be copywrited because anything an AI produces has been generated by leeching off of human creators without their permission. Writers and artists post their work online to be enjoyed by their audiences, not to be scraped and exploited by people who are largely looking to make a quick buck and to spit in the faces of artists. They refuse to put in the work themsleves to hone a craft and many of them have nothing but spite and malice for people with real skill. People who use AI do so in bad faith. Replacing writers and artists in the world with AI is so dystopian and wrong and it should not be supported by law.
