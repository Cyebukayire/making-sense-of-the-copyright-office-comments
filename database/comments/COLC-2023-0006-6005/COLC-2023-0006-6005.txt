Attempting to subject AI works to copyright will have catastrophic consequences, as it will ignite a race to generate as many works as possible just to be the first to claim their use. Normally, a copyrighted work requires time and effort to create, which serves as a natural barrier of entry to prevent this sort of abuse. With AI, this will no longer be the case, and we will see a significant increase in claims made in bad faith as this becomes an incentivized business model.<br/><br/>Additionally, most AI models are trained on data that they do not have rights to in the first place.
