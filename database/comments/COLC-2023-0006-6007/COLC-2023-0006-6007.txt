AI and similar machine learning as it pertains to creative fields just as art, writing, etc, jeopardizes the integrity of not just a robust and diverse workforce, but the very definition of creativity itself. It depends on astounding amounts of real world artists&#39;s original creations (protected innately by copyright law) as unwilling or unknowing data points to create facsimiles without their knowing, and possibly profiting of their work. AI should not be an excuse to circumvent a creator&#39;s copyright or bastardize fair use. The scope of AI as it pertains to copyright issues should be limited as much as possible to safeguard the copyright of works that matter: those created by humans and not machines.
