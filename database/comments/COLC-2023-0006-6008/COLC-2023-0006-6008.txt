AI has already completely disrupted the animation industry in a way that is putting many artists out of work while benefiting from what they had contributed in the past. Many studios have been using their back catalogs of work and shows to create their own AI sources to avoid copyright issues. It&#39;s work they own that they paid for years ago. However, that work is being used to generate backgrounds, characters, scripts, and further assets for new programs that are preventing artists from working those same jobs. Essentially studios are paying once and benefiting indefinitely while artists suffer and lose the rights to all their work. No longer are we being paid for contributions, but seemingly a low &quot;resource collection fee&quot;. It&#39;s highly unethical, but because of the lack of regulation, there&#39;s nothing we can do about it. There needs to be regulations in place that prevent the use of AI replacing the use of human work. It&#39;s not a tool if it is being used to limit the number of human workers and benefit from it.
