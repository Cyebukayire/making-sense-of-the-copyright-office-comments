I&#39;m absolutely appalled by A.I art. It doesn&#39;t enrichen anything, steals from artist, and only ties down the art world. Not only the art world, but all of the creative process, movies, music, paintings. Why do people need or want these jobs if A.I will flood it all with pointless, stolen, uninspired art? The culture of art creates the world around us, if this is the case then A.I will only create mediocrity. The human race might as well cease, if A.I will just do everything for us, but poorly.
