I believe the way artificial intelligence learns isn&rsquo;t too different from how humans learn and model weights should not be subject to training material copyrights anymore than a humans memories are subject to the copyrights of books they read. The litmus test for determining whether the model is truly learning can be figuring out whether it can synthesize new information or if the model is a lot smaller than the training set (indicating the information has been synthesized).
