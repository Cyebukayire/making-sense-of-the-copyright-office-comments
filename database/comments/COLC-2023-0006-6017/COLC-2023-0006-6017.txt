AI, or anything computer generated, is not creating in a vacuum. It is &ldquo;learning&rdquo; from existing copyright works. It is taking something made by a human, or many humans, and approximating a creation. If not for what has already been created or input by humans, it wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make anything. It is both theft, and should not be able to be copywritten.<br/>AI generated works should be clearly marked as AI generated.<br/>AI works that include a name, facial likeness, or voice likeness should be marked as AI generated and should belong to the person who&rsquo;s name, face, or voice is used.
