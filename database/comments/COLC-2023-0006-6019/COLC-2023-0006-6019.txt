Generative AI trained on artists&#39; work without adequate compensation is equivalent to both plagiarism and piracy. It is fundamentally different from an artist&#39;s work &quot;inspiring&quot; another artist because the original artist&#39;s work is quantifiably necessary in the production of the output. In this way generative AI is closer to using a piece of software to produce art, such as Autodesk&#39;s Maya or Adobe&#39;s photoshop. The theft of these pieces of software is against the law and therefore AI should also have to obtain its inputs legitimately.<br/><br/>A lack of protection of artists&#39; rights against AI also damages the market for their art, and therefore their already meager livings. This will in turn cause fewer artists to be able to create for a living, which will cause there to be less art in the world. AI will not &quot;pick up the slack&quot; here for two reasons: <br/>A: AI art is not designed with intent and is not equally deliberate or stimulating as real art. An artist&#39;s actions in their respective processes are deliberate, and designed to create an emotion. AI, at best, simply tries to mimic these decisions without a fundamental understanding of what made the original&#39;s composition exceptional.<br/>B: Generative AI by design requires new art to function. If it is allowed to &quot;corner the market&quot; per se it will starve out its own host, and will functionally implode on itself. AI trained on other images created by AI eventually dissolves into worthless noise.<br/><br/>It is also worth mentioning that proponents of AI champion how it makes art more accessible. This is not true. Art is already accessible- anybody can pick up a pencil and draw. this is a red herring argument posited by two groups: those who wish to use AI to parasitize art by legitimate artists, and companies wishing to pay fewer artists. Neither of these groups have the interests of the craftsmen or artists at heart. They are in it for their own profits over any altruism.<br/><br/>As a software developer I personally believe generative AI&#39;s adoption is inevitable, and there are precedents for this in places such as the journalism and automotive production industries. But unlike most of the precedents the art industry is not a slog. Art is a joy to create for those who create it. As a country we should strive to preserve things people enjoy, especially if they also provide them careers. A robot trained on the greatest golfer&#39;s swings that could always hit a hole in one would not make golf &quot;more accessible,&quot; nor would a racecar that could drive a perfect lap every time. These things wouldn&#39;t be allowed in their respective environments since they would ruin the entire industry. In the same way we should strive to preserve the art industry as a whole to prevent it from being overwhelmed and sanitized by generative AI.
