While AI can be a powerful tool that can help boost productivity and workflows, it must not come at the cost of stealing the work of human beings, for the sole purpose of churning cheap and mass-produced &#39;products&#39; for profit. Training data should be transparent and publicly available while clearly communicating to the public from where/what source the training data was pulled from. <br/><br/>Training data should be used WITH consent from the original creators.<br/>Content created by AI should either have no copyright (so that anyone can use it), or be copyrighted so that it belongs to all original creators in the training data it used.<br/>If used wrongfully and without consent, original creators should be paid royalties and compensation.<br/><br/>AI is not sentient, it does not &#39;think,&#39; it can only do what the user tells it to do. There will always be people who will use it to bastardize human work in order to make a profit, therefore it there should be proper regulations, restrictions, and enforcement of it. Without people, there is no AI.
