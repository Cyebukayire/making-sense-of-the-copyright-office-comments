Simply put, unfettered and unregulated Ai content generation is anti-consumer, Anti-worker, and poses high overall risk to this country&#39;s governing bodies. Presently AI generated content, be it in visual and audio form, presents many a problems. First and foremost Ai generative artworks, be it visual art of music, cannot exist in of itself without theft- this is FACT. AI content generation requires a database from which to pull already existing artworks and audio materials from as a &quot;source&quot; for the image or song it&#39;s creating. More often than not, this &quot;source&quot; material is uploaded to the databases AI generative content uses without the consent or in a lot of cases, KNOWLEDGE of the original creator. This is known in the online world as &quot;scraping&quot; and has become a rampant problem for nearly all forms of creative work. Bad actors who participate in scraping in many cases present the AI generative content as being entirely their product created in full, by themselves, when the artwork presented was created using pieces of the already existing work that was dubiously uploaded to the generators. It is theft of someone else&#39;s work, style, and brand, and is not limited to individual creatives, as in most cases, any bad actor can submit any images freely to the generators, including works copyrighted by widely known companies, IE Disney, Sony, Warner Brothers, etc.<br/><br/>But not only is Ai generative works a threat to creative work, it also holds the potential to threaten both individuals&#39; personal safety as well as the Public&#39;s. So called &quot;Ai Experts&quot; have proposed on multiple occasions that at present, AI content is at it&#39;s &quot;worst&quot; state, meaning from this point it will only improve on its ability to replicate audio and visual media. As it stands now, AI users have used AI to modulate the voices of many well-known individuals like The current and past presidents, celebrities, and countless others. As of right now this AI generative voice technology is being used as a funny internet fad, but if left unregulated, it poses a risk to bad actors using this technology to manipulate the voices and even likenesses of everyday citizens, celebrities, members of congress, and even world leaders, for nefarious purposes. Simply put: AI generative content, like Deepfakes, could be used in a manipulative and dangerous way in the VERY near future if left unregulated.<br/><br/>The reason I bring up both of these instances of current and very possible malicious use, is because I really want to cement the danger that unmitigated AI usage can bring about not just to creative work, but to public safety as well. This is a subject that NECESSITATES feedback as well as scrutiny in order to form any laws upon because it poses damage at all levels- to the individual creator, to the companies, to the legislative bodies. No individual nor company should be able to use consent-less, AI Generative content to exploit workers in the creative field for their own self-serving and or malicious purposes.
