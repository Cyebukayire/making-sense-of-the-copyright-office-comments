Artificial Intelligence is detrimental to my livelihood. As an artist I frequently post on social media, these AI bots comb the internet for images and art and use them to generate their content. This makes what the AI &ldquo;creates&rdquo; and amalgamation of my and other artists work. Illegally using our art and reproducing it. I am worried also for the future of my field, as many book publishers are starting to use AI due to it being cheaper than hiring a designer or an artist. AI cannot exist without the talent of real actual human beings creating content for it to pick apart and smash together. It is a bastardization of art as we know it!
