Machine-generation is itself just as viable a method of content creation as anything, however the datasets that current AI are trained off of are overrun with stolen and otherwise unethically acquired images and text, and therefore the products of those datasets cannot and should not be considered for copyright protection. <br/><br/>Before copyright consideration can take place, the methods by which generative AI is trained need to be formally regulated in law. Already unregulated AI scraping has resulted in millions of dollars worth of IP theft, and the victims are almost always people who lack the means to pursue reparations against the thieves. It would be adding insult to injury if the products of that stolen IP are then placed under copyright protection that the victims themselves are denied.
