1. Generative AI does not produce copyrightable works, as they are not human authors. At best, a human author may make claim over their &quot;prompts&quot; into the system, but in most cases those prompts are little more than ideas, and ideas are not copyrightable.<br/>2. The current state of generative AI models is that of rampant copyright infringement. Generative AI models consume vast amounts of input art without permission, then slam that art into what&#39;s little more than a lossy compression algorithm and statistical model. By definition, these models can&#39;t create anything new. Rather, they are an algorithmic patchwork assembler, taking pieces from different works they have consumed to generate their output.<br/><br/>The Constitution says:<br/><br/>[Congress shall have power] To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.<br/><br/>The progress of science and useful arts are not promoted by allowing the vapid generation of art and text built on massive infringement. In the case of visual art, generative AI has the capability to destroy the entire industry and community of artists without which it couldn&#39;t even exist. In the case of text, not only is the useful work of countless people being infringed and supplanted by AI output, but much of this output is incorrect! As an example, there are mushroom identification books, for sale on Amazon, written by generative AI. Mushrooms are famously difficult to identify and classify, and it&#39;s only a matter of time before someone literally dies because a generative AI book told them they could eat a poisonous mushroom.<br/><br/>All generative AI models should be considered to be illegal tools of infringement, unless the models are built on non-infringing works (public domain or licensed). Even then, what is produced by the model cannot be copyrighted because it has no human author.
