Artificial Intelligence can and one day hopefully will be a wonderful tool to help improve human lives. But as with all new or growing technologies their are always interlopers willing to exploit it, to aid them in the exploitation of other humans.  Due to the speed and of A.I. it can be used for more new and surprising levels of Exploitation and abuse than other technologies before it.  This is a very serious issue but it it needs proper investigation and regulation. Generative A.I. can and very often up till now has been content based off of the stolen works of living human creators.  When a human orders an A.I., its a generation by reassembling data, and thus I feel any generated content from an A.I. is not in its self a creation made by a human, and such generated material from A.I. should not be able to be copyrighted.  A Copyright should be a form of protection for an idea from a sentient living being and not a non-sentient A.I. that reassembles data.
