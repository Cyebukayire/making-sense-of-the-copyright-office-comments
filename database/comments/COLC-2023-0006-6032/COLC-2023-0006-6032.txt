AI &quot;art&quot; is a bastardization of what art really is. Not only that but it&#39;s theft. There is no creation behind AI. Plugging in a series of key words and letting an algorithm rip images from the internet isn&#39;t creative, skillful, or in any way remarkable. It&#39;s theft. Real artists worked to create the images that are being torn apart and smashed back together into horrendous depictions. Without the art, sculptures, concepts, works, and photography of real people throughout history, AI would have literally nothing. It is nothing in itself. It uses no tools, no skill, no human artistry to create anything. It has to steal existing works to make warped imagery and disfigured creations. Nothing about that should exist and it&#39;s appalling that anyone would try to claim copyright on their AI &quot;art&quot;. They didn&#39;t create any of it! If someone were to rip portions of paintings apart from a museum and tape them back together, would we really let them claim creation and rights to that? Do they really get a say over this horrid abstract that they had no real part in the concept, creation, finalization, and recognition of? Something they spent literally no time, thought, or effort on? AI &quot;art&quot; is a disgraceful act of theft and should never be allowed to claim copyright or ownership over.
