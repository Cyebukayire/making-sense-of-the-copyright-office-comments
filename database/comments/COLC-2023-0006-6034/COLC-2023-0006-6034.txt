the current version of generative AI is incapable of creating unique or new content. it only functions to recognize patterns in existing content and re-order sections to give the impression of new ideas. looking forward to the possibility of an AI capable of creating truly new content, the idea that it could be copyrighted would need to be limited to those which could provide evidence that the entire learnset(database used to generate the AI) of the algorithm was copyright free or licensed material. additionally allowing for AI copyrights under the current system of copyright enforcement heavily encourages bad actors to utilize an AI to create a massive log of functionally random content and do the bare minimum to hold copyright on those things either to grant carte-blanch free use of them to the public functionally removing the point of copyright or to use those holding to endlessly dispute other persons use of similar ideas or methods. in summary the current form of AI isn&#39;t capable of creating meaningfully copyrightable works, the current system of copyright would not be able to survive allowing AI works to be freely copyrighted, and any future system of allowing AI to create copyrighted works would need extensive legislation on the restrictions of copyrighted works and public accessibility for the learnsets of those AI. thank you for your time.
