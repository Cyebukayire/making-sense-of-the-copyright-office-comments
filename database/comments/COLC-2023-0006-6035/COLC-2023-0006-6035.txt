## Introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;Copyright protection and AI training are two critical areas that need to be harmonized for the betterment of society. While copyright laws protect creators and encourage innovation, restricting AI from learning from such copyrighted material could limit its potential to contribute positively to human lives.&quot;<br/><br/>## Main Points:<br/><br/>1. **Training on Copyrighted Material**:  <br/>    AI models should be allowed to train on copyrighted material under a modified &#39;fair use&#39; doctrine. This would enable the AI to generate more accurate and contextually rich responses, thereby increasing its utility.<br/>    <br/>2. **Compensation for Authors**:  <br/>    When copyrighted material is explicitly requested from the AI, a mechanism should be in place to compensate the original authors. This not only respects intellectual property rights but also encourages future creative contributions.<br/>    <br/>3. **Blockchain Tracking**:  <br/>    A transparent and immutable tracking system, potentially based on blockchain technology, could be implemented to log these explicit requests. This would serve as the basis for compensating the original authors.<br/>    <br/><br/>## Challenges and Considerations:<br/><br/>1. **Blockchain Scalability**:  <br/>    &quot;While blockchain offers transparency and security, the scalability and computational cost are concerns. However, newer blockchain technologies are addressing these issues, making it a viable option for the long term.&quot;<br/><br/>## Conclusion:<br/><br/>&quot;The harmonization of copyright laws and AI training is not just a legal necessity but a moral imperative. By allowing AI models to train on copyrighted material and implementing a transparent compensation mechanism, we can foster innovation while respecting and rewarding creativity.&quot;<br/><br/>
