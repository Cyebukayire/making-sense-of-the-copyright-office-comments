Artists are getting scammed by ai, they deserve proper crediting and financial compensation for their work being used (as well as permission from the artists themselves!) Not just visual artists either, writers, photographers, really anything, even fanfiction authors who do all of their work for non commercial benefit. There may be a place for ai in medical circumstances like scanning for cancers (that are THOROUGHLY regulated) . Public health and helping people i think is appropriate! For art? Not so much
