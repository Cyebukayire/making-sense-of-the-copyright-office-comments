Hi, AI by design steals from the work of others, without their consent, and uses their content to generate money for the AI company. The fact that other&#39;s, often private work is used to train the programs is a violation of copyright, and the fact that the original creator receives no compensation for their part in the AI&#39;s evolution adds insult to injury. The AI industry is quickly becoming a race to the bottom scenario, where new additions to the field have to figure out how to steal other&#39;s work faster and more efficiently. If AI cannot exist without appropriating the work of others, then the very idea of AI is unethical. Please respect the copyright of others by forbidding AI companies from using works without the creator&#39;s consent at the very least, with the option of compensation. The massive scale of the data mining AI uses puts this outside the scope of &quot;transformative works&quot;, especially since the programs cannot generate anything truly original without said mining.
