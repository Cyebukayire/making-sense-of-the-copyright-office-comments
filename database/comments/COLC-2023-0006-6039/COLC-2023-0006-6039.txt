AI has been detrimental to all artist and writers and more. Its been used to cheat in school, steal art, replace writers, and make people say thing they don&#39;t. AI currently has no bases to be used right now in our systems. they are built with stolen data and copywrite protected art and writing pumped into it to produce the equivalent of barely changed art that you cant tell who made. this is loosing real people business with stolen work and false promises. i would suggest AI not be allowed to copyright anything at the current time as no AI in the modern erra can produce non stolen work.
