Melinda Pryor<br/><br/>I personally as the future animator, I&rsquo;m still a student. I am not comfortable with the idea that AI is trying to replace the job that I&rsquo;ve spent years learning how to do. I&rsquo;m fine with AI filters just being silly little entertainment like Instagram filters or tictok filters. Because those are silly forms of entertainment. But as far as making our movies, films, animations, and VFX, or even our books. I am not comfortable with that and I don&rsquo;t think it should take from jobs that are in a creative form. Because the people who make them use their real life experiences, it&rsquo;s a part of who they are. The creative experience is supposed to be the human experience. Sure if AI becomes something like Pinterest. Then it wouldn&rsquo;t be the worst thing, so long as it&rsquo;s only a tool to help and not something that creates something for you completely. If I find out a movie is AI , I&rsquo;m going to boycott it. If I find out art is AI. I&rsquo;m not going to buy it. I simply do not care how good it looks. I want art to stay the human experience. The only place aI has is to be for silly little forms of entertainment, and to be used as a tool to help that&rsquo;s it.<br/>Thank you for your time.
