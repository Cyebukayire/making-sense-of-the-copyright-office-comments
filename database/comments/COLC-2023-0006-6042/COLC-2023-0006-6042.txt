As an independent artist I do not want it to be an inherent given that my employer is allowed to use my artwork in AI datasets, as they are only looking to decrease the amount of work given to me and therefore the amount paid to me. I don&rsquo;t believe anything created by AI without express and explicit consent from the original creator of works used to contribute to its datasets should be allowed to be copywritten. I also don&rsquo;t believe websites should be allowed to use their user base in order to get an AI dataset, and if they do want to do so, the user must be allowed to opt out permanently from this. The website should also be required to explicitly state where this option is. Thank you for your time.
