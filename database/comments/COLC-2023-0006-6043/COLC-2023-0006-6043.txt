Hello, my name is Gavin Herman. I am a part time writer and I do not believe that AI works, or works derived from AI should be copyrightable. While an argument can be made that AI works would count as &quot;transformative&quot;, there is a difference between inspiration from someone and a data learning program using someone&#39;s work without their permission. Especially since prompts given to these AIs include &quot;in the style of this artist&quot;. This isn&#39;t even counting the example of AI voice creation that uses sound banks made from performers and public officials without permission from said individuals.Thus, AI created works shouldn&#39;t have the same rights as flesh-and-blood creators if it accounts to a certain form of plagiarism.
