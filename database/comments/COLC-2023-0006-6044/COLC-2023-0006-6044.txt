I have been drawing and playing with colours all my life, since I had the dexterity to do so. I only have a handful of digital artwork since I got my first drawing tablet five years ago. I was planning on honing my skills and building up a portfolio. With AI running rampant with art theft at the forefront of its programming, I cannot post about my recent pieces without the fear of it being stolen and copyrighted without my consent. Any pride from the hours spent, meticulously going over tiny details for each painting, is now replaced with anxiety. As an artist, I feel that AI would rob other creative people of their talent for a quick buck. That&#39;s not right! That destroys any opportunity for aspiring artists to put themselves out there and show off their skills.
