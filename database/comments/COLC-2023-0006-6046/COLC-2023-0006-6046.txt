Independent artists who make their living off of producing unique and incredible artwork on commissions are being replaced by AIs trained on their own stolen work. As an artist and supporter of artists, please protect creatives from being exploited by massive AI corporations and losing dream jobs to these thieves. AI is a powerful tool that can be used to uplift artists, but allowing AI to steal work without permission to train itself is vagrant piracy.
