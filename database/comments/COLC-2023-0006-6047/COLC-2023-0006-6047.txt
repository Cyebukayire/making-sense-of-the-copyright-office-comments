AI art should be treated the same as a human using photoshop. <br/><br/>At the bare bones of it, that&#39;s what it is. Taking images and meshing them together. <br/>Examples of this can be seen in images being generated with the shutterstock watermark. Alternatively, when Artstation was protesting use of their artworks in AI art, many images were generated with &#39;Ai&#39; in white text enclosed in the general prohibition sign. There have been private medical records found in training data for the AI program &#39;LAION&#39;, which not only violates copyright but also HIPPA. <br/><br/>Potential options:<br/>1) All images used in the training data must have explicit consent to be used commercially, with alteration, and without credit necessary.<br/><br/>2) There must be a built in way for the resulting AI image to credit the specific art pieces that were referenced, with a disclaimer that the artists may not endorse whatever image is generated. This opens up the potential for AI programs to use images that are commercially available, with alteration, with credit, and potentially add a revenue option for people that contribute to the AI training set if their image is referenced. <br/><br/>A program written by humans should have to comply with copyright the same as any other human. A human using a tool still needs to follow human laws. Whether it&#39;s photoshop, generated interpolation in animation, or AI - ultimately, they are all tools that a human uses. <br/><br/>As such, the situations in which an AI generated image can be used in commercial works must depend on the licensing of the training data.
