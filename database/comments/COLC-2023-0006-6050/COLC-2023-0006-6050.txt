The situation is simple:<br/>&quot;Ai&quot; or machine learning software is just code, not people.<br/>So fair use or whatnot does not apply to the companies in question.<br/>These LLMs are generated by bulk data collection and post-processing of such data.<br/>We can say without a doubt that, when the algorithms are run, they are run by using these works, or a product of these works as a basis. Most experts will tell you that these models are plagiarism machines, and that they are.<br/><br/>The solution is to either enforce the current laws and expand their scope, or create new ones that establish that:<br/>-companies creating such models have to license any and all contents, from content creators<br/>-companies have to publicly disclose what data they used from where and how, in a way that govt can verify if necessary.<br/>-previous licenses to use content automatically DO NOT apply to these new licenses and will have to be drafted that do cover &quot;ai uses&quot;.<br/><br/>This is also a good time to re-evaluate the search engine and social network situation, and to apply the same logic to those bulk data collection operations.<br/>This issue will come around sooner or later, and it has been avoided for decades.<br/>What is happening in the &quot;business model&quot; of these &quot;digital marketing&quot; corporations is theft of private property, or at least of copyrighted material, that is thereafter sold to the highest bidder, literally.<br/><br/>This means that if things where ethical you(and everyone world over) should be getting payed to use google search or facebook, these companies have 0 inherent value in them, and they are not selling a product, they sell you and your baby pictures, your writings and thought, all of that in a bundle.<br/>The current setup isn&#39;t honest capitalism, it&#39;s just crocked corruption that stems from lack of oversight.<br/><br/>Likewise any content created from the appropriately licensed content, with the generative models, should be subject to further payments to license holders.<br/>so ai models can collect royalties from such generated works, so long as the bulk of these royalties is given back to the original works creators that the model is based on.<br/><br/>If you(with congress) apply all of these reforms to LLMs, Search Engines and Social Networks(or any such solution or method that resembles the bulk data collection and post processing operation), with the above approach, the US will have a thriving economic relationship with this, and future ecosystems that will arise, and the country will re-assume a leadership position in this space, specially when it comes to rule of law, and protection of it&#39;s citizens.
