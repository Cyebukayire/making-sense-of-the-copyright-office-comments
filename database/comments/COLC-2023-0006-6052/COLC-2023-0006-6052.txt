The use of generative Artificial Intelligence should be considered as copyright infringement and should never intentionally be used for commercial purposes, or amongst professional businesses. The ability to copyright works made using generative AI should not be allowed, due to the fact that the information fed to these programs are scraped from other already copyrighted material. <br/><br/>Generative AI has been used maliciously and irresponsibly across all platforms; in the form of everything from artistic theft, to deepfake pornographic material using the facial recognition of unknowing human victims. The use of generative AI should be banned immediately, and indefinitely. Thank you.
