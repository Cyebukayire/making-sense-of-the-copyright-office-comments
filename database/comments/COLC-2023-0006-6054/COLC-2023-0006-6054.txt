The concept of generated AI art and copyright of such art goes against the very foundation of copyright law in the US. The concept of Copyright points to the concept that artists, through honing their art are influenced by society. When artists create new art, it is based on our societal influences. HOWEVER the use of an algorithm means those who have no understanding or influence by creative art will be able to create an amalgamation of various artworks without any influence on the artwork itself. GAi should very well be a useful tool for an artist, but should never grant someone copyright rights on what GAi creates. GAi is a tool. <br/>Furthermore, anyone who has a right to copyright their own works under copyright laws before Generative AI, should be able to CHOOSE to opt in on their works being used for such tools, and not have their works be used as a part of machine learning unless they choose to include their works. The requirement of artists to retroactively protect their own works that was previously understood as protected under copyright law effectively makes copyright law obsolete. Please protect artist&#39;s intellectual property, and regulate the use of AI against scraping artwork that would otherwise be protected. Machine learning is not the same as an artist honing thier craft.
