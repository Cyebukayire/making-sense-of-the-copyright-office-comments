Copyright is meant to protect works of originality created by humans. This does not necessarily preclude protections for works created by humans with technological aids such as iPads, Word Processors, and other such examples. However, AI-generated works as they are currently produced rely on the original works of others in order to create something &quot;new.&quot; While it could be argued that humans operate in the same way--taking things that they have learned and turning them into new original works--AI-generated art lacks the same amount of human input as human-generated works. An individual who uses an AI (not that that is an accurate term for the computer program currently in question) to generate a work (whether literary, musical, or visual media) is relying more on the abilities of the AI than on their own learned experiences. They feed a kernel of an idea to an AI generator and the AI uses what *it* has learned to create something. If copyright is going to be applied to AI generated works then the copyright should, following traditional practices, belong to the AI. <br/><br/>As an example: a human prompts an AI to write a short story based on a brief description. The AI generates the story using the minimal input from the human. The human did not create that work: the AI did. For comparison, it would be like saying that a person describing a suspect to a sketch artist was the actual creator of the work, even though the artist was the one who put pen to paper. One could argue that the resulting work is a &quot;work made for hire,&quot; in that the AI was &quot;hired&quot; by a human to create a work, but that enters an entirely new area of legality that puts into question what compensation the AI received for its work. <br/><br/>Honestly, this is going off on a bonker balls tangent but: if artificial intelligence is going to wind up as what has been represented in science fiction works, in that they are sentient intelligent beings, the way it is currently being handled is similar to exploitation or, in a far darker vein, enslavement. An &quot;intelligent&quot; being is made to produce something that will benefit whoever is giving the AI orders, while the AI receives nothing in exchange. It is a means to an end. Even if someone pays the owner/creator of the AI for the AI&#39;s services, that still bypasses the AI. Frankly, this paragraph has more to do with AI rights than copyright, but I think it could be worth considering when it comes to how to treat AI-generated works. The wielder of a digital pen is still doing the creating when it comes to drawing on a tablet, but the &quot;wielder&quot; of an AI-generator doesn&#39;t put in nearly the same amount of effort. <br/><br/>I&#39;m losing the thread of my argument and getting far too philosophical. <br/><br/>To sum up: an AI generator is a far more advanced tool than any other technological aid hitherto employed. It requires less input than other technology to create a work, and ultimately does not represent true originality from a human. An AI is trained on works created by humans, and then uses that data to create something for a different human. Like a much more advanced version of photoshop, in terms of visual works, or advanced predictive text in terms of literary works. A human who utilizes an AI generator to output a work is not entitled to the same level of copyright as someone who does the entirety of the work themselves.
