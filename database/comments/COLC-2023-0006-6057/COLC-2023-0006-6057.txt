AI art has been trained on the styles of artists who in the vast majority of cases have not consented for their art to be used in such a way that makes an AI tool likely to copy their style and subjects. While from a macro-level perspective this may seem inconsequential, businesses and corporations have the advantage of lawyers able to intercede on their behalf in the event of a breach in intellectual property. Most common artists do not have such resources. <br/><br/>While art has been what I&#39;ve been exposed to most, the rapid expansion into other art forms such as music and writing, as well as manuscript writing in the entertainment industry leaves me to the impression that effort poached for manipulation is the theft of intellectual property for the sake of profiteering. It&#39;s already illegal to re-paint and re-sell a stolen car, this feels like a similar issue.<br/><br/>What we&#39;re seeing with the current writer&#39;s strikes also illustrates that the companies who seem most keen on using these tools are willing to use them to hurt the lives of people who would otherwise want to act as professionals in their respective fields. I cannot trust such companies and individuals with the ability to abuse copyright while stealing all they can to feed it; as it presents a danger to our ability as individuals to express ourselves and could allow companies to literally monopolize creative output.
