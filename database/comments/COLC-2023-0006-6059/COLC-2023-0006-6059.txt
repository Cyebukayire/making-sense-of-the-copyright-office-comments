Harvesting generative AI is concerning as it takes without permission from the owner and without compensation to train models to produce cheap variations of the owner&#39;s work. This includes art, pictures, music, and even voices. The problem with generative AI is that owners don&#39;t have protection measures against people stealing their work. It&#39;s hard enough to make a living but having people&#39;s work taken without permission only to be used against you in a competing market is outrageous and unethical. In addition, generative AI also has several problems that bring alarming concerns, for example, training images of someone&#39;s face to spread misinformation that can damage a person&#39;s reputation. I believe AI can be used in a safe way which can help creative explore new avenues that can further improve the creative process but currently, people&#39;s work is being stolen. AI currently is just theft plain and simple.
