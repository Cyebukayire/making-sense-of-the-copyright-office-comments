Artificial intelligence should be regulated. It should not be used to replace actors, artists, and singers which is what big corporations are trying to do in order to &ldquo;save money&rdquo; Ai art work steals from already made artwork, and turns it into something with no soul or creativity behind it. It&rsquo;s basically stealing. Not only is Ai being used to steal, but it&rsquo;s being used to make inappropriate videos of women and fake revenge pornography. Why is something like that allowed? It&rsquo;s dangerous, and needs to be regulated. With no regulations, it can put lots of people out of work or in harms way. Ai should not be copyrighted, as its not created by a single entity.
