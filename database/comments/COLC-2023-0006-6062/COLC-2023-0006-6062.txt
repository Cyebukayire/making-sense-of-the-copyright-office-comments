Intellectual property and copyright are being eroded by liberal internet platform TOS, requiring creatives to risk violation of their inherent intellectual property rights in order to post self promotional and social creations online.  AI takes it one step further and makes claim that the internet should be free for all to manipulate and resell as needed. Basic copyright DOES NOT allow for editing or redistribution of intellectual property that hasn&rsquo;t been explicitly transferred to a non-creator &mdash; usually in a paid contract. <br/>Those who work in the print industry know that you cannot simply put a google image in a newspaper. Why? Because you don&rsquo;t own the rights. You can get sued for redistributing a photo you don&rsquo;t have copyright to.  Students, published professionals, anyone who writes in scholarly journals understands the concept of plagiarism. <br/>And yet as soon as AI businesses started liberally reusing artwork, photos, and writing, the narrative is that content must be &ldquo;opted out&rdquo; of their training and refinement data sets. No &mdash; anyone who hasn&rsquo;t explicitly transferred copyright to another party is already opted out in the first place. They were NEVER OPTED IN. And they can only be opted in if they so choose. This is the only way to uphold IP/Copyright integrity.  No one who hasn&rsquo;t received explicit transfer of copyright has legal right to use content they didn&rsquo;t create. Why is this even an argument? Why has intellectual property and copyright fallen by the wayside when it means individuals would need to be consulted and if complying, compensated en masse for the legal acquisition of copyright to use their work as training and refinement data? <br/><br/>Technology should improve the lives of individuals, not put more money in the pockets of the ultrarich by sacrificing human craft and livelihoods and eroding intellectual property and copyright laws when it&rsquo;s convenient. Technology for the sake of profit isn&rsquo;t advancement, it&rsquo;s degradation. Allowing AI to disregard copyright laws is only further opening the doors to allow people and businesses with more money and influence to steal from the vulnerable with zero consequences. The future we face as it stands today looks like a dystopian nightmare.
