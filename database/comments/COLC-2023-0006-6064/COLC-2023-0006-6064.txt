Some personal background: I have a degree in computer science where my studies included history and current implementations of artificial intelligence, and have worked professionally as a software engineer for 9 years. No generative artificial intelligence was used as part of this comment.<br/><br/>The fundamental problem with Artificial Intelligence, at least in its current form (which is how it will be for the foreseeable future), is that it can only work with data, content, and situations it has seen and been trained on. As such it would be much more accurate to call them non-linear statistical regression models.<br/><br/>In short, they do not create. They only generate data that looks like some combination of what is in its dataset. More worryingly, the media, text, and other content in these datasets was often used without knowledge or any express written consent of the creators and original copyright holders of those works. They have even been found to contain sensitive personal data including medical pictures. These non-transformative derivations of these creators works are unlicensed and arguably themselves in violation of the creators copyrights to their works. We must not give machine-generated content the luxury of copyright, especially when it is stolen from existing copyrighted works.<br/><br/>A final closing note: a core part of the human experience is the act of creation or art, of taking some part of your soul and baring it for the world to see. This is not something we should try to automate and relegate to the realm of machines. Instead, we should embrace human creation for the blessing and joy that we are so lucky to have every day by affording us who create the ability to do so without fear of our work being co-opted and outright stolen.<br/><br/>Do not allow machine-generated works to be copyrighted, and enforce stricter rules on generative datasets that use stolen and unlicensed works.
