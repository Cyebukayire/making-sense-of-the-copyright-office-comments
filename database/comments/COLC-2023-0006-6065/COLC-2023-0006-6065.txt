Generative AI cannot morally or legally be trained on work not specifically and actively designated for that purpose by the creator or copyright holder. Use of others work in such way is in violation of the owners and creators rights, and copyright laws which are there to protect the moral rights of artists &amp; photographers. Widespread unauthorised use of others work in such ways undermines creative endeavour on the whole as the works are being stolen, digitally remixed and used without permission or compensation.<br/><br/>Furthermore any permission for use in generative AI models must be conscious and active, not buried in little known, hidden and complex opt-out forms as some online platforms are already doing. Consent for use needs to be active and aware permission.
