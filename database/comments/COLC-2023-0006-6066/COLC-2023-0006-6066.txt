Generative AI poses a great danger to many jobs, creative copyright, and the rise of false information. It needs to be regulated to protect millions of jobs in the artistic industries ranging from fine arts, to music, graphic design, photography, etc. It also has been shown to be used to spread blatantly false information that can hurt people.<br/><br/>Starting with how it impacts jobs in the creative fields. It&#39;s already being seen that big companies have been seen using generative AI to avoid hiring people, and posting up jobs for it during the writers and actor strike. Disney recently posted up job offerings with the promise of incredibly high salaries, above that of what normal artists would be paid. All why they refuse to go to the table with unions. Actors have had their faces and bodies scanned so that the movie companies can put them in the background instead of hiring them agaib. CGI artists are currently trying to unionize to prevent them from similar AI issues, as well as other bad business practices in the movie industry.<br/><br/>Next how it affects copyright. Currently many AI companies like Midjourney, and we are even seeing it with Adobe&#39;s AI tools, are making profit off of stealing and scraping billions of copyrighted images from artists and owned photography. Even touting prompts that include a prompt followed by &quot;in the style of *artist name*&quot;. Greg Rutkowski is a great example and has continually spoken out against it. They have not given consent, we&#39;re never asked, and haven&#39;t been paid. Adobe&#39;s AI tool has even recently shown to use certain artists names despite those same people using Adobe&#39;s &quot;opt out&quot; feature. Which I might add is not default and is buried, practically hidden, in settings. Similar things are happening in the music industry where artists vocals are being used, same in voice acting and just famous people.<br/><br/>Which leads into the next point of the spread of misinformation. While a lot of the use of AI voice has been used for memes, some are quite insidious. There was a fake press conference of Joe Biden saying the US was going to war in Ukraine. It was false, it was AI. The worst part is it doesn&#39;t seem to matter how poorly these are made, it still has been fooling people. If people have to train their eyes for the tiniest of things to look out for just to tell if something is fake or not; then it&#39;s absolutely a very dangerous risk for public safety and the spread of misinformation. The worst part is, if AI goes unchecked it will only get harder and harder to tell.<br/><br/>In summary, Generative AI needs to be heavily regulated. Unable to be copyrighted. As well as the companies and individuals who use it, to be held accountable for theft of copyright materials and profiting off of it. As well as being held accountable for fabricated information used for any purposes. Be it propaganda or sewing chaos. But most importantly the jobs, livelihood, and creative skills of the millions of artists out there need to be protected!
