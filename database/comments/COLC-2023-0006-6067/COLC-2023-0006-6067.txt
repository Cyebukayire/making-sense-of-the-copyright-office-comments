Myself and other hard working American graphic designers have been put out of and rejected from jobs at all levels because of AI artwork. For many large companies, it is easier to pay a robot to do the work instantly that would take a paid graphic designer longer to do. Art made by humans does not experience the same errors as AI &ldquo;art&rdquo;, nor does it run the risk of using copyrighted images in image generation. It is very disappointing and upsetting to see that AI generated &ldquo;art&rdquo; is being pushed to be copyrighted when the AI itself is being trained on copyrighted art, or from art from unsuspecting artists. Adobe has had a large problem with this and does not notify artists- whose work is often copyrighted- if their work has been trained on by their Adobe AI. Artists have had to search for theirselves on the Adobe Stock website to see if their work has been plagiarized. There is no easy solution to AI image generation other than ensuring that AI cannot be copyrighted while it is trained on unspecified quantities of previously copyrighted work and from unwilling artists, while putting hard working visual artists and designers out of jobs.
