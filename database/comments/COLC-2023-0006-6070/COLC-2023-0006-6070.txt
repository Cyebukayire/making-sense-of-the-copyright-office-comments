I believe that allowing the use of AI is extremely unethical. AI is only possible through the use of stealing work from the original authors and is therefore plagiarism. Plagiarism is illegal and punishable by law, therefore AI should not be permitted. The usage of AI to generate art and claim it as one&rsquo;s own is copyright infringement due to the fact that these images cannot be generated without the use of art that others have already created.<br/><br/>A concerning amount of students ranging from Middle school to University have also begun using AI generators to create and write their essay assignments for them. This is not only plagiarism, but a detriment to their education as well. <br/><br/>AI tools have also been used to create pornographic material of real people without their consent; it is referred to as &ldquo;deep fake&rdquo;. In the same vein, it is possible to use AI to create videos that never actually occurred. This has lead to the rampant spreading of misinformation, and will only get worse in the future if left unchecked.
