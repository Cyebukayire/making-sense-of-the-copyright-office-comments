I 3d scan and shoot mocap to film tv and video games for the past 20 years including 9 years at EA and 4.5 at ubisoft ther rest with IATSE local 891 in the film industry.   AI is a tool in the hand of a average person, a superpower in the hands of the artist / technician.   It wont take away jobs, it will make artist and techs super artists, and super techs, and we will be able to create more immersive worlds. this is not a cost cutting measure. Its a welcome technological hand up with the mountain of work it is to create these immersive worlds.   <br/><br/>AI requires new content to get better, new original content.   For the 3d scans that I work on and the worlds that I build, with new cameras with new sensors comes better data. AI needs this new data and will for the foreseeable future.   This is not magic , just machine&#39;s learning.  T me AI is a Grad student I pay to research, or cite papers. or write summaries to I can digest information faster.   the game logo i have linked is a game currently building with entirely AI art.   I paid for all these images from stability.ai, why cant i use them and copyright my game 1858.gold and teach / play some lessons form the 1858 gold rush in western Canada.   what is the harm in using AI and getting a copyright on my game with images and storylines I dreamt up with AI? <br/><br/>Go after criminals not the people providing the overworked, underpaid with better tools to do their jobs.
