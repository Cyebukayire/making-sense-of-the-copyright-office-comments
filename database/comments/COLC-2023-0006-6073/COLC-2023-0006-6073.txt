I am a illustrator and graphic designer. I am an artist and I work hard to create my art for company&#39;s and individuals. The idea that a computer can scrap styles and ideas from my artwork and designs worries me. My livelihood is at stake. I do not think ai artwork should be copyright protected . Art is a human exercise. What a computer does is ,in a word, soulless. Please do not allow ai to dehumanizing what we as a species do to express ourselves.
