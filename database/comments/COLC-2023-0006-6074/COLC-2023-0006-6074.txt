Artwork generated by AI can only be generated: after a person develops the code for the AI, then trains the AI with images of existing artwork.<br/><br/>Therefore, Copyright over artwork generated by AI, should only be granted to the claimant if: The claimant owns the copyright of all artwork used to train the AI, as well as the code of the AI itself. The artwork used to train, and the code of the AI, may both be under Creative Commons, or free use. However, the claimant must be able to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they either own both the artwork and code used by the AI, or that the artwork and code used by the AI are all under Creative Commons, or free use. <br/><br/>There is no circumstance where the claimant should have Copyright over AI generated artwork, simply because they entered the prompt. This can too easily be abused. A single person can use a code to run limitless prompts through an AI art generator, and claim Copyright over all prompts. Multiple people could also use the same prompt coincidentally, leading to unending conflict over who is the true owner.<br/><br/>This is all without mentioning the immense damage this causes to artists, whose artwork could be used to train AI without their knowledge or consent. This is a blatant Copyright Infringement, and in no way should someone else be able to claim Copyright over an artwork generated by an AI, using someone else&#39;s hand-created artwork, when the original artist did not consent to their Copyright Materials being used in such a way. <br/><br/>Regulations must be put in place so that in the event of a person claiming Copyright over AI generated artwork, the artwork and code used by the AI can be traced, as to confirm the Claimant has true ownership over all materials involved, or all materials are under free use, and not used without the knowledge or consent of the original artist, or coder.
