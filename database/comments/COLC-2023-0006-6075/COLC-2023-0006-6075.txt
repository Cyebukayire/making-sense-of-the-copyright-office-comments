I am a public researcher with copyrighted articles published in peer reviewed journals and on websites, open access and behind pay walls. Like many other researchers, my work has been undoubtedly AI companies have scraped my work and plagiarized it by failing to cite or ask permission to use my work. These unethical acts have extreme implications for the livelihoods of myself and others. Additionally, AI companies create dangerous situations as their technology lacks the sophistication and understanding to assess through bad quality data or data that is based in extreme, nonscientific ideologies. The consequences include the vast dissemination of misinformation at best and disinformation at worst. AI companies, whose sole purpose is to make money for a small group of shareholders, cannot be allowed to steal others work and perpetuate misinformation.
