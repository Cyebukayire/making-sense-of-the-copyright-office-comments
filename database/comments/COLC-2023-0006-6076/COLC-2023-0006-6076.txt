While a fraught subject, Copyright was originally seems intended to protect an inventor, innovator, or entrepreneur from a larger/louder body/business &quot;thieving&quot; an idea and passing it off as their own, either explicitly or implied. While still a subject of debate, I consider that there should be a more open ended form of &quot;acknowledgement&quot; available to innovators and creators. &quot;Proof of origin&quot; is what copyright endeavors to honor, but many ideas and technologies could benefit multiple sectors immediately through adjacencies that aren&#39;t readily visible due to informational restriction. Should there be such constricting stipulations on intellectual capability when we live in such an informationally savvy age? Obviously &quot;yes&quot; AND &quot;no,&quot; but the latter offers growth and potential that would stymie current efforts at gatekeeping and monopolies of technology. But how does one encourage innovation and not blatant theft? A requirement to list all utilized resources, lest investigation find a lapse and result in a fine, typically payable to the owner of origin. This, hypothetically, helps transparency and should result in elevating one who is willing to try to solve such problems. And those trying to avoid being &quot;stiffed&quot; end up clinging to their patents with vice-like intensity. It&#39;s also a shame when someone who had come to an idea through rigor and research is overshadowed by an algorithm (or stolen in secret?) and the owner of the patent has no recourse at all. This seems unnecessarily predatory in this day and age of innovation. Both for the innovators AND the businesses alike.<br/>I propose a new direction.<br/><br/>This could be brought to reality with a 10% flat tax (when over $50k a year) on &quot;net profits&quot; from (not just) A.I. and those who hold the &quot;proof of origin&quot; are given a portion of that 10% based on the intellectual contribution to the process. If it was purely a blueprint and the manufacturing technique is purely novel for this business, then in-essence the entirety of that 10% goes to the creator of the blueprint. If the *process* and blueprint are both utilized from other sources, then that 10% is split between both equally. It then encourages business to be capable of change to utilize the &quot;relevant adjacent&quot; ideas that could also help the innovators see returns on their ideas, year over year instead of &quot;buyouts&quot; at laughable portions of the potential profits generated, while also not dooming businesses to fail when a proprietary recipe (that was paid a mint for) equates to &quot;try turning it upside down.&quot;<br/><br/>You can see how this might both encourage innovation *and* integration of new ideas and techniques. Consider also, that it handles instances of &quot;tree branching innovation.&quot; To use a generalized and simplified example. If someone generates an algorithm/AI that ORIGINALLY sees little use but results in several new systems/models who use it to build their prospects from scratch, and then one of *those* prospects is taken on by a large company which sees $100k net profits one year... Not only does the prospect see $10k (prior to a 10% take) the creator of the first software that generated that prospect is granted $1k too, despite the measures of separation.<br/><br/>A.I. is uniquely capable of this through digital &quot;watermarking&quot; that can (using blockchains) possibly even &quot;automate&quot; this proper distribution of &quot;intellectual property usage.&quot; It also encourages people to come forward with ideas quickly and readily in an effort to be &quot;first&quot; to innovate a concept/patent/technique and receive &quot;proof of origin&quot; benefits. I&#39;d discourage these being able to be &quot;sold&quot; as to discourage &quot;agglomeration&quot; of patents by corporate entities, perhaps even requiring that each be &quot;held&quot; by an individual for accountability(did the person even pursue claims of origin in this matter?) and clarity of ownership in the event of dissolution. Difficulty arise (as usual) from those attempting to &quot;game the system&quot; by having &quot;proof of origin&quot; on... well... everything. But this also coincides with the need for &quot;the burden of proof&quot; to fall on the individual. <br/><br/>Right now, data *privacy* and transparency seems a more pressing matter than copyright explicitly, though certainly important in its&#39; own ways. The methods exist in technology today, we need only utilize them effectively which will inevitably mean independent verification and surveillance... Similar to what happens with nowadays with patent lawyers already to verify voracity. I think A.I. should be allowed room to grow being still in it&#39;s infancy. Ideally in a way that A.I. itself (and those developing it) would have little to no reason to alter or &quot;falsify&quot; their origins for itself or others. Regulate heavily, and the tools for obfuscation strengthen. Regulate too lightly, and abuses run rampant... I feel this strikes an effective middle ground that sets a healthy precedent for moving forward, while also acknowledging the transient and ephemeral nature of AI. I welcome dialogue on the subject.
