AI created works cannot be legally protected by copyright.<br/><br/>AI does not create original works. It functions by scraping the internet for content and essentially running that content through a blender to spit out a &#39;new&#39; piece. The &#39;new&#39; piece will contain parts of works from hundreds, thousands, even millions of artists and writers who did not consent to have their work used in these datasets, some pieces that were &#39;made&#39; by AI so clearly copies that they will even contain the watermarks of the artists they have stolen from. To allow these products to be protected by copyright would be a spit in the face to every artist and writer who has been robbed to produce them, who often cannot get real protection for their own works and who did not consent to having their work stolen, torn apart and copied. AI work is not original, it is not new, it is not unique. It is the works of others run through a blender, without human translation or creativity or any other human filter to shape it into something new and original such as taking inspiration from other works - and spat out. It will destroy the industries of creative writing and art. So many artists and writers have already stopped producing work because of it, and AI has even begun to self-cannibalize, producing work that is more and more incoherent as it feeds off itself as people stop producing works for it to steal. This is not a future anyone wants or needs besides the tech bros who think the arts are beneath them. Art should not be created by code, by a machine chopping things up and spitting them out glued together in a slightly different way. Real art is a creation of human emotion and expression, something a computer cannot do. We can make them imitate it if we write the code correctly, but it is not the same. To copyright protect works created by theft is like arresting someone who bought a stolen TV, but not the person who stole the TV in the first place, or providing compensation to the person who was robbed. The victims of the original theft are the ones who will suffer the most, over and over, and eventually no one will bother creating anything new, because a computer can do it. Not better, not even as well, but faster - and speed seems to be all that the people who want AI to be used in entertainment care about, not the quality of the entertainment. <br/><br/>Please do not reward thieves and crooks for stealing from those of us who pour our hearts and souls into our work. AI isn&#39;t just unethical, it&#39;s also dangerous - just look at the &#39;foraging guides&#39; showing up on Amazon with fake authors, written by AI and full of the kind of misinformation that will get people killed. This has to stop.
