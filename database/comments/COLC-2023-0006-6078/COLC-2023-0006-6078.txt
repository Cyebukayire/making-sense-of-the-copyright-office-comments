GenerativeAI in its current form is an ethical nightmare. It functions completely on theft of IP and relies on an Ask Forgiveness not permission policy. Only in a most corrupt world could the theft of millions of other peoples art and writings to create a multi billion dollar for profit industry, with the intention of destroying the lives of those they have stolen from, be considered fair and legal.<br/><br/>Current laws have not accounted for the rise of this technology and must be updated to protect the actual creators who have become the unwitting backbone of this predatory software. The tech industry knows the laws haven&rsquo;t accounted for it and are flooding the market in an attempt to become to big to fail.<br/><br/>This is nothing short of the most unethical use of technology in many decades.
