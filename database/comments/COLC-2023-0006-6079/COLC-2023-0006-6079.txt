I really think that AI work shouldn&rsquo;t be able to have a copyright put on it. First of all, the person who used the AI to generate a work did next to nothing and shouldn&rsquo;t get credit for something that would independently take a human being hours. Second, a court of law in 2016 decided copyrights could not be made on a piece of work not made by a human. By all definitions, an AI isn&rsquo;t a human, and therefore the law should still apply. Third, giving AI work a copyright could put millions of artists out of a job, so unless you hate people being happy, don&rsquo;t do it.
