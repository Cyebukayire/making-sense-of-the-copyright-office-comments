Given that AI-produced works are 100% derivative by their nature of other peoples work, no, it should not be copyrightable. It&#39;s a fun gag, a curiosity, entertainment to see what a computer &quot;sees&quot; and &quot;understands&quot;, but that is the limit of its value in the arts. To legitimize AI work through copyright is to legitimize willful plagiarism and encourage those who would always choose to cut corners and cut jobs to do so, and force those who normally would not to use AI to remain competitive. Refusing to copyright AI work means protecting the livelihoods of the artisans and skilled workers AI relies on to make anything at all.
