I personally detest the usage of AI generated work, AI models have already taken away jobs and opportunities for working people in voice acting and artistry. AI lacks creativity and an actual thought process, it will steal enjoyable work for millions while producing products that don&#39;t have any human element to them. AI needs to be restrained or else businesses and entire industries will collapse to the ground.
