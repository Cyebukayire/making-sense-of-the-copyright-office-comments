AI image generation in its current form only harms creatives in their field. It was initially used to scrape data and be used for image generation without the permission of any of the artists who created the artworks in question, and with zero compensation, and we are now seeing creatives (book illustrators, voice actors, writers and so on) actively losing work because of this highly unethical practice. They show no sign of slowing down and human beings are already losing their livelihoods as a result. If we have any compassion or care for the work that creatives provide, or even empathy as people, we cannot permit companies steal the labors of their love, creativity, and talent to turn a quick profit.
