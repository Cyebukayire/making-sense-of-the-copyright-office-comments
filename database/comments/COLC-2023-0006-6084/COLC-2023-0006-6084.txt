As an artist, working professionally and seeing that these AI companies have not only blatantly stolen their art to feed their algorithm but also for the express purpose of making money off of stolen work and making it harder for workers to actually find jobs in a PLETHORA of fields, AI needs to be regulated to the utmost. We cannot allow corporations or the highest bidder to continue to monetize stolen work and continue to make it harder and harder for the common worker to earn a living. We are literally talking about hundreds of thousands of people that earn a living in this field having their work used against them for zero compensation. These corporations know this and are lobbying hard to try and make it so that they can profit off of this stolen work without actually having a human do anything. Typing a prompt is no more than having a search engine look for an image. To then say &quot;this is mine&quot; is laughable and completely destroys the hard work of everyday people. We already have a huge crisis in this country when it comes to wealth inequality and this is just going to make it that much worse. Please do the right thing and know that this is NOT actually original work in any way. It is stolen. To try and turn a profit over stolen work and even worse, allow a COPYRIGHT on stolen work or a PROMPT will cause irreparable harm to society and to art in all it&#39;s forms. This is purely a money grab from thieves and charlatans trying to sell the latest in snake oil as their own.
