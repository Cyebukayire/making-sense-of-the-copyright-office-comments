Air and generative content is problematic in its current iteration. In principal the idea of it is not bad and having worked professionally along side those who have used it, there are use cases for it within the industry. Unfortunately it has been co-oped by those looking to monetize low effort production as a cash grab and for use in bad faith, such as explicitly trying to mimic an artist style against their consent using their work as training data or create derivative works based in intellectual property.<br/>The data sets themselves are problematic as they have ballooned out to scraping content without consent and appropriate image assets whole sale, example can be seen where Ai tries to even include artist signatures and watermarks.<br/>Another factor is liability as these data sets have been developed with research and testing in mind but again have been taken and used for commercial products, again with no consent to the original artists. They have used this loophole to claim fair use despite selling the tools to plagiarise with it. The only course of action at this point in to rebuild said data sets with opt in assets and hold these companies to account for the stolen generative data.
