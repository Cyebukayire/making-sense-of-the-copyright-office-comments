Copyright online has already been decimated for authors and other creatives by the joke in bad taste referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which puts upon the individual creative the onus of enforcing copyright on the entire internet. No meaningful consequences attach for violating copyright online, and now AI--which has egregiously violated copyright in its very formative stage--is set to trash what little incentive is left to create at all. Every work &quot;generated&quot; by AI is derivative. by its very nature. To copyright the results of copyright violation is an even worse step in the wrong direction than allowing big tech to govern the internet like the mafia it is. Please for the love of storybooks and lovely art, do not hand an enormous reward to big tech for having broken all the rules and paid no consequences. Wrong, wrong, wrong.
