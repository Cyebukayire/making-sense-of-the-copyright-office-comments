The use of AImuddies current copyright laws by directly using images and art and other such pieces of creative work that have not been approved for such uses by the original creator. While art creation takes inspiration from other artwork, the way in which AI scrapes composition, color, pose, and style from creative work is more closely like blatant plagiarism and copying than wholly new works. Alongside this, current AI&#39;s have no sense of understanding of their own work and process. Creative activities hinge on the intentionality and self-awareness of the creative agent that AI does not currently emulate. While a human actor may try to add their own will onto an AI, the individual fundamentally does not control the actual creation process, but is more similar to a client to a freelance artist, critiquing work and asking for tweaks rather than being the creative agent themselves. The current lack of regulation of generative AI could lead to further problems of individuals finding people trying to copy and emulate their own artwork as a means of sidestepping the creative agent and potentially taking away future job prospects. Therefore, I believe that the use of generative AI should be heavily regulated or completely disallowed.
