I feel that the use of AI in art, be it in visual mediums or in written form, creates the idea that anyone can be an artist -- even if it is by piggybacking off someone else&#39;s work. In academia, we call the use of someone else&#39;s work without permission &#39;plagiarism.&#39; It should not be allowed to be used in creative works that generate text or imagery with the intent to sell. As a writer myself, I feel that the idea of AI is great for science and medicine, and technology as a whole. However, as a creative medium, and with no way to realistically &#39;source&#39; where the information that the generated content is coming from, it creates the problem of crediting the original source creator. Who is to say that a poor artist who has his work mined by AI technology won&#39;t create someone else&#39;s fortune? THAT, I feel, is why AI is so disrespectful, and why I feel it should not be allowed to be copyrighted.
