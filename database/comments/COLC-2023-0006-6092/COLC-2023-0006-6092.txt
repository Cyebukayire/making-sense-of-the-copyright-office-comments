The law for AI should be different from what we have for humans. Much like guns humans can own a gun but robat can&#39;t. It&#39;s been very deceiving that they say it was a public art so we used it to train our machine but when something is publicly available it dosennt mean it&#39;s for public use. My car is parked in a public area it doesn&#39;t mean someone can use it to train his family that&#39;s stealing. It&#39;s easy and simple because they could download our artwork it dosent mean they could use it in massive scale. That&#39;s why illegal coppy of movies called piracy! Or the AI companies argue we just download it to use it once and our machine keeps use it for ever! But we didn&#39;t know how much money we could make se we didn&#39;t pay for it! I think the AI companies CEOs should be charged with art piracy in a massive scale. It&#39;s not different than using one artist copyrighted art and just download it to AI machines and hoping it&#39;s different! US rightfully blaming China for stealing and copying our patents and data. Now exact same things in bigger scale is happening in US but AI corporations are stealing from artists while they know it&#39;s inherently illegal. I think the AI companies shouldn&#39;t be above the law no matter how much money they spend to change the Narratives.
