The allure of being able to create, when one is not a skilled creator, has proven to be an irresistible and addictive concept. Except it no longer is a concept, it is our new reality. When it&#39;s easier to not ask permission, many won&#39;t. We need regulation on using copyright work in AI and it is already too late to stop many AI programs from what copyright work they&#39;ve already taken. It would be easier to now also deny AI art the ability to be copyrighted, if not just as an extra safety measure against abuse of stealing but also to reduce incentive to steal if denied profit. The very bottom line of this matter is AI artwork should never be monetizable and held in the same copyright standard as human-made art.
