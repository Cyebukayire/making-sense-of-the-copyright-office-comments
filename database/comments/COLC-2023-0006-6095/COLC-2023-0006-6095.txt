As an artist myself, I believe AI can have a place in art, as a tool, the same way a brush is a tool, but currently it is not used this way. A brush still needs the person using the brush to have the skills and training to produce. AI takes a written prompt and produces, a lot like asking someone else to do it. But in this case it&rsquo;s NOT someone else doing it, it&rsquo;s not a living being, it cannot produce anything without first inputting data to train the machine. In the case of AI generated images this data is often taken from different sources on the internet, then stored for the use of training AI without the consent of the creator of the images used for training said AI. Copyright is completely ignored by almost everyone training these AIs, the wishes of the creators of the work used is ignored because of outdated laws that were not made with the existence of AI in mind.<br/><br/>New copyright laws need to be made in the favor of the artists who&#39;s work is being used without their approval, never in the favor of machines, they may be called &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t be fooled by the name for there is no intelligence there, not in the same sense as anything living.
