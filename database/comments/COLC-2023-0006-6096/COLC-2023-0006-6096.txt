As an artist, and as someone who has looked into how these AI models (Text, Image and audio) work, it is clear to me that almost all the publicly available models are based on writing, art, photographs, voice acting, and music that was taken without explicit permission from the original creators, and thusly should be considered plagiarism and in some cases, copyright infringement. It should be noted that AI models are distinctly different from a human artist taking inspiration from others work, as AI models cannot take inspiration, only remix existing forms into new shapes, and in some cases reproduce work exactly from a sample piece of data.<br/><br/>This kind of mass plagiarism is already being invested in by giant corporations for the sake of not having to pay artists, a notable case being Disney investing in AI for creative work right after the Writers Union went on strike.<br/><br/>It is also worth noting that creatives will not be the only people effected by the rise of AI technologies, there will likely be a rise in AI deepfake video and audio of famous people, putting words and actions in their mouths that they never said, without legal protection from this kind of slander serious damage could come to our political system, as misinformation floods the internet and the world at scale.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that should AI models be allowed to steal people&#39;s art and likeness without fear of legal consequences for their owners, that we will be heading for a very turbulent future.
