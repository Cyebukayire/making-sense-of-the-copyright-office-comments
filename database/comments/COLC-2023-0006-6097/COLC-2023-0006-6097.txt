While I am no expert, I can see the issues of AI loud and clear. Since AI has no human authorship - as in, no human actively made the piece but rather prompted a computer to do so - it really shouldn&#39;t be able to be copyrighted. AI doesn&#39;t work by creating out of nowhere what it makes, instead it works off of archives of stolen work and meshes them together in such a way it can make a &#39;new&#39; image. In the same way you can&#39;t copyright a Google search, you shouldn&#39;t be able to copyright an AI image or writing.
