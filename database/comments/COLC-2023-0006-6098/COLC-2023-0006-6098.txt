no. just no. AI literally steals the ideas and rights to said ideas from their original creators. using AI for any form of art whether it be books music or physical art is not at all okay and should not be allowed. it is theft no matter how you try to say it so ai should not be allowed to do it. using ai for your own ideas is fine but for others ideas it is wrong.
