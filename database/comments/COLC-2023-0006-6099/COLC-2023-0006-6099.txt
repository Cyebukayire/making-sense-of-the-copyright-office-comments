I am concerned that there is no opt-in function for generative AI (there is often no opt-out function either). I am a visual artist who posts her work online, and because of this, all of my pieces can be used to train an AI engine to generate new images in artwork. Not only does this create competition for me in the job market (with AI images based on my own work!), but it also uses my work without my consent to generate profits for 3rd party AI companies. I feel exploited, and that it is only a matter of time until artists are undercut entirely in favor of cheaper AI models.
