I am greatly concerned about the labor implications when it comes to AI. Already we have such a stark divide between workers and company owners. If we allow AI to be developed off the backs of workers and labor and then utilized to replace or severely impact the pay of the workers causing a greater divide. It&rsquo;s one thing to replace workers via technological innovation. It&rsquo;s another thing to use the work of those workers for free within the technological innovation to replace the workers without any rights protecting the people that supplied and created the data that is now fed into the technological innovation.
