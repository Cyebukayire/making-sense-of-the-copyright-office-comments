I fully support the previous decisions that work generated entirely by AI cannot be copywritten under the auspices that no human ingenuity was involved in the creation of said work. AI does not generate new and creative art - it is derivative of other (possibly already copywritten) works and should therefore not be treated as a unique work in its own right. Just as it was taught by web crawling through existing material available for free on the internet, so should any of its output be available for free use by anyone.
