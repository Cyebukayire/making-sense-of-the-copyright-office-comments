Speaking as an artist. I&#39;m of the opinion that an AI should solely be trained on content from the public domain, or content that the creator of has given express permission for it to be used in that way. <br/><br/>It&#39;s simply unethical to allow someone to scrap a website and take every drawing, word written, or photo to use in their product. Not only would copyright images and text be stolen, but also people&#39;s likenesses from their own photos. Including those of minors. <br/><br/>If the AI is allowed to only train on material that the creator has permission to use, then this problem is removed. I believe that this can allow for an ethical AI to be created.<br/><br/>As for who then owns the copyright to the image that the AI creates. We already have precedent for this in animal made artworks. If someone can not own the copyright to a painting down by an elephant, why should they be able to own the copyright to one done by a robot?
