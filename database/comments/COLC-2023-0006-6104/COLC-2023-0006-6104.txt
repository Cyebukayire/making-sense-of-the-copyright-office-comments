AI generated art can have its positive uses. It allows people who are struggling to with a concept to be able to find visual aids to help them with their work. What is not acceptable with the current iteration of it is that AI databases pull from artists who did not give their consent for their work to be used in such a manner, to the point where malicious parties are able to profit from unsuspecting victims into thinking they are purchasing genuine content when in fact they have fallen for a scam.<br/><br/>Regulations need to be put in place. Artists need to be protected. generative AI is a threat in its current form to artists who make it their living to create. Give them that power. Give them the tools they can use to protect themselves from these malicious parties.
