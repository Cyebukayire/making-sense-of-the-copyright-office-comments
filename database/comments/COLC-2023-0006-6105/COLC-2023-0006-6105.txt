I believe that generative AI negatively impact those entering the entertainment industry as well as artists, writers, voice actors and other creatives due to corporations favoring AI over human experience and skills through the use of non-consensual stolen content from the best of the best in order to bypass paying their employees. I feel that protecting creative&rsquo;s copyright is more needed than ever in times like these, as it is unfair that creatives strive to earn a living and not get compensated for their effort in developing their skills and talent, and AI may make it difficult for future creatives to find a place to practice their craft without the fear of their job being taken away.
