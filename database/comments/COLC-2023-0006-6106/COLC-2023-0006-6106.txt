Greetings,<br/><br/>Regarding the proposed inquiry of &quot;The U.S. Copyright Office is conducting a study regarding the copyright issues raised by generative artificial intelligence (AI)&quot; I would like to state my own difficulties, concerns, and obstacles.<br/><br/> - Artistic Authenticity<br/>Generative AI often reshapes and remixes content rather than producing something genuinely novel or original. This dilutes the essence of original creations. Using AI as an artistic crutch diminishes the value of human creativity and can be likened to a poorly crafted collage. True artists invest time and emotion into their work; should they be overshadowed by those using AI shortcuts? There is no other way around what it is, it is theft, immense theft at that. And it impacts more than just artists, but all creatives. Why should an Amalgam be heralded as art when it is of truth of no account? It is not only praising ineptitude and speed over care, and skill, but it effectively defiles creatives for their expression in lieu of wanting to be a cheap replica.<br/><br/>-Industry Impact<br/>Unchecked AI usage can devalue genuine art and undermine our creative industries. Originality risks becoming secondary as AI facsimiles gain prevalence. The authentic touch of artists, writers, and musicians could be eclipsed by AI renditions, eroding the foundations of our creative domains. And we as humans will lose our culture and expression due to it. <br/><br/>-Expression as a Human<br/>AI in artistry is not just a copyright issue due to its exploitative nature, but it defiles, exploits, and steals from our collective cultural heritage of expression. Without regulation, without extreme oversight, Such generated material will nullify expression. It lacks anything genuine, no cultural nuance, nor expression, it lacks soul and anything that could be seen as human. And for it to overtake our writing, art, media...I shudder to think of what this world will become in the lack of genuine expression. All for the sake of those who could not be bothered to mitigate their time towards learning such skills. This reduces human creativity to mere data points for AI manipulation. Are we just data to be exploited? Are we no longer human? <br/><br/>
