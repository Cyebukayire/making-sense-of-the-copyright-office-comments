Generative AI programs are not capable of creating copyrightable material because they are trained on stolen IP. Companies cannot be allowed to train their machine learning algorithms on copyrighted work without obtaining the right to use that work. That is a blatant violation of copyright law and a disregard for the purpose of copyright in the first place, which is to protect original work and protect creators from having their work stolen or used without credit, as well as to ensure creators are compensated for any further use of their work.
