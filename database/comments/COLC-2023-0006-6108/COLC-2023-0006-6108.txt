AI companies such as Midjorey, Dall-e, Stable Defusion, and openAI have been violating copyright laws by using our Data and works to help develop their products (their AI) by using creators&#39; intellectual property to train their machines. Also, they encourage their users to use artist names and upload artist IPs into their different models to assist in the development. AI depends on our existing works and continual labor to function correctly, and using our pieces without our consent and payment or credit is not only unethical but illegal.<br/>For example, the animated film depends on the labor and works of others to help create the final product. Those works depend on artists to develop concept work to figure out the character, the background, and the overall film; most of that work was never in the final product but was necessary for creating that film. AI is similar; it depends on existing pieces and the continual labor of others to produce the results it does. The difference is that the animated movie hires pays, and credits the artist for using their work and labor. AI does not; I am not against the technology, but using that tech to exploit others and their work, whether that is illustrators, writers, designers, and other&#39;s Intellectual property or using our personal information and data. As AI is now, those works should not be copyrightable. Companies and individuals that scrape people&#39;s work and use people&#39;s data without the consent of the original owners should be held accountable; AI should be a tool used to assist people in their individual work, not exploit it. If people train their personal AI on their intellectual property and data, I believe that it can be copyrightable because it was their work and labor used to develop it. But if the work it trains on does not belong to the original creator and is taken without consent from the original IP owner, that person should held legally liable. <br/>Thank you for hearing me out and my thoughts on this issue. I hope to contribute and continue to do so moving forward. Have a fantastic day.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>
