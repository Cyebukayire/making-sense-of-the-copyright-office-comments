After hour of research I as most people conclude that content made through the technology known as generative AI cannot be understood as more than theft. <br/><br/>It takes the hard work of thousands, and regurgitates it without much thought as the machine is incapable of doing so. It&#39;s not conscious of what has done or for what, and of course it gives no credit or compensation to the original authors of the works it process it. But more importantly it puts thousand if not even millions of those artists in danger of not only not receiving the compensation of the content produced but the loss of work and ways of making livelihood. <br/><br/>These are some but not the only reasons why copyrights can&#39;t and should not be given to the products created by this technology as we currently understand it by the U.S.A. Federal Register, and granting it would be a terrible precedent to set as what the U.S.A. DOES will be followed by many nations. Thus the protection to human creators and artists must stand and these technologies must be regulated.<br/>
