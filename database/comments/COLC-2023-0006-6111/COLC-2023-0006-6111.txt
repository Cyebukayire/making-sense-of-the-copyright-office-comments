Artists, actors, and other creators deserve like any other worker to be fully compensated for their labor. Having their works be pulled from to form the basis of another&#39;s without compensation (I haven&#39;t seen any credit given either, since much of the data has been pulled indiscriminately, though this is not the most important part of the argument) is a textbook copyright violation, and this being done through a computer program does not diminish that fact in the least. The &quot;Artificial Intelligences&quot; thus far have been reputed for taking works without permission or any consultation from the artists, actors, writers, or other creative laborers who have made the content or any organizations who have paid for the rights to these works the &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; programs are pulling from. Creators have a right to their intellectual property and the fruits of their labor, and deserve to be informed, compensated, and where relevant credited for their works.<br/>Furthermore, I have heard of the company behind Zoom planning to use data from people using their services, which in addition to copyright violations from stealing words and performances (I suppose the motions one makes during chatting with your cousin at college in another state falls under &quot;performances&quot; here...) is a massive violation of privacy, particularly when it comes to medical and mental health information (many therapists use Zoom to connect with clients virtually).
