AI models should not be allowed to use copyrighted material for commercial use without the consent of the copyright holders. The use of the copyright holders&#39; material in generations could take away from their potential market space. For example, image generation in the style of a currently working artist could take away from potential sales of their artworks. AI generated material should also not be able to be copyrighted unless there is significant human involvement (not just making slight tweaks).
