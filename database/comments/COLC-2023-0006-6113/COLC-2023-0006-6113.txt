As someone who works in the visual arts, I think that the use of AI and generative media must be regulated and must be held to the same scrutiny as other copywritten fields. AI as it currently stands, takes images and written text from already copywritten work, without permission or known consent from the original parties, and is already being exploitatively used by bad actors who see it as a cheap replacement for those same original creators. Without regulation, these original parties have no way to defend themselves and open themselves to a lot of danger of bad actors/people claiming they have made works that might not align or agree with their sensibilities, but is in their work&#39;s image. (For example, Sarah Anderson, a popular internet comic artist has previously seen harassments from Alt-Right groups editing her comics to say things she herself does not agree with. In this article, she shows an example of someone typing her name as a prompt for one of these AI generative tools, and the result is scarily similar to her finished work. A mirror that will only improve over time if left unchecked. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/opinion/sarah-andersen-how-algorithim-took-my-work.html) <br/><br/>In addition, the rampant use of AI tools will be used as cost cutting measures to cut loose many American jobs, as we have seen in the offers by AMPTP. Buying someone&#39;s likeness and only paying them for 1 day of work, while using their image in thousands and thousands of films and tv shows is unethical and anti-labor. Without regulations in place, AI puts thousands of jobs in the film industry, the video game industry, the animation industry, and countless other jobs at risk. Not just hobbyists who are not able to protect themselves but people who create and design for television, packaging for products, and so on. <br/><br/>From the jump, since AI uses work and likenesses without permission or consent, it cannot and should not be copywritten, it cannot and should not be left unchecked and it desperately needs regulation.
