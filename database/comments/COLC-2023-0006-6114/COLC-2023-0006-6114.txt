Good evening, <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to seriously review regulations on AI, and thank you in advance for reading my comment. I for one believe that serious rules on generative AI need to be established. For close to a year we have seen these systems be released to the public and the more we understand how they work the more troubling it seems. The fact that programs like MIdJourney and other AI art generators were trained off MASSIVE amounts of human-created copyrighted data, while not compensating, said artists seems very unethical. Even though those AI generators claim to be tools to help artists, in their current forms they just seem to be tools for major corporations and businesses to undermine the same artists that unwittingly helped train those systems. Courts are already coming down on the side of substantially human-made work, and I feel as if the copyright is also heading in the same direction. I would love to see workers and artists be properly protected from being exploited by the large tech companies trying to undermine the skills they have spent years cultivating, Large tech firms should not be allowed to get away with scrapping up large amounts of data to train systems that will eventually try to replace the people they scrapped the copyrighted data from. Be it generative AI like MidJourney, or AI LLMs like ChatGpt, these companies have unethically taken human-made copyrighted data, and they should be held reigned in and held accountable before they do irrefutable harm. <br/><br/>Copyrights should be awarded to the human creator/producer who puts substantial mental and physical work (75%-95%) into a peice/product, and not to the user who just enters a prompt. That same copyright should be substantially protected from being hoover up by large tech firms and companies whos intent is to take that work and feed it into a machine that is meant to be direct competition or even replace that Copyright holder. <br/><br/>Best, <br/><br/>
