I am writing to you as a practising artist as well as a secondary school art teacher in Australia. AI generated imagery has been harmful for artists, as its proliferation has devalued the work of digital artists. It will not be long for this view to extend towards every field of art as the technology improves. For AI generated imagery to function, it depends on training upon immense visual datasets. For all the images being used in those datasets none of the artists were able to indicate to opt in to this system. I find the fact that no consent was given from the artists to use their work to be very disturbing, and this has set a dangerous precedent for individuals and corporations to freely access what could be deeply personal work and an artist&#39;s cultivated style and identity for commercial gain with no credit or benefit to the original artist. <br/>As a teacher, I see my students striving to flourish in different creative fields, such as becoming an artist, graphic designer, animator or worker in the film industry, among many other jobs. I have seen that potential opportunities are diminishing as many companies are opting to use generative AI. Entry level jobs that could have been a student&#39;s first stepping stone into their desired industry are now becoming limited due to companies choosing generative AI as a cheaper alternative. With only mid to professional jobs still remaining on the market it will be extremely hard for a secondary school graduate to compete against tertiary students or professionals. I already see my students&#39; sense of hopelessness that, when they graduate with all the skills that they have, they will have to compete against generative AI for limited job opportunities in the creative field.
