AI should not have any copyright protections,  in its existence or post human editing (e.g. a human writer edits AI work) unless it can proven the AI generated content was proven to be created with the intentional consent of the work the AI has studied from (so the author fully consents to the use and has complete control over it&#39;s use).<br/><br/>AI exists unethically. It constantly steals work to exist, and the human is merely putting in inputs and prompts - there is no original creation from the human in this scenario, nor any artistic skill required. When AI work feeds more so on itself, instead of the work of others through artists using protective measure such, it is even more evident where it gets its material to create images. That is, it takes from existing work of actual artists. The &#39;opt out&#39; is a lie, as all a creators work is opted in automatically, and opting out after the creator is aware does not remove the works created from their image, and it doesn&#39;t remove the training the AI has done.<br/><br/>What is ruled will set a precedent for the world. The technology in its current existence is actively harmful. <br/><br/>AI should not have any copyright protection, unless it can be proven that the use of AI was singular to the intentionally fed work of material the human already has ownership of. That is, if I painted some portraits, and I fed those portraits into an AI that only I could then use, to create different works that I create and then work over - no one else - then perhaps there is argument for fair human authorship. Specifically, fair. If I used any one else&#39;s work to feed into the AI, that would not be fair.<br/><br/>For both commerical and non-commercial, there should not be any rights of protection. And in any commerical use, there should compensation owed to the owners of the material the AI image has taken from. <br/><br/>Please stand by the courts ruling of no protection to AI. Please.
