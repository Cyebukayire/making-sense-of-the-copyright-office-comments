I believe that due to how AI is currently used by sampling the works of others, that there should be copyright tools in place to protect the original users who have their work sampled. If someone were to use an image generator that directly mimicked an artist, then the person generating that image should not be able to profit off of the AI image, work, or other item as it was not theirs. Similarly, artists, writers, and other professions that can have their work plagiarized should been granted protections to be able to take action against people who steal their work for AI generation.
