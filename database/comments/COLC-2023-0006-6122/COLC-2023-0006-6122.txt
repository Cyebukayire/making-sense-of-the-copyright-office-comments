Artificial Intelligence is based upon a collection of data points that a computer can draw from and attempt to replicate, following patterns. AI artwork, therefore, is a generated image based upon the data points given to the AI. Anything created by an AI is based heavily upon what it has been &quot;feed&quot;, and is not original. Therefore, I firmly believe that AI artwork, text, etc, is not an original work, and is just spliced together copies of the data points given to the AI. It should not be allowed to be placed under copyright of the AI prompt giver without the express approval of all owners of the data points fed into the AI. If even one owner of a single data point given to the AI does not approve that something made from their property should be placed under copyright by another, then it should not be placed under copyright.
