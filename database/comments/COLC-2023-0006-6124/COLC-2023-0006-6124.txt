Generative AI should not be allowed to use work from artists without explicit consent. It should not be the responsibility of an artist to have to manually opt out, especially with organizations who collect data deliberately making it difficult or obtuse to deny these permissions. AI data collectors need to be the ones reaching out, not stealing first and then asking forgiveness. Doing so should be taken seriously as a violation of the rights of the artist. I&rsquo;m commenting to voice my support for individual artists, those whose work is most vulnerable to being taken by AI data collectors, who are more often large corporations that have more assets to dissuade individuals from raising more serious disputes. Protection for the artists should be at the top of the agenda.
