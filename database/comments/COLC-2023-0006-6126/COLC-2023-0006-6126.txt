I am an artist, and have experiences with statistics and machine learning models (which AI is based on). <br/><br/>There are many other arguments I could make for why AI is detrimental for copyright, artists, and art as a whole, but I think my perspective as an artist and statistician is most useful here.<br/><br/>AI models, whether it be for visual art or writing, cannot exist without millions upon billions of pieces of human-made art. Getting permission to use the sheer amount of art required to train a model is immensely impractical. Because of this, almost every generative AI model in current use COULD NOT EXIST without relying on billions of pieces of art used without the original artists&#39; permission. Even if artists&#39; consent was not a concern, it would be effectively impossible to compensate the artists&#39; for their labor and contribution to the model. The people sharing these models use this as an excuse to profit off the work of millions of artists and writers without even acknowledging that their product could not exist (much less make them money) without the contribution of those artists. <br/><br/>I have absolutely no issue with the creation and use of AI for research purposes, but commercial use is almost exclusively exploitative. <br/><br/>Even if that weren&#39;t the case, AI will cause art to stagnate. AI is not &quot;smart.&quot; It is not &quot;intelligent.&quot; It cannot create new ideas, images, or innovation. It can only reconfigure things that it has already seen human artists do.<br/><br/>This might not be a problem if it were not for the fact that AI art is much less expensive to produce than human-made art. Corporations are already replacing real, human artists and writers with AI generated content. They are removing incentive for people to create art. <br/><br/>Human beings are the only ones that can innovate. AI cannot. If the majority of art becomes AI, art as a discipline will not advance. New stories will not be told. Cliffhangers, plot twists, things you&#39;ve never seen before, will dwindle and dwindle until they effectively cease to exist. <br/><br/>AI models trained on work that was given WITH THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS&#39; PERMISSION are fine as far as I am concerned. But they should primarily be used as tools- they should not be used to replace artists, and they cannot replace the innovation and advancement that human intelligence brings.
