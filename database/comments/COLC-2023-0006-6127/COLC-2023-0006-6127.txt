Art is something created by humans for the benefit of all who experience it in whatever form. A machine does not create, it does not see to the heart of any human issue, concern, need, want etc. as such all any machine can ever do is sample (steal) existing works and regurgitate them. It is not moved by love, or passion, or insight or empathy or any deep feeling. It can only run its program. It can offer no insight, no vision, no hope, no expression that was not already expressed better by a human being. Machines, including a.i. have no place as creative entities because they are incapable of creation. They can be used to preserve, restore and share works that could otherwise be lost. But they can never be allowed to replace human artists.
