Hello.<br/><br/>I am a freelance illustrator. I do work for both public and private clients on character art. <br/><br/>My job is directly impacted by AI generated images. I will not call it art, because that is not what it is. Art is created by humans. It has soul and intention behind it. The work of human beings is being stolen and used to train datasets that companies directly profit from while the artists who spent hours on their creation do not see a penny. In no way is this just. AI will not only come for my job, but everyone else&#39;s if we do not make an effort to temper the rampant use of it. AI should not be allowed to be copyrighted, its backbone is built on stolen work. AI is anti-American, anti human, and anti competition.
