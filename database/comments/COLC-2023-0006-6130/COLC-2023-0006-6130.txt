I find that AI (or truly, &quot;Computer Generated,&quot; as I will refer to it, seeing as these programs are not &quot;intelligent,&quot; but pattern recognition and repetition.) should not be trained with copyrighted material, as it would not be &quot;fan-made&quot; (fan art, fan fiction, or an otherwise fan-made interpretation or expansion on the original material. These are things that take time and effort.) but rather, cheap imitations. I also find that computer generation data should not be allowed to &quot;learn&quot; from images, audio, writing, or films that are not public domain- there are already laws about piracy for humans, but there should be laws against piracy and copyright infringement for computer generations as well. Further, I believe that using computer generation should not be copyrighted- regardless of the amount of human interference. Computer generation is based on patterns and pattern recognition- therefore, not only would this &quot;original&quot; creation be a regurgitation of whatever buzzwords it was made to use, anyone with the same buzzwords could create the same thing. It would not be an original thought, and therefore should not be able to be copyrighted. Also, if computer generation infringes on copyright law, the repercussions should be applied to the person who was controlling the computer at that time. Finally, AI should not be allowed to mimic voices or styles of human artists unless in parody or at the specific allowance of the singer/public figure (should this person be deceased, the computer may freely use it, as it does not create competition, unless specifically requested by the deceased or the family of the deceased.), as it creates unfair competition for artists.
