As someone who works with generative AI, I believe that materials generated by AI should generally not be copyrightable, except under a specific circumstance. If and only if all training data for the model is sourced by the user of the model, with permission granted by the owners of all training material used directly to the model creator for this specific purpose (i.e. granted for this specific model, not generic permission granted for use in ANY model), then the user may copyright content generated by the model. If a user other than the person or company who sourced/generated training data for the model attempts to use the model, the model&#39;s output will not be copyrightable by that user. If the model is used to generate content outside the parameters that the creators of the training data used in the model agreed to, that content should not be copyrightable. In addition, no site or company hosting user-generated content (such as social media or art gallery websites) should be able to grant permission for that user-generated content to be used as training data for an AI model; permission must be given by the actual creator of the data, no matter how small the data is or how difficult it would be to contact the creator. No service hosting user-generated content should be able to require users to give up their content to the service to use in training data as part of a EULA, either; by default, all content must be assumed to not be usable in training data, unless permission is explicitly granted by the user.
