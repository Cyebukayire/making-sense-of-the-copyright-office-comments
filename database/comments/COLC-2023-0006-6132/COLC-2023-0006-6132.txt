AI generated images are created from artworks of many artists who never consented for their works to be used in the database. AI does not learn the same way humans do nor have the same creativity, and there have been many cases of AI image prompters deliberately producing plagiarized artworks, only minorly tweaking some details from the original artwork created by human artists. Until more people learn how to respect human artists, AI image generators should have more restrictions on its usage.
