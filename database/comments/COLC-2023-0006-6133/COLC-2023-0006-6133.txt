AI used in spaces of chatbots, video, voice, writing, and art is nothing but exploitation. In regards to chatbots, it has scraped the posts of people who have no idea there data is being used in this way until now. With video and voice, it mimics actual people, it can be dangerous. We have seen this with deepfakes and then now with reports of scammers using voice bots to mimic family members. With writing and art, it is the exploitation of creative labor, much of which has been posted in good faith. Particularly, we have seen fan spaces with fanfics and fanart. We know these have been scraped and used because there is no way sudowrite or chat gpt could know what omegaverse is without scrapping this and with the other technology that arose after these AI technologies gained popularity (chat role-play, writing bots) that tried to commercialize fanfics and the like. With the artwork, go to nearly any artist on Twitter or other social media and you will see in their bio that they do not allow reposting, and I would argue that scraping art images like this falls under this. It is taking the art work and using it for gain. You can see with the uproar of AI art being similar to artist styles and people using it to not have to pay artists. <br/><br/>AI at it&#39;s core is extractive. It cannot be innovative. It cannot be novel. While some may find the new AI technology useful, this country does not have any of the proper data protections that would protect people from having their work stolen for these databases for corporate gain. The lack of data protections only enhances the exploitation of the latest and upcoming AI technologies. These databases should be completely wiped. Companies should have to start over. No personal or creative data should be able to be used in these AI systems to create things that others will turn around and claim as their own.
