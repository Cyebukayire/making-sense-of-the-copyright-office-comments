As a visual artist in the age of the internet I&rsquo;m afraid to show my work knowing that if I make anything marketable it will be photographed and posted online where ai companies can non-consensually scrape that image and feed it to machine learning systems so they can replicate my techniques down to my signature. This technology should not be legal.<br/>
