I strongly oppose the idea that works produced by programs being pitched as &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; could be eligible for Copyright. &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; is a misleading label as these programs are not intelligent in any capacity. They are very good at applied probability, given that they have enough data to construct a model from which to produce images, text, or sound.  In order to construct that model, corporations have copied a mind-boggling amount of data that does not exist in the public domain without consent or compensation.  The model does not work without that data; the program is not &quot;inspired&quot; by the works it references, it has no memory and indeed no creativity.  An artist does not have to have a copy of the Mona Lisa with them at all times to be inspired by it.  Moreover, the works that are produced by these programs are in direct competition with the artists, writers, and actors from which the data was taken.  A customer who pays, say, Midjourney, can &quot;prompt&quot; the program to produce a work in the style of a named artist and it will reference the material in its database to produce it at a fraction of the time and cost to the end user.  How does this not violate the spirit of Copyright?  <br/><br/>Arthur C. Clarke once said that &quot;any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,&quot; and in my youth I took that to mean that our fabulous modern devices would seem like magic to people of the past.  However in this present moment it applies not because I do not understand the technology, but rather that its effects are things that are only known to us through the lens of fantastical fiction.  When the Walt Disney Corporation uses generative A.I. to imitate Mark Hamill&#39;s voice for &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, how is this not unlike their very own Ursula the Sea Witch stealing Ariel&#39;s voice?  The audience recognizes Ursula as the villain in that scenario; why do we not do so here?  The technology as it has been developed and marketed is the tool of a grasping, rapacious monster and it need not be granted the protections given to real creative persons.
