AI is not original. It is not making intelligent decisions the way humans do. AI art or other products are not truly created. They are the distorted result of other information being thrown in a proverbial blender. A human artist is constantly making decisions. Every line is a choice. AI is not doing that. It&rsquo;s at best a funhouse mirror mashing up multiple images until it tricks us into thinking it is something new. Copyright should only be applied to creations that were actually created. There is no truly new ideas in AI, only theft.
