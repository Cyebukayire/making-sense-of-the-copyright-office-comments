Hi there, let me be frank: the collection, distribution and storing of millions of artworks without any permission or notification (theft and breach of privacy), by organisations aiming to directly replace and compete with the most human field of activity (for monetization), to churn a profit is a direct violation of copyright. Especially since the algorithms used are blatantly modifying, adjusting and remixing works without any permission from those who hold the intellectual property of the works. This is not fair use. This is not ethical. This is not respectful. It could be understandable if this was purely for research purposes without a profit in mind. However these models are already making money from exploiting existing work. This is dangerous. Already tech giants and social media CEOs are enforcing &quot;backdoors&quot; around any prospective laws regarding AI and copyright, by changing their terms and conditions to allow them access to personal materials for this purpose in perpetuity. This is not advertised and is not being conducted in good faith with any community outside of the &quot;techbro cult.&quot; Already the saturation of AI generated imagery rivals the imagery made by humans online, which coupled with text based algorithms, is going to lead to an internet where we cannot trust anything to be real, legitimate information, or human in correspondence. I have seen software like ChatGPT being used in classrooms to write full assignments without any repercussions - as well as some court cases. This is no longer a question of copyright. This is a question as to whether human culture and our ability to communicate visually through images and text should be protected, or disregarded. In my opinion at least, tech evolution and the automation of services was supposed to address industries that cripple the body and lead to soul sucking lives, not the fields that define humans as what we are.
