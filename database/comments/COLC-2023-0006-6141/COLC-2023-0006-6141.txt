I am an author. My ability to make a living is being seriously impacted by AI-written books flooding Amazon. I&#39;m not a person to stand in the way of progress, but the people behind these books are not putting human creativity into these works. Copyright is for people who take the time to do the work, not for people who own the right  machines or software. If AI generated art, music, and books gain copyright status, authors will stop writing, painters will stop painting, and musicians stop composing. Creating is what makes us different from machines. Don&#39;t let the machines take over what it means to be human.
