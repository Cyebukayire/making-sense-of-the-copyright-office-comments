I have been an artist for about six years now, going on seven, or at least I&rsquo;ve started taking a passion and really giving it serious thought towards my future. I practice every single day and have even taken commissions of up to $200-300. Although that seems like a large amount, at least to myself, it is not nearly enough to sustain my life yet. I have improved so much and I&rsquo;m genuinely very very proud of where I&rsquo;ve come. <br/><br/>My thoughts, when I saw somebody successfully selling prints clearly run through an AI program and trained on what is clearly my own work, as well as others from my friends was immense dread. I have done research and understand how these technologies work and it is nothing short of blatant plagiarism. These systems run by &quot;copying&quot; copyrighted works into datasets &amp;  getting the AI to reproduce (copy) BILLIONS of images as part of its &quot;learning&quot; process. AI systems can&#39;t work without &quot;copying&quot; &amp; making &quot;derivatives&quot; of copyrighted images. They do not learn the same way humans do, they are thoughtless and they only require the equivalent of a google search to create any image conceivable in the style of myself, or my friends. It is almost like tying a corpse to puppet strings and getting paid to make it dance. I have even seen my own watermarks scrambled and torn apart within these images after the system attempted to remove it along with my own credit for it.<br/><br/>I would like to enter the art industry however these industries are run by greedy parasites, if i may bring attention to ongoing strikes that have erupted, they are fighting not to be trained and replaced by their own work through these systems. It is absolutely disgusting how this could even be a possibility, however the corporations behind these systems market them to directly replace us and nothing else. If you allow this technology to be profitable in the slightest, millions of people will lose their livelihoods because their employers do not care about anything other than what will make their pockets deeper, it is not fair.<br/><br/>The people who defend this technology will read articles that explain exactly how it works and proceed to say nothing but &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie, you don&rsquo;t know how it works&rdquo; even if it&rsquo;s directly sourced from the people who made it. These people are the only ones who are ever questioned or asked about how something like this could be ethical although they are not and will never be impacted by the existence of these systems. Their opinions need to be discarded and treated like gibberish before they can do more harm than they&rsquo;ve already done to the creative community. I cannot express how awful it is to open any social media app and get slammed in the face with 40 different profiles posting and selling deepfake porn of real people or even children because it&rsquo;s cheap and easy, without the requirements of asking for consent or being forced to pay the people whose images were used in return. <br/><br/>Opt out systems are deceptive to people who are unaware of this technology and many systems that are sold prey on new artists that are unaware their art is being scraped in the first place. They also remain uncompensated. <br/><br/>Please do nothing to help AI in the creative industry, regulate it until nobody can use it for personal gain. They cannot function without existing work provided by people who don&rsquo;t have a say in the process. This is black and white, good versus bad.
