<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI is fine as long as it&rsquo;s the kind that doesn&rsquo;t take other people&rsquo;s work. The art community will be and has been hurt by how some artificial intelligence &lsquo;tools&rsquo; have been stealing their art and creating new ones to be sold, advertised, etc. not even with credits. 30 years of practice and effort is flushed away when a computer can just steal some art (or even anything that isn&rsquo;t theirs) and make something within minutes. They can even sell it saying that the image is original, which should be illegal. It&rsquo;s robbery. Apparently not all ai is licensed, and it definitely should be. ATLEAST that.
