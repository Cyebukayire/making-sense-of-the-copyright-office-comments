AI image generators (ex. Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.) are made up of entirely stolen images (https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/artificial-intelligence-ai-art-ethics-greg-rutkowski-1.6679466); and as such should not be able to be copyrighted or used for any major commercial work. While yes, it does create very good-looking things faster than an artist could and can in fact help artists, it couldn&#39;t do that without training off of the artist&#39;s work. As a illustrator and animator myself; I have watched the negative effects of AI image generators get worse and worse over time. The longer this goes on at the rate it does, the more likely artists are to be put out of work. It&#39;s already starting to happen with writers in Hollywood after the SAG-AFTRA strike began, and possibly even before that (https://www.sagaftrastrike.org/why-we-strike).<br/>Not to mention the real-life impacts it will have as well. With deepfakes and AI generated voices becoming more and more of a problem, even just the everyday person can be framed for something horrific, or nonconsensually had sexually explicit material made of them as long as it was recorded (though AI image generators can be put to use for the exact same thing as well). Stricter AI laws NEED to be put in place. AI very much can help people, but not when it&#39;s as unregulated as it currently is.
