AI should not be allowed to use copyrighted material as these learning models are oftened trained to target, identify, and remove any artists&#39; logos/watermarks/signatures/branding, this leads to reduced traction and loss in potential income for the artists that these AI were trained to scrape from. AI content produced without the significant involvement of a human being should not be allowed to be copyrighted as per the reason above. AI training models have a large pool of free to use, properly cited Creative Commons medias, and works released to the public without any commercial or personal license restrictions to train from. There is no reason for AI to be training from copyrighted works when existing easy to access data is available to these AI companies or original works can be produced for the AI to train from.
