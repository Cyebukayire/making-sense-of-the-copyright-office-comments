I do not think that something that is created by Artificial Intelligence should be able to be copyrighted. The reason I think this is because many of these programs are taught by scanning the work of other people without credit or compensation to the people they are scanning from. Unscrupulous people could then sell that, even though they aren&#39;t the ones that created it.
