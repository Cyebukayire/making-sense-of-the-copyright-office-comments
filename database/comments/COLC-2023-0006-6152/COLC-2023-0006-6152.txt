Using someone&#39;s copyright material without permission to train an eye is a violation of copyright, particularly if it is monetized, since it is a theft of the work. I also agree that anything autonomously generated by an AI should not be able to be copyrighted, since there is no actual author. <br/>If the work has infringing material, it&#39;s entirely reasonable to hold them liable, since it is an infringement. Being used to imitate a particular artist is damaging them financially and could even be used for identity theft, and doing such a thing suggests you have been using that artists work without their permission to train the AI.
