The current status of AI within the art community is one of theft and confusion. In the light of recent judicial decisions, of denying the claim of copyright over AI art due to its lack of human creation and creativity, the same ideals should be applied towards its regulations. The artists who have had their art stolen without consent deserve to be compensated or credited when it comes to the use of their works. AI should be used as a tool not as a replacement.
