Third parties absorb a lot of data from all persons engaged with their company. We are to sign and agree to use their platforms with this is mind, but many users are unaware of this. I understand the the U.S. Copyright Office has no authority over that, and it is up to the user who agreed upon the terms they provide, but it must be considered when overviewing the topic of Artificial Intelligence and it&rsquo;s impacts of users of the third party companies. I believe this must be talked about more with the users affected by the harm Artificial intelligence can do. I do not agree that all AI use is bad but I believe it MUST have a limit. That limit I&rsquo;d like to keep in mind is the creative aspect that AI is generating. I&rsquo;ve seen work generated by AI and it is good work but there is a major issues I have with it. Many third party companies take data from their users to let their artificial intelligence generate something new, but not original. They take from artists who do not copyright every creative project they have worked on and use it to generate other art. There is no credit whatsoever. Regardless of copyright. Copyright should not matter in the means of causally having a creative output. Creativity is the valuable. Creative is what makes people, human beings. We need it for ourselves. We do not need artificial intelligence to create artwork. It is for the living, and should stay with us. To add more to my claim, the artwork produced is not original work of the artificial intelligence instead it is the work of many other artists. All AI art is a bunch of art from real human beings. That is how people make art. Other artists inspire one another to create, but AI art is not inspired. It is stolen. There isn&rsquo;t any motivation behind artificial intelligence. You can&rsquo;t see in inner workings or how it got from one place to the other. There is nothing more to creative projects generate by AI than stolen digits.
