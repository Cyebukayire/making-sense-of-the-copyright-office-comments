AI is a huge infringement on literally every extant copyright in the US. Any copyrighted material could be stolen by this, frankly, unintelligent technology that is full of bugs, wastes enormous amounts of energy and water and human effort, with very little benefit. See reporting such as: https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/01/tech/eating-disorder-chatbot/index.html, showing that all AI does is unintelligently inhale the good, the bad, and the ugliest aspects of humanity online and spit it back out in a nonsensical, uncritical, unintelligent mess that can get people killed while simultaneously using stolen jargon from actual experts and infringing on their copyright of their intelligent, critical, lifesaving work.
