As someone with a vested interest in the future protection of human art, I have complex feelings about the current state of generative AI. <br/>To put the most important parts first: <br/>1. I don&#39;t believe that anything produced with generative AI should be awarded copyright protections in any respect; <br/>2. I believe that large commercial endeavors that rely on generative AI for the majority of any specific section (voice acting, animation, backgrounds, character design, performance) should likewise not be viable for any copyright protection, in order to dissuade producers of popular media from relying on it for all creative work; <br/>3. I believe that the datasets used in generative AI should be 100% consensually sourced, and any nonconsensual or unknown utilization of a human&#39;s work should be grounds for legal recourse under the intellectual property protections currently in place for creative work;<br/>4. Generative AI should never be given safe harbor under &quot;Transformative Work&quot; or &quot;Fair Use&quot; the way that human creatives are, as computers are incapable of making &quot;decisions&quot; and therefore are incapable of using another&#39;s work fairly.<br/><br/>The current state of the entertainment industry the world over is a clear explanation of my reasoning for these assertions. We stand on the precipice of a technological revolution that, if utilized correctly, could change the world for the better. Generative AI can be used in research settings to great effect, helping to understand everything from color theory to the earliest indications of cancer; instead, in the present day, it&#39;s being used to allow large media corporations to terminate their creative staff in favor of generative AI engines trained on their work, allowing these companies to profit off their employees&#39; efforts forever with no compensation to those employees. Likewise, it&#39;s causing a dramatic surge in unemployment in all creative industries, from art to acting, and is currently in the process of overwhelming educational writing industries with AI generated books created using industry professionals&#39; work, but not approved or even reviewed by any of those professionals. By denying copyright protections to generative AI produced work (and work created on a backdrop of generative AI content) and enforcing the human right to compensation for their work by requiring datasets be consensually sourced, this worsening issue can be cut off before it&#39;s able to completely decimate every creative industry humans have ever made.<br/><br/>There are ethical ways to utilize generative AI, as stated above. There are use cases for these engines and programs. There are many, many places that this can be applied in a way that doesn&#39;t serve as an undeniable threat to human creations, but there is currently no single use that has been anything other than exploitative and harmful to these industries. Allowing people to profit off the work of others is precisely what copyright protections are supposed to fight against, and allowing those protections to work like this is antithetical to the very spirit of intellectual property protections. For a work to be copyrightable, it must be created by a human being.<br/><br/>By asserting that the inputting of prompts into a generative engine constitutes &quot;human creativity,&quot; copyright law would then have to extend protections to people selling photocopied prints of copyrighted imagery, or selling mix CD&#39;s of copyrighted music. The process of placing the art on the platen of a photocopier, choosing the right paper stock, making color corrections and hitting &quot;COPY&quot; is human input, but it&#39;s not enough human input to warrant legal protection. The process of selecting the right files to burn to a CD or load into a file collection, standardizing the naming structure of those files and making sure metadata appears as preferred is also human input, and the combination of multiple tracks from different artists in a unique order could even be called &quot;transformative,&quot; but it&#39;s not enough human input and it&#39;s not transformative enough to warrant legal protection. If a person can&#39;t copyright a photocopy of Mickey Mouse that&#39;s been mirrored, scaled up 10% and had the contrast turned up, AI generated work cannot be copyrighted. Full stop.<br/><br/>Because a computer cannot be held accountable for mistakes, computers should not be allowed to make &quot;decisions.&quot; Likewise, because a computer cannot understand the concept of human creativity and ethics, a computer&#39;s &quot;creative&quot; works should not be legally protected.
