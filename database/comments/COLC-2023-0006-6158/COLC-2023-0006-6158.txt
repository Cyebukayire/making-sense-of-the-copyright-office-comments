Under no circumstances should machine learning output data be copyright-eligible. Ever. Machines are not people. Algorithms are not people. Only people can create a work eligible for copyright protection. Machine learning does not produce original work but rather a chewed-up mash of actual humans&#39; protected works without permission or knowledge of the original copyright holder, bypassing copyright protections by claiming to use so little of the original works that it qualifies as Fair Use. Not a single original element exists within data generated via machine learning. Do not get this confused with real AI. There is no artificial intelligence. It has not been invented, and going off our current transistor development speeds, won&#39;t happen for a century. This is machine learning and nothing else, which is nothing more than a machine trying to repeat patterns it finds in a provided dataset. It&#39;s nothing more than a complicated mechanism techbros are using to steal copyrighted works and then claim ownership of them. It&#39;s nothing more than a means to undermine an already-exploited labor force, particularly in the creative arts, while manual labor jobs theoretically ideal for automation are still left in human hands for minimum wage. Do not miss the forest for the trees. Machine learning is a toy. Do not let it become a weapon.
