AIs have to be trained to be usable. And the only way to train an AI to be functional is to feed it a MASSIVE amount of data. As such, most companies will train their AIs by scouring endless material from the internet, all of which someone else made, none of which they have permission for, and most of which is copywritten. Teaching an AI to make things by feeding it text or art made by other people, without getting the consent of all of the people who made that text or art, is equivalent to theft. It&#39;s a fascinating technology, but it kills the potential jobs of the artists and writers that it steals from in order to learn.
