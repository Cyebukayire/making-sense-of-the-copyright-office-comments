My logical understanding of artificial intelligence in the creation of art is simply this. If two humans, given the same AI, can create the same piece of art given the same inputs, then that art is not copyrightable. You cannot argue that there is any human element, regardless of whether humans played a role in the creation of said art, because the art will always be created exactly the same given the same exact inputs. That is inherently inhuman; no two humans on Earth will ever be able to replicate such a feat, even if you ask them to resort to forgery.
