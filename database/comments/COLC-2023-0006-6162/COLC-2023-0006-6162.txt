<br/>Hi there. I am a freelance eco-artist, advocate, and storyteller who has had their work trained for use in an AI image generator without permission. I am not a commercial artist, so my feedback concerns ethical/legal impacts rather than financial damages. Just as there are some things that can&rsquo;t be sold, there are some things money cannot compensate for. This guides my thinking when I interact with the idea of copyright law and AI.<br/><br/>First, some thoughts about how AI works:<br/><br/>I think of AI as a complicated form of collage, which is based on pattern-recognition. The larger its training database gets, the more bits and pieces can be mixed and matched, and the more &ldquo;original&rdquo;-feeling the outcome. However, even the most sophisticated generator cannot &ldquo;create&rdquo; something from nothing&mdash;that is to say, no matter how unique the output seems, it is strictly a product of the patterns that it has learned from the source dataset. It cannot create new patterns or have new ideas&mdash;someone has to create something new and introduce it to the AI in order for the AI to mimic it. The influence that the original works have upon the system are never truly gone, only obfuscated.<br/><br/>Second, some thoughts about other legal frameworks:<br/><br/>Federally-funded research that deals with human subjects must seek informed consent from research participants, and has certain responsibilities for protecting personal information when it becomes part of this generalizable knowledge that we call science. While this is not the case for private research, many organizations still have their own, internal ethics policies to prevent misconduct.<br/><br/>Similarly, the collection of personal data for advertising purposes&mdash;while not regulated at the federal level&mdash;is de-facto regulated by a mixture of state and international laws. Typically, users of a website are informed that their data may be collected for advertising purposes, and allowed to opt out of personalized data collection (at least to some degree.)<br/><br/>I reference these two frameworks because&mdash;much like AI&mdash;they are collecting pieces of individual data, identifying patterns, and using those patterns to create a product. <br/><br/>It may be difficult to think of art or writing as &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; in the way that it exists in research or advertising. Here, the source of harm is typically from personal data getting into the wrong hands, or becoming identifiable. In the arts, we typically want our work to be identifiable. However, I would argue that identification is still an issue with AI training sets, as not all artists create work that is ethical/safe to publicize or reproduce, even in a derivative way. An example is artists whose works are protected under the Indian Arts and Crafts Act&mdash;would it be right to include these in commercial datasets without consent? Would it be right to ask an AI generator to generate photos of a Katsina dance, when photographing these dances has been forbidden for over a century by the Hopi Nation, and is part of their protected intellectual property? <br/><br/>This is only one example of the legal-ethical issues with AI that is trained without consent. I offer this perspective in addition to the points that other, better-spoken artists have already made.<br/><br/>Last, some thoughts about solutions:<br/><br/>I believe only a consent-based, &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo; model for AI training can ensure infringements don&rsquo;t happen. There are no shortages of commercial, public domain, and creative commons stock repositories that have jumped on the opportunity to create such training models. I believe artists, too, would enthusiastically participate&mdash;for free or with compensation&mdash;when provided the chance. <br/><br/>I cannot comment on what adequate compensation for damages might look like. The damages have been ethical more than monetary, for me (though I very much dislike the idea of a company making money off of work that I have chosen not to monetize.) I defer to others in this area.<br/><br/>Finally, I&rsquo;m not convinced that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;too late,&rdquo; or that these AI generators are a Pandora&rsquo;s Box that can never be closed again. I believe creating the space for ethically-trained generators can do quite a lot of good, and I&rsquo;m sincerely thrilled to be in a space where many different people are trying to find a way forward. Thank you for your time, I hope you find something useful in here.
