AI as it stands now it&#39;s the result of intellectual property theft. The results are only possible thanks to the appropriation of copyrighted material for their databases. These databases are very skewed towards certain artists, not all the images have the same weight in the final image, a few artists have been stolen thousands of times just in the last few months. It needs to be regulated ASAP.
