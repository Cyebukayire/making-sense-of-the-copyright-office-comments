I do not support generative AI. These data sets are created using stolen work and private data of individuals without our consent, and being used for profit by corporations. These data sets use copyrighted material illegally and exploit private data. They also put many jobs at risk and threaten to replace many fields. These are not tools, tools are designed to assist people, not replace them. They also pose to much risk for misinformation, deep fakes/ impersonations, and scams. AI companies need to be held accountable for their theft and tie technology needs to be strongly regulated.
