AI cannot get a copyright by training on other copyrighted material if it reiterates with variation on said works.  If it uses other copyrighted works, the author of the copyright is entitled to royalties. This would, theoretically also apply to other AIs creating content from other AIs copyright. This may cause a perverse incentive to create lots of content, faster than a human can, with low, unoriginal, quality, only to crowd out potentially more quality content that comes from original thought.  Also, I concerned that this form can be abused by bots submitting answers in favor of a particular outcome&hellip;. Even with the reCAPTCHA.
