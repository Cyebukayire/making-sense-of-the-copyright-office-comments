We should stand opposed against AI, considering a number of reasons but mainly there are three urgent concerns. The ethical, the legal, and the environmental. AI generators cannot be made, trained, etc WITHOUT scraping art from artists without consent. This has already presented issues in the work industry with many artists losing jobs to be replaced by AI - and legally as well. AI scrapes from copyrighted content too. There are already several cases of AI generators being taken to court for copyright infringements. Environmentally AI has taken its toll. For AI to store, train and generate the amount of content that they do, it drains resources and leaves a large carbon footprint.
