You shouldn&#39;t be allowed to say &quot;in the style of x artist&quot; and then copyright it. In this case, the artist&#39;s work is being used specifically to generate something that competes with them. That&#39;s unacceptable. Although the argument can be made that human artists are trained &quot;in the same way&quot;as ai, namely by looking at thousands of other artist&#39;s work; there is a clear difference between this and ai which can look at much more art and spit out thousands of art pieces each minute. It would be similar to (but much worse than) an individual competing with a large corporation, and we have laws to protect smaller businesses. This is because smaller businesses are essential to innovation and true competition is essential to consumers. The same is true for traditional human made art and this should be protected.
