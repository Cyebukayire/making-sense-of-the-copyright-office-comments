The use of copyrighted works to train AI is theft. The creators of the content are NOT being compensated for this and the AI companies are stealing their work for their own profit. Authors and artists deserve not to have their work used without their permission. <br/><br/>While I think there are potentially useful applications of learned language model text and model-generated artwork, I think the current models built on unethically sourced content, in clear violation of the copyrights held by the original creators of the works. These model-generated creations are not art, cannot be copyrighted as art, and have no place being treated as a replacement for art. <br/><br/>There is already abuse by users of these models who use them to create content and then the users modify the creation and claim it&#39;s their own copyrighted work. These loopholes should not be allowed as they are simply a way for users to bypass the current court rulings that have determined that AI created content cannot be copyrighted. That should include any content that was created by one of these models. Whether it was modified or not.<br/><br/>Thank you.
