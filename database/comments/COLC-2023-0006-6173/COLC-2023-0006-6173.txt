The copyright office&#39;s current stance is easily understood: AI-generated works can not be copyrighted.  This is both simple and comprehensive and there is absolute no valid compelling argument to change this.  A person should be the primary creator through active work, not through a generative prompt, in order for a work to be considered copyrightable.  This is 100 percent consistent with decades of case law and completely unambiguous.  <br/><br/>The whole process of AI model training has too many variables involved.  Generally, there is no way other than exhaustive checking to prove that a model was not trained on uncopyrighted materials, which means that the provenance will always be questionable due to the typical amount of training materials (hundreds of millions of documents) making verification all but impossible.  This becomes more convoluted if some of the materials were copyrighted and the claim that a given AI-generated work did not use that portion of the underlying model, because it is usually not possible to query a model to determine which materials contributed to the generated work. Any weakening of the present stance will result in many legal challenges, some of which will be contradictory in nature as ever more nuanced arguments are brought forward.<br/><br/>Furthermore, all AI-generated materials should, by law, be identified as such and clearly state that there is no explicit or implied copyright on said materials.  They may still be infringing - that is another conversation entirely - but requiring identification and having penalties for mis-identified works (i.e. similar to current infringement penalties) would be of significant benefit for consumers.<br/><br/>Finally, the prompts used for generative AI works should not be copyrightable as well, since identical prompts can generate different output even with the same base model, much less other underlying models.  This should be an obvious extension of the current policy, but I think it should be explicitly stated so as to avoid any confusion and to avoid creating any legal uncertainties. <br/><br/>I thank the Copyright Office for soliciting input on this critical matter.
