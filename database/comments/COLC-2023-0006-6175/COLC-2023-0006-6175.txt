AI works should not be allowed copyright protections, as (more often than not) AI generated material steal from existing assets/products/pieces without the original creator(s) permissions and repurposes it against their will. Unless the AI&#39;s operator can provide evidence that they have the distribution/commercial rights to all the art that was used to create the AI database, anything generated by an AI should be excluded from copyright protection in order to protect the original/actual creators of the gutted/repurposed pieces.<br/><br/>AI generated content should also be subject to lawsuits in the event actual copyright protected work is used in any AI generative database, and that the database&#39;s creators either pay the commercial fees necessary, or effectively remove all copyright protected content from said database.<br/><br/>This should apply to written AI content, AI generated art, AI generated voices, AI generated scripts, AI generated videos, etc. and the enforcement should be universal regardless of what media the AI generated material is in.<br/><br/>This should also apply to large companies, making anything they create under AI generation copyright-free and forfeits them from any royalty gains from said AI generated assets/content, ensuring better quality from said companies and ensuring every day people whom take up the industry do not lose their jobs in an already suffering economy/industry.
