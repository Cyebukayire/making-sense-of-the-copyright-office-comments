I am currently a university student, and I have concerns on the amount of students that have used computationally generated work as their own submissions in the academic sphere. I&#39;ve experienced firsthand that others are using AI tools to misrepresent others&#39; knowledge as their own. Academic papers are contributions of discovery that build on knowledge. The use of compiling  fragments of others&#39; work to pass as your own is a disservice to scholars who work hard for their research. Usage of AI also opens the path for students to gain fraudulent credentials far easier, and put strain on professional fields contending with workers who know nothing. The work of researchers deserves to be protected and credited, not dismantled and regurgitated, and often incorrect.
