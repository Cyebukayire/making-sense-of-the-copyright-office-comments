I am an artist currently working as a freelance illustrator. Knowing that copyright law protects my intellectual property gives me the security I need, as a small business in the creative industry, in order to produce my best work. If artificial intelligence technology is allowed to scrape my work in violation of my copyright, it will be able to produce an infinite number of derivative works, essentially forcing to compete against my own work that was scraped without consent, compensation, and gathered under dubious and unethical standards. Creative works are, themselves, the means by which artists grow their businesses and create new works based on their own, copyright-protected intellectual property. Please preserve and protect copyright and explicitly disallow artificial intelligence corporations and technologies from scraping data from publicly accessible sources. Public access does not grant public use, generative artificial intelligence technologies and corporations should not be given free rein to abuse creatives and use our work without our consent.
