As a freelance artist whose financial stability relies on my ability to post and share my artwork online, AI scraping directly harms and makes difficult any attempt to advertise or make a presence for my business online. Any image I share, even with watermarks or ample warnings, can be and is scraped for use in generative AI training. I have no way to opt into or out of this process, no way to at least charge for the use of my work. What equates more than a days wages in time and skill is instantly harvested and regurgitated without my consent and at no benefit to me. In this process, it even manages to steal many potential clientele, and the hit to morale is devastating. How am I supposed to compete with AI trained on the work I myself make? It can&#39;t add the flair I can, it can&#39;t fine tune or create anew - but I can&#39;t possibly compete with the speed at which it creates, nor at the financial level. <br/><br/>I am being priced out of my market by an entity stealing my work and the work of every other artist I know. Hundreds if not thousands of creative jobs are likely to be lost to this, and for what? Being a creative in this market is the most barren and disheartening It&#39;s ever been, and it only gets worse the less protections artists have.
