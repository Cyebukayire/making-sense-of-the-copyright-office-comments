The term &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; is still a misnomer. ChatGPT, OpenAi, and other such services labeled &#39;AI&#39; are still not intelligences with the capacity for thought. They are a sophisticated mathematical model, descended from the humble predictive text function on a text-capable phone. An &#39;AI&#39; or predictive model is by definition the sum of its parts: it cannot synthesize anything new, only take very clever and complex averages of the training data given to it. <br/><br/>Due to this lack of synthesis, it&#39;s my opinion that the &#39;artist&#39; who inputs a prompt or other input to AI and attempts to trademark the output has no claim to anything except for the original prompt, because the algorithm they have fed their idea into is incapable of making anything new out of it. <br/><br/>Predictively generated works in all mediums can be of good quality or bad, delightful, disturbing, or bland. But they are not the product of a creative mind.  A prompt fed into a black box averaging a massive amount of data does not create a definitively unique work. In fact, since the AI services have no memory from one operation to the next, they have no inbuilt way to prevent accidental duplication of their output. <br/><br/>I am not a computer scientist, mathematician, or copyright lawyer, but I am at least very certain that an AI as it stands in 2023 is not a conscious creator, nor is the process sufficiently unique to make its output a copyrightable creation even when guided by a human&#39;s input.
