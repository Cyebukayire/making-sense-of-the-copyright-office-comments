In my opinion, generative AI is dangerous to all mankind. Firstly, since AI draws from the vast reservoir of collective human knowledge that is the Internet and consolidates it into one package, the privatization of AI would mean the privatization of just about anything that could issue from mankind&#39;s collective knowledge. In essence, privatized AI would enable corporations to copyright all mankind&#39;s dreams and ideas of the future before human minds can dream them. A few elites would have absolute power over most, if not all of humanity&#39;s memories, knowledge, dreams, and potential inventions. And what are humans without imagination or dreams? If AI is to be privatized and its products copyrighted in any way, being human will become a privilege for those who can afford AI. It is an existential threat to the humanity of so many people, especially among the lower classes. As AI makes imagination obsolete, the only jobs left for humans will be those of mindless drudgery - and at that point we shall be no more than the machines we used to rule over. So, for the sake of all mankind, do all that is within your power to ensure that no AI can be privatized, and that no product of AI can be copyrighted or transcribed into a copyrightable form. As long as AI can make obsolete the human mind, it is an existential threat, not just to the economy, not just to America, but to the entire human race, and particularly to the proletariat.
