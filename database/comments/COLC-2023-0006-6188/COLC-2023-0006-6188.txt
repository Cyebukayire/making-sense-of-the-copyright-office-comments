AI and individuals who own/use AI should have no right to copyright anything produced through the artificial intelligence PERIOD. It pulls art from millions of artists WITHOUT their permission. Those who use AI are not creating anything from their own hands, instead they are cobbling together others art and profiting off it it with no repercussions or regulations. Without real human-made art, &quot;AI Art&quot; would not exist. It is not created from a vaccuum. We did not agree for our art to be at the will of AI corporations.
