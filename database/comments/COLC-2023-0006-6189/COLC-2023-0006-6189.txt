I don&rsquo;t think any AI generated works should be able to be copyrighted, considering they are all generated from other existing works that may or may not be copyrighted, and considering no human is responsible for synthesizing and amalgamating the existing works into an original work I think it is impossible to grant a copyright to any party. The other important factor to consider is that many people do not consent to their works being used for AI generation, so granting copyrights to generated works would be both disrespectful to artists and writers and it would possibly lead to further legal issues.<br/>Don&rsquo;t let AI works get copyrighted.
