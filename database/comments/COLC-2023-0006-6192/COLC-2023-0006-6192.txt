Hi I&#39;m an artist. I was never asked or given the opportunity to opt out of AI training sets. AI systems should not be allowed to just scrape the internet and steal and manipulate the art that real people make. They especially shouldn&#39;t be allowed to make some kind of faux collage of our art for commercial purposes. Art that is not made by humans shouldn&#39;t be copyrighted. This isn&#39;t progress it&#39;s theft.
