Thanks for taking the time to address this issue. My comment is fairly simple, that &#39;AI&#39; as it is colloquially known, deserves no copyright protections, since all works generated by &#39;AI&#39; are derivative of their training data. The data used for training requires attention too, like how most modern data sets of that type all include protected works and information, which shouldn&#39;t be allowed either. If a company wants to use data to train their algorithm, they can pay for it&#39;s use, so long as they even get the okay from the author.
