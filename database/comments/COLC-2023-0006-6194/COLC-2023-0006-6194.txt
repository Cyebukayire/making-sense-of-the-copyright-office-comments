AI is not helping creatives in the field of music, writing or art. It is stealing from hard working creatives. It is not something that should be used instead of giving people payment for their hard work and skill sets. An artist should not have to worry about their work being scraped and stolen to be funneled in AI program to generate the most repulsive version of their craft! AI in this way is plain and simple theft of creative people!  It is a plague that is ravaging and will have dangerous consequences. For example AI renerating books on Amazon are not only stealing stops from writers but publishes misinformation. There are wild life foragers warning people to not buy those books because someone could get sick from the misinformation of the specific wild plant. I am a visual artist and I am one of the many voices saying enough is enough. These AI &ldquo; artists&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t creating they are stealing someone else&rsquo;s work having their program train on it without the consent or paying the artist who&rsquo;s work they are using. They are saturating and ruining many places people use to look for reference images as well. It&rsquo;s out of hand and honestly those companies making those AI programming should be looked into. They have stolen many images from creatives without pay or consent. AI should not be allowed to have any copyrights . It is stealing from so many of us hard working creatives.
