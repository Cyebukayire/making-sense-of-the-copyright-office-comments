Databases built off of work without consent is theft, plain and simple. There is no ethical way to steal and profit off others through an algorithm or database. <br/>A.I. is a tool like any other, but like a tool it must have regulations. There is nothing wrong in using A.I. to streamline a project if you are feeding it your own original work, whether as an individual or as a collaborative effort between multiple people on the same page. That is where copyright comes in.<br/><br/>You cannot realistically expect every single person to know the intricacies and consequences of A.I. before using it. A standard must be set. Whether it&#39;s writers, artists, animators, programmers, or even students using it to cheat on their homework-plagiarism and theft are immoral. Doing it through an technology with an increase of accessibility does not change this simple, yet important, moral. <br/><br/>Laborers are entitled to the fruits of their labor. We must not, and cannot, confuse advancements in technology as excuses to throw away doing what is right. It would not be okay to misuse a firearm or an automobile just as much as as it would not be okay to let A.I. run rampant and steal jobs. That is why we must legislate accordingly and to do so is a moral failure. The U.S. can and will set a precedent for other countries to follow.<br/><br/>I work in a factory, I am down to Earth, and I am a law abiding citizen. I believe in justice, and I believe that standing up on this issue is doing what is right. <br/><br/>Hypothetically speaking, would you really want to live in a world where the majority of art you consume was pulled from the same databases? Would you want textbooks to regurgitate from each other? Would you want to teach your children that stealing is okay? This is not hyperbole. This is not a joke. <br/><br/>Innovation and creativity go hand in hand with the human touch. As much as technology has made our lives easier, which I am grateful for, it is not an excuse to stop living them.<br/><br/>I am not an emotional person, but I am begging everyone who is reading this to heed my words: to justify stealing others&#39; work without their consent is a dangerous slope. If we go down that road, there is no telling when or if it will stop.<br/><br/>Please stop this madness. Please be the country I know we can be. Please stand together as the people, like we should be. It is in everyone&#39;s best interest to stand against having your work stolen, whether they see it or not yet.
