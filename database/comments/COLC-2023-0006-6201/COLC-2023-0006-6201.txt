I am aware of AI&#39;s potential on how it can make and generate art. While technology has its advantages, it also, at the same time, comes at the risk of exploiting people&#39;s art without the consent of the individuals who work on the art. I understand that companies are spending billions in generative AI to make art, voices, and everything under AI with various means. And I&#39;m worried on it&#39;s potential violations with copyright and AI.<br/><br/>Copyright&#39;s purpose is to indeed, protect the individual&#39;s work from unauthorized use with AI. However, the lawsuits we are seeing shows how many artists are now worried about AI&#39;s use to exploit every artist&#39;s own works. AI won&#39;t just infringe these rights, it eliminates the artist&#39;s career path and the damage is much much worse. The technology that is already used, from all the source code and everything in between, is there to help exploit artists. I urge that action should be made to protect artists from AI and to ensure they have copyright protections from AI. I appreciate your concerns and I hope you take the artists views into consideration. Thank you.
