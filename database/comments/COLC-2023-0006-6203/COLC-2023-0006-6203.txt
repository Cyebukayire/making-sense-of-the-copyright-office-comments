I believe that the government needs to step in and add more regulations on the use of AI. <br/><br/>Although it has been a dream of the future to use AI and robots and improving technology to lessen the work needed by human labor, this dream always came with the idea that the supplanted humans would be able to live better lives without worry or stress or even manual labor, depending on the fantasy and the degree to which technology rises. Instead, these people are uprooted without a better life in sight or mind.<br/><br/>Right now, this applies largely to those in the field of arts and creativity; their works, often given or shown liberally on published or submitted pieces to drive interest to their own abilities, are scraped from their portfolios with wild abandon and a lack of respect and understanding for the effort the originators had put in. Likenesses, art, voices--anything and everything that can be uploaded are now downloaded and fed to AI datasets, largely without permission of the uploader. After which, anyone can use this art--now turned into bits, bytes, and data--and aggregate it all into their own creation.<br/><br/>Then, what happens to the original creator? They, whose services were usurped, are no longer sought for what others can now obtain &quot;for free.&quot; Tens of millions of collective hours spent honing their craft, now all swept away by those who claim no benefit and yet put a price on stolen talents of those still yet living in conditions more and more against them. These original creatives cannot halt the emotionless, tireless trawling of programmed data collectors, and they cannot stop the greed of moral-less thieves who use those pilfered assets for their own gain.<br/><br/>As such, for the sake of those who create in order to keep our lives bearable in times of unease, the author whose words you&#39;ve memorized by heart, the artist whose images decorate your dreams, the actor whose shows you turn to for comfort and familiarity--please instate decrees to control the use of AI now in its beginning stages, before it can grow to do more harm to the community whose livelihoods depend on their lifelong crafts.<br/><br/>As one who is not a legislator, there is only so much I can suggest. I feel it would be an impossible dream to completely wipe away all the existing data in programs such as Midjourney, and to only allow them to include items from opt-in sources only. This would solve the issue of those who do not want their work to be scraped, but be decried by the current users of these programs--though, it is not like the latter cared for the opinions of those being unfairly taken from in the first place.<br/><br/>To leave all flowery words behind, my hope is this: <br/>1) Put a complete stop to the use of AI on human likenesses, barring those who give their explicit permission. In an era plagued by misinformation and &quot;fake news&quot; and media manipulation, AI images using the likeness of real people can cause plenty of damage before it is corrected.<br/>2) Put a complete stop to any further data scraping, including but not limited to images and written words. Any further data must be collected on an opt-in basis, or with explicit permission from the original creator. <br/>3) For those whose works have already been put into AI generators, they must be paid reasonable royalties as all items are to be treated as copyrighted works.<br/>4) Some regulation must be in place for the works of those long-deceased, and for those recently-deceased. For those who still have living direct relatives, let those relatives decide to opt in or out, unless the deceased had their own will regarding AI writ before their passing. Were the works already scraped and used, let the royalties rule apply. For those long-deceased without direct relatives, let their work follow the copyright law of the creator&#39;s life plus seventy years. <br/><br/>I am sure there are many things omitted that those more well-versed in the topic can address, but I sincerely hope that the government takes a close look at and perhaps a heavy hand against AI usage.
