I have been working as professional artist for decades and as such I recognize how important it is to embrace new tools and technologies when attempting to remain competitive in this space. That said, tools like AI have the potential to create immense and widespread harm if misused and as such should be heavily regulated to prevent or otherwise mitigate such harm. To that end, I hereby propose the following regulations for consideration:<br/><br/>1. A unique and easily identifiable tag should be encoded into each and every image produced by regulated AI platforms. This tag should identify not only which AI model was used, but also the artist name, title, and publication date of any and all images used in the generation of said output.<br/><br/>2. Regulated AI platforms can only be trained on individual images to which the developers of said platforms have retained express written consent from the current copyright holder(s). This consent should also be easily revokable at any time via the same written means as the initial consent.<br/><br/>3. Strictly enforced fines, penalties, and/or legal action should be levied against any and all that are found attempting to operate outside these regulations.<br/><br/>4. Copyright enforcement should necessarily engage in the development of tools that aid in the identification of unauthorized and unregulated AI output. Especially where profit is a motive. This same profit motive is also the primary reason that third party tools and technology should not be relied upon to fill this regulatory requirement as it opens the door for conflict of interest.<br/><br/>5. Individual users should not be able to add works to an AI platform&#39;s training data set unless they expressly consent to the same penalties/fines and legal actions that the developers of the AI model would be subject to under part 3.<br/><br/>This list by no means covers all questions posed by the existence of AI, but I strongly feel that if these regulations are imposed, they will have a positive and lasting impact on guiding this emerging technology into a net benefit as opposed to an extreme detriment to the pursuit of human creativity.<br/>
