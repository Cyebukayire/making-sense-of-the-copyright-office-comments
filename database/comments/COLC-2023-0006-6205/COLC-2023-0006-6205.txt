AI Models should be allowed to use copyrighted data in training. The data provided by those copyrightd data is invaluable for improving how AI models function.<br/><br/>AI generated material should default to public domain. Unless in such a case AI can be considered sentient enough to have its own copyright. If a human is involved in AI-generated, I.E. A user requests an image to be generated, then the art should become the copyrighted material of the user/human.<br/>
