Copyrighted works shouldn&#39;t be used to train AI models without the specific consent of the copyright holder.<br/><br/>Because training of an AI model necessarily requires making a digital copy of any copyrighted work before it can be used to train the model, the same rules that apply to copying copyrighted works should apply to their use in AI models.<br/><br/>The only question then is whether the copying of a copyrighted work in training an AI model will negatively impact the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<br/><br/>While research on the topic would be valuable, it seems intuitively obvious that AI models will reduce the need for the original work of creators such as artists and authors, and so therefore negatively impact the potential market for or value of original copyrighted works.<br/><br/>Regarding &quot;Should the inquiry be whether the outputs of the AI system incorporating the model compete with a particular copyrighted work, the body of works of the same author, or the market for that general class of works?&quot;, the inquiry should be whether the outputs compete with the market for that general class of works, since there&#39;s unlikely to be a cost-effective way to assess a narrower impact.
