As someone who has been writing since I was little and still feel a pull to write to this day, I think the use of AI as a tool by individuals is valid. Any individual who uses AI under a company should be paid well as their knowledge of writing without the technology is still important and there is a learning curve to use this technology.<br/><br/>As long as any works &#39;consumed&#39; (for lack of s better word) by AI for training are significantly transformed by the model and users, that should be fine.<br/><br/>Having thought over how I would feel if my works were used for training, I&#39;m more concerned about outright copies of my works being used, so as long as there is a difference, that&#39;s fine.<br/><br/>If a user requests requests text from AI, they should be limited as per current laws.
