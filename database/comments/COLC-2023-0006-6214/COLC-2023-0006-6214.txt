Even if AI tech creators state that AI doesn&#39;t use existing artworks as collage and &quot;learns like human&quot;, it learns through storaging and analysing copyrighted data. Gained information is used for profit (AI subscriptions, for example). AI is dependent on the database of these works (if this was untrue it wouldn&#39;t be a problem to delete them and refrain from further collection).<br/>AI development on its early stages makes young artists doubt their future careers already, it can lead to desolation in creative fields later in the future. AI technology shouldn&#39;t compete with humans in the area where creators are already underpaid and not protected. Indie artists have no one behind them to fight for their rights. We need help and law support.
