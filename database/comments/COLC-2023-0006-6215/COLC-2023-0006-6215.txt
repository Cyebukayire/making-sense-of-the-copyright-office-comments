Artificial Intelligence has been used broadly to cheat craftsmen out of their craft through theft of trade secrets. This is done without notice of the craftsman, and often time without consent, and has proven to result in massive loss of income for all victimized by this ridiculous technology. It can neither think nor innovate on it&#39;s own, and must subsist off of cannibalizing the works of thousands with no proper compensation offered in exchange. If anything, it is a piracy machine that has gone unchecked for far too long. Regulation should be enforced that allows the victimized craftsmen to see the identity of those who have stolen their work and livelihoods so that they can sue for damages at the very least, but ideally this form of technology should be illegal altogether as it is already piracy. People and companies must not profit off of robbing the very trade that these craftsmen have spent years building up. If we prosecute shoplifters, then we should definitely prosecute the online equivalent of them.
