Training AI using the property of others without their explicit permission is theft. Anyone who creates/who owns/who has rights to their own non-ai assisted writing, photographs, and art ought to have laws protecting them from theft of their property (and in some cases even identity) at the hands of machine learning/AI. At the very least, those who use AI to publish and upload art/writing/photographs should be legally required to in some way mark their &#39;creations&#39; as AI generated. Artists, public figures, and authors are being impersonated, their voices used without compensation, and their likeness used to spread misinformation. It&#39;s not right.
