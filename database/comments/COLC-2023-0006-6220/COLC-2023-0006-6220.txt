I am definitely in favor of generative AI. It is a tool, it&#39;s a tool that will be disruptive of several industries, but we&#39;ll also create new ones. I am firmly in favor of a rule set that allows any public facing art, anything that is intentionally made available to the public to be used in training. Training such services just like it is used by aspiring artists to train themselves. If people do not wish their art to be seen by people or by computers, they shouldn&#39;t put it in places where it can be seen by computers or people.
