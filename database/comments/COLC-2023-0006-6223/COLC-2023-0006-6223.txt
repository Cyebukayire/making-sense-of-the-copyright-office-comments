AI is being pushed forward very quickly for a culture and economy that is not ready for it: I believe it quickly needs much more regulation to protect artists, and that there should be an emphasis on obtaining consent from and compensation for artists in the future before sampling their talents to develop AI, and punishments for AI developers who don&#39;t follow these rules and take advantage of other people&#39;s work without paying. I also firmly believe that any work made using an AI should not be protected by copyright law, due to the fact that the AI is both Not a Person and because its use by people is in essence a form of plagiarism. As it currently stands, AI is unregulated and it is already being used to hurt artists across industries.
