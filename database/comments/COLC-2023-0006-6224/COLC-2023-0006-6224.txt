I am an artist and animator working Los Angeles, the way I have seen this image generation models being used to steal the work of my fellow artist is heart breaking. This is another example of silicon valley&#39;s &quot;move fast and break things&quot; mentality. These image generators took thousands of pieces of art made by artist seeking to display or sell their work with out our consent. It seems that as long as you are a big company you can violate the rights of individuals (this cause copy right) and be rewarded with venture capital funds and hope the government regulators never catch up. What is the point of copyright as a concept if I and others can not enforce it in any meaningful way. It seems only music labels and Getty images are taken serious when this issue come up. Who is in the right and who is in the wrong seems fairly obvious to me, this technology must be regulated to protect everyday people&#39;s craft and livelihood.
