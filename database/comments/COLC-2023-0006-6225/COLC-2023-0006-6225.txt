As an aspiring artist from a foreign country, I honestly feel like there&#39;s not much I can do about the dire situation artists find themselves in regarding generative AI, which indeed poses a dire panorama for anyone hoping to provide for themselves, and contribute to the economy, with their imagination and hard work to express it as a starting point... It goes from loss of jobs to machines fed with the very work of those being replaced, to feelings of suicide and deep depression for most artists that now see their livelihoods and aspirations being threatened, as I&#39;m sure many have reported already.<br/><br/>I usually just take a passive role in this whole situation, and I limit myself to just paying attention to the public discourse and to the news on this matter... Well, I do hereby admit that the news I&#39;m looking forward the most are the ones in which, hopefully, the United States Goverment puts a stop to the way the tech companies involved in any capacity with genAI have been carrying themselves so far, and imposes regulations that, yes, will allow these companies to help with human and technological advancement, but without harming millions of people&#39;s livelihoods permanently to do so, specially if the possible victims of deepfakes generated by AI are considered. The USA have immense power regarding regulations to new technologies, capable of setting the trend and the standard for other countries and regions, and I&#39;m actually praying that the fair ones are being applied to the genAI side of the tech industry soon. Writing today to say this, is the way I can help regarding this situation.
