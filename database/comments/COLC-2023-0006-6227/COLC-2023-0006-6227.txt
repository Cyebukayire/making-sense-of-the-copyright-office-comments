Hello members of the U.S Copyright Office. I&#39;m just a Manager of an Office Depot in Texas as stated in the questionnaire. I&#39;m also a digital artist that enjoys to draw cute things whenever I have time. I&#39;m not going to waste any of our time by stating right away that AI should not under any means be protected by copyright, much less used for any artistic endeavors of any kind and should be punished and removed from analysing and basically art and writing that has been created by actual humans. I&#39;m not just saying this because I draw. Believe me, my art is far from popular much less breathtaking. The reason is quite simple that any child with enough common sense could even understand. It cannot replace nor imitate the thoughts, passion, intricacies, much less the efforts that humans have been putting into this craft that has been with us since before Man could formulate a single thought. Sure, AI can help out in other ways that might seem impossible under today&#39;s technologies. But that doesn&#39;t make it into the next Google in terms of Artistic endeavors. I&#39;m sure many companies can find more tech appropriate uses for AI. But let&#39;s agree that Art should be left to Humans, not a computer that is simply reusing the blood, sweat and tears real artists, and writers have gone through. Please, take the time to actually read all the responses other than my own and make the correct decision. You will see that the answer isn&#39;t as hard to find as you believe it to be. Thank you for your time.
