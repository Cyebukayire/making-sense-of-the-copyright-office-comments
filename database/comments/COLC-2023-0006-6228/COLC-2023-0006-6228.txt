This comment will be mainly focus on Generstive AI. As an artist and a human with rights to the protection of data that I own, how can tech companies be waivered to train their monetised AI products on the content of individuals without consent, credit or compensation? They cannot, and should not be allowed to do this. The works of artists globally are being scraped at a criminally high level to develop products for monetisation that seek to replace us by exploiting our existing work without any compensation. We all have a right as to how our works should be used and for it to be stolen and implemented in the development of a mass image generator only for big companies to take advantage more to expand unbelievable profit margins is ludicrious. <br/><br/>Such Generative AI programs are also being used to create obscene images, such as child porn or pornographic images of REAL people. They have a right to not be depicted in such a way without their consent as do the owners of the images in Generative AI training data sets have in wanting nothing to do with the development of such harm. The voices of people with only a small amount of recordings can be used to say virtually anything a user of Generative AI wants at a scarily easy level. Actors have had their whole bodies scanned without agreeing to the fact that companies will now use their scanned likeness in pertuity whenever they feel like it without royalties to the respective owners. People have a right to determine how their exact likeness, in both voice and body, say and perform in the public space and should not be abled to be abused and manipulated in anyway without consent by any lowly individual or multi-billion dollar company. What an absolute disgrace that a person&#39;s likeness can be exploited to perform acts not actually done by the real person without intervention from legislation to prevent this. Imagine the harms and misinformation this will bring about when people can be made to say, perform, or visually depicted by malicious users. Within a year of the popularisation of Generative AI there has already been the takedown of a Generative AI child porn ring.<br/><br/>We have already seen precedent cases that should protect individual&#39;s data from AI training such as with regards to Amazon&#39;s Alexa recording and storing people&#39;s voices to better train Alexa&#39;s accuracy in responses and with the case of Napster allowing for the unencumbered transfer of data without the consent of individuals on a global scale.<br/><br/>The people are not anti-AI, we are against AI that seeks to exploit people&#39;s labour and data for profits and malicious purposes. We have already had AI around in smaller scales such as in hardware to increase their performance, in social media algorithms to generate curated feeds, or in scientific research to make breakthroughs in the development of medicine. It is not lost on us that AI has already been a part of our lives for a long time. We are against AI that in its development has resulted in the theft of people&#39;s labour and likeness, to be used by bad faith actors in violation of people&#39;s consent, and in its nature creates unfair competition in the job market.<br/><br/>Opt-Out policies do not work. Imagine the ridiculousness of the matter that when people steal your belongings you must go and ask for them to give it back and tell them not to steal anymore from them. This is the internet. People can still take your content and input them into Generative AI training data, claiming to be its rightful owner that gives consent. We already see this in Adobe Firefly which claims to only train on data in its Stock Image library to which technically they have the right to use in the development of its Generative AI program (in a scummy way but a story for another day), yet bad faith actors have uploaded the images of other artists into the library and is why AI generated images in the style or likeness of an artist, who did not consent to be part of the Stock Image library, can be created. Generative AI is a reason why actors and writers are on strike and if visual artists had a union, we would be too.<br/><br/>Some final thoughts on Generative AI. Copyright and Personal Data laws should already protect us from the rise of aggressive AI training policies. Arguments in support of the ideas that &quot;Generative AI learns like humans&quot; is ludicrous because the very fact that such programs can be created with math and algorithms should say as much. I would be very wary of the humanisation and idolisation of AI programs that promoters are currently doing not because I am worried about a Terminator uprising, but because of the perseverance and exacerbation of current exploitative practices allowed to reign free. Lastly, there must be a better balance of speakers in AI debates, lest it be just a promotion panel for AI.<br/><br/>Thank you very much for reaching out to the people to give their inputs on this sensitive matter and I hope you will take the time to read through all comments thoroughly.
