The training databases AI pulls from are scraped regardless of permission from the original owners. Because these models just pull directly from the materials scraped without consent there is nothing transformative about it, just exploitative. These companies are relying on data they do not own to hurt the people who created it, and should receive no protection from the law as long as their databases are built on stolen work.
