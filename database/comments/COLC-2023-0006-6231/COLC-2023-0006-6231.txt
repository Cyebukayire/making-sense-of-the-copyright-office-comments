AI, especially generative AI, is simply mass theft from creatives, professional and amateur, in many fields. Their models wouldn&#39;t exist and wouldn&#39;t function without the scraping of the intellectual property of hundreds of thousands of people, groups, etc.<br/>Then, to add insult to injury, the result is used to compete in the same market with the people who have had their art, voices, writing, etc. stolen who are unable to keep up with a machine that never needs rest or food.<br/>If I were to go copy the source code of a program that is someone else&#39;s intellectual property, ran it through a code obfuscater, then tried to copyright it myself, my application would, rightly, be denied. So why should a program, doing functionally the same thing on mass scale, be able to copyright its output?<br/>Allowing copyrights on AI output would simply send the message that theft and exploitation is completely fine as long as you do it on an enormous scale.
