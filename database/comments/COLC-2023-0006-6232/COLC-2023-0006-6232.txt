As an independent artist that specializes in animation and comic work I find generative AI as a threat to not only my job but my copyright holdings. Its use by &quot;learning&quot; using the works of people who have honed their craft for decades by people who are too lazy to learn a skill is nothing short of insulting. Corporate studios are intending to steal the works of others and each other. It will inevitably lead to a copyright war that will see no winners beyond the largest CEOs. <br/><br/>Please do not let AI become copyrightable and please allow those who have had their work stolen against their wishes to sue for damages.
