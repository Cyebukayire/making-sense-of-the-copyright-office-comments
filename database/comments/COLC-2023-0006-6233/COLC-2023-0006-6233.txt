Ai art destroys my ability to exist, others think I am worthless and will let me die.<br/>Ai steals from artists and does not learn mechanical exercises, it cannot work without power. We can work without power. We can draw on paper, paint with paint and sculpt with our fingers, cut with precision that may have unique artistic touches.<br/>We come up with unique ideas that can go on endlessly while ai stagnates when artists don&#39;t post. Without real artists it wouldn&#39;t have anything to create from.<br/><br/>It doesn&#39;t have imagination or anything, I hate tracing and copying as well but at least they put pencil to paper and do something, others type less than what I&#39;ve written here to get a &quot;result&quot; they don&#39;t put in fine details and the image just looks &quot;okay&quot; from a glance but when you investigate there are always glaring issues no matter how much they claim to do with it, no matter how HQ it looks...there are issues worse than that of already see with human artists as is.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve always felt humanity stopped putting details in their art as much to be lazy, to automate everything which causes stagnation and cancer (literally) we need to create as well, to keep us alive.<br/><br/>Creations are from our very being, our core light. It is what builds us, everyone can make a unique creation from a small source of ideas, why else is the cosmos so varied and beautiful, the universe is the best artist after all.<br/><br/>Please don&#39;t let artists die, I myself have nothing else but art, I can&#39;t do anything else I can only make stuff out of my imagination.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve been so hurt over the ai, everyone has and it will only get worse.<br/><br/>I can show examples of my work and how close up of you zoom in on AI it turns to mush most of the time. No matter how much you zoom into mine it is crisp and clear of what things are.<br/><br/>I layer, without weird jagged pixel lines. I can add deeply unique detail and meaning to each piece nobody will see unless intended, as a way to prove I made things for one.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve made art since I was a little girl, I have always wanted to make it a career but always had severe anxiety issues. I am losing all hope. I can&#39;t connect with anyone anymore.<br/><br/>Nobody wants to talk about art and critique and have fun over how someone created it, what inspired them as a whole and on the tiny inflections and detailing.<br/><br/>To water sand, to look closely in to the detailing, to paint each tiny thing and mold things, to get messy at times or stay clean otherwise while on the go.<br/><br/>Art is supposed to be endless and always growing, not be a stagnation of noise.<br/><br/>All ai art is is noise, noise layering until it becomes a picture it copied from an image already made in time. It just copies premade light.<br/><br/>It adds noise very subtly as other images it uses, like if you drew a squiggle it would generate noise to blend in the image.<br/><br/>Artists add every little line, think out every detail, the eye shape, pupil shape, skin, body, pose, style, amount of everything, anything is extremely intimately their own even if inspired by others.<br/><br/>I prefer a scribbled jagged drawing with crayon over a huge ai generated image that looks &quot;good&quot; this goes for the best ai seen, for the ones who use those &quot;customization&quot; programs.<br/><br/>All ai is, is a dress up generator game, or a character creator in a videogame before you play the game, that is AT MOST on the most &quot;intricate&quot; ai.<br/><br/>They claim not to steal but they do, how can anyone deny at this point. Artists would attack tracers and copiers but one&#39;s doing worse are supposedly innocent???<br/><br/>I hate this so much. Also with projections, art is what creates reality as it is, we wouldn&#39;t have schematics that make sense.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but need to do other things for now, my name is Cristina Krystal Melgosa and I go by Krystami online. I&#39;ll add what I can but please stop the AI, it isn&#39;t good for ANYONE. It is destroying part of the &quot;trinity&quot; of media. We need art to make other forms of media, it is the basis of all and if you don&#39;t have unique outcomes for the same ideas, what use is there for it? It can only create from the exact same things as before, not even a slight difference.<br/><br/>It&#39;s disappointing, it makes me terribly sad and how are others gonna make art in the future if the sun or something kills all power? What if we just had pencils and paper again for a decade or so? What do we do then if no one knows how to make art anymore. If there are no resources to see and only drowned out by mush that is copying all the best. Causing suicides to skyrocket. Does anyone care about anyone other than themselves? It seems those who are most selfless, aka the artists get stepped on and tossed aside the most.<br/>Why is that when we are literally the foundation for all things that exist. Buildings, meals, billboards,roads, boats, toys, adult items, shows, clothing, trinkets, jewelry, etc. EVERYTHING.<br/><br/>Why when artists are the ones who are most likely disabled and unable to work other jobs one way or another....it hurts, please stop this pain....please
