All Current AI models function by consuming copyright protected works without the creators&rsquo; consent or knowledge, and function as a product that critically endangers the livelihood of the creators it takes from. This should be unacceptable. AI companies should build Generative AI models using only public domain art, or art that has been licensed to them for training purposes. Current models that do not oblige by this should be destroyed or used strictly for non-commercial, non-creative purposes, such as scientific research.
