1.Please remember why copyright law came into existence.<br/><br/>Copyright law arose because of a new technology called printing.<br/><br/>When mass reproduction occurred, it was created to respect the rights of the original author.<br/>It was a law ahead of its time, and it is the reason why the Copyright Office exists today.<br/>Could printing (reproduction technology) have been prevented?<br/>Since we couldn&#39;t stop it, copyright law came into existence.<br/>With the advent of new technology, copyright has emerged to respect the original author.<br/>Likewise, a new technology, AI, has been released.<br/>Loosening AI regulations that ignore the property of original authors and introducing immunity laws are<br/>Report of decline in property rights<br/>It is a regression in law, politics and society.<br/>It&#39;s not progress. This was in the Middle Ages, when there was no copyright law.<br/>It is no different from regressing.<br/>Please protect the original author.<br/><br/>2.The market will be destroyed.<br/><br/>Copyright does not only protect one field.<br/>If immunity is granted, numerous fields and industries will suffer.<br/><br/>Only the AI ​​field makes profit and money, while other fields are exploited.<br/>AI engineers have accumulated through the hard work of creators in each field.<br/>Their faces, voices, and work styles.<br/>They put it in AI and sell it as they please.<br/><br/>Where does that value come from?<br/>Was it created by AI developers?<br/>Was it created by AI users?<br/><br/>It is the hard work of the creators.<br/>Think of an unknown singer.<br/>He worked hard for 10 years to become famous and become popular.<br/>However, due to copyright exemption and technological advancement, AI companies<br/>Steal his voice and skills<br/>I&#39;m trying to use it without any value.<br/>Ten years of his life was stolen.<br/><br/>They use the value they created by asking AI to use it.<br/>Trying to replace them and get rid of them<br/>How cruel is this?<br/><br/>This is theft.<br/>Is it okay to steal because of technological advancement?<br/>In the future, if AI kills or steals people,<br/>Would it be okay?<br/><br/>Even if people try to imitate, their ability is limited, and only a few people can imitate perfectly. If AI steals<br/>It creates more than hundreds of millions of people and lowers its value.<br/>And it makes it worse than free.<br/><br/>3.The meaning of copyright disappears and creates a barbaric market.<br/><br/>If unauthorized use of copyright is permitted, companies take it from individuals with impunity.<br/>There will be a war of takeover between us.<br/>In places like Musk&#39;s Twitter, sites are closed to each other to avoid disclosing data.<br/><br/>And this will collapse the market for paying for data.<br/>It will crash the market<br/><br/>Who needs to request anything? Which artist&#39;s painting style would I like to have?<br/>In the past, I asked him to<br/>Now, his drawings are taught to AI.<br/>You don&#39;t have to pay for it, or someone else takes the money and steals it.<br/>The artist is deprived of the money he is due.<br/>This is barbaric.<br/><br/>4.Copyright is an intellectual property right.<br/>Because the country wants to grow the AI ​​industry, copyright fees are expensive.<br/>Is it okay to grant immunity? Since when can the state freely dispose of an individual&#39;s property at will?<br/>In that case, do not provide compensation or wages when developing for the sake of the country. If it&#39;s expensive, should it be free? If it&#39;s expensive, is it okay to steal it?<br/>If the government allows this, it is theft disguised as technological advancement.<br/><br/>Please do not arbitrarily sell the creators&#39; property. for free<br/><br/>5.The Internet becomes closed<br/>It becomes a closed society that is afraid of disclosing information.<br/><br/>Musk&#39;s<br/>Take a look at Twitter.<br/><br/>Each company wants to use other people&#39;s data for free.<br/>I don&#39;t want my data to be stolen<br/>I want to limit the number of views and close the data.<br/><br/>Also, data that is someone else&#39;s effort is free and<br/>To feed data to AI<br/>Excessive crawling is causing huge traffic costs.<br/><br/>If the Copyright Disclaimer is maintained, people will<br/>You will be reluctant to disclose information.<br/><br/>It is also a problem that the internet is polluted with fake data using AI.<br/>I am concerned that it may be used without permission due to copyright exemption.<br/>There is a problem of hiding data from each other and preventing development.<br/><br/>Even AI users have AI works that are not protected by law.<br/>I hide it because I&#39;m afraid it might be stolen.<br/><br/>This degenerates society.<br/>Please protect intellectual property, which is the property of creators.<br/><br/>This is also the country&#39;s property.<br/>The meaning of copyright will disappear.<br/>Industries such as Hollywood/Disney are protected by copyright.<br/> Using exemption from overseas<br/>Their materials will be used without permission and may infringe upon them.<br/><br/>At first, they took away personal things.<br/>After that, companies will take it from each other.<br/>Using Copyright Disclaimer
