 believe that an author that uses AI the correct way should be allowed to copyright their book/etc. The right way is working with the AI and letting it know exactly what you want and that cannot be done by just giving it a prompt and letting it produce it all from Chapter 1 till Chapter 50.  It will take a human interaction with it as you will need to provide instructions on what you want for each scene. I have experimented with it, and without my input and instructions, you get a jumbled-up mess.  If you work with you step by step, scene by scene, then the AI follows your instructions, and you come out with a book that is fit for someone to read.
