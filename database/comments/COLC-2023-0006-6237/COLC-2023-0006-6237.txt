Artificial Intelligence is not a creator of any original work. If a machine process requires other people work and processes to slice apart and put it back together it is not creating, only replicating.<br/>Machines and AI do not place building blocks to build complex shapes. You give an AI a paint brush that is can make strokes with, it will not create original artwork. It may mimic and slice but will not make anything original or new.
