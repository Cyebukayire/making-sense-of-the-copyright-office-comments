Generative AI is the biggest copyright infringement of the modern age. It has been trained on intellectual property without the consent or compensation of the artists or companies who own the intellectual property. The government needs to regulate these companies and fine them for stealing data illegally. This reminds me of Napster and Limewire in the late 90&rsquo;s/early 2000&rsquo;s. Those companies were pirating music and these generative ai companies are pirating images to train their machine learning. There is a world where AI is regulated and trained on licensed material only. In that economy the artists would be compensated.
