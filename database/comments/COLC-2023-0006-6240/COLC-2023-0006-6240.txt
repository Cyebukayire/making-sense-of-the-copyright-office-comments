The idea that generative AI infringes on copyright is ridiculous. If this were the case, all artists who learn by copying masterwork and develop styles based on what came before would be equally in violation of copyright. This would be a very dangerous precedent, particularly since AI will soon be very capable of discerning the source of styles that artists, writers, etc might believe to be their own but are actually acquired by learning via mimicry. This is a terrible idea.
