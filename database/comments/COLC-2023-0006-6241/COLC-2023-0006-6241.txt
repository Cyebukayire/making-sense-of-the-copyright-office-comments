Title: Copyrighted Material in Training Data<br/><br/>Comment:<br/>I am going to offer a few of my points of reasoning and explain why copyrighted material in training data should not be restricted. Note, I may cover multiple perspectives and each point of reasoning can be treated on an individual basis.<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful and steerable by the user, it will become easier for users to recreate copyrighted works from the training data regardless of the material being used in training. Combine user steerable models with non-copyrighted materials, and most works inspired from that material could be reproduced. In this situation I echo the sentiment that AI + the user should not be treated the same as completely autonomous AI. The more control over AI the user has, the less it should be about how the AI is trained and more it should be about how the user uses the content created.<br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Outside of completely automated AI, usage of generated work is handled by the user. Clarification: after a work is generated a user decides how they want to use the generated work.<br/><br/>* Important: generated works may not be easily identified as copyrighted if unintentionally reproduced. It may not be possible to avoid a certain percentage of mistakes (both human and AI), a policy should be crafted that anticipates this possibility.<br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>It is worth noting that if AI generated work were to be allowed copyright, it would be almost impossible to both protect generated work and prevent that work from being used in training. Especially since that work would most likely be used to improve the previous model.<br/><br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Open source or early models trained on copyrighted material may transfer some of their knowledge to newer models. There already exist models trained on copyrighted material, both intentional and not, so it stands to reason that some of this knowledge may unknowingly be transferred to newer models. Reasoning: human error &ndash; it is very easy to make an error when a system is too vast to reasonably verify all copyrighted material has been removed; news &ndash; when using generative AI in the news, copyright usage in training becomes further complicated.<br/><br/>My personal assessment is that the focus of regulations on generative AI, copyright in this case, should mainly focus on how generated work is used rather than how it is made. The way in which it is made is informed by how it is used. If we focus on situations that inform its usage, we can better set policies that will improve AI systems for everyone. AI is informed by example, so let&#39;s use that to our advantage in this circumstance.<br/><br/>Title: Labeling AI Content<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Labeling AI content is not feasible considering multiple factors and obstacles. For example, using AI to label AI generated content will not always label correctly. The way in which such a system works is by identifying examples of AI generated content, which means this system is not capable of telling you if a user is AI, but instead telling you if a user is similar to AI. It is not impossible for a user to create an original work, and then that work to be labeled as AI generated. This can be &ldquo;mitigated&rdquo; through approaches such as reinforcement learning (taking problematic outputs and using them to inform further training), but these systems are not infallible.<br/><br/>My personal view is that AI content should not be strictly labeled. Instead, we should focus on labeling content that is factually verifiable regardless of AI generation. This could be to the extent that anyone who wants to make their work standout as &ldquo;verified&rdquo; could do so via review of a third-party, past reliability and following, and/or to the discretion of the individual viewing the content.<br/>
