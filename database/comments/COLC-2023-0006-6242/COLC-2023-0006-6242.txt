Artificial Intelligence and all works of art, including but not limited to: scripts, writing, videos, digital paintings, and audio, should not be considered or protected by copyright laws, as material fed into AI is typically ripped from already copyrighting media. For the same reasons works of fanfiction cannot be copyrighted, until something is in the public domain its source material should not be used to create newly copyrighted works, especially when they are not &quot;created,&quot; they are generated by an inhuman, insentient algorithm, which should need no copyright rights as it cannot be impacted by the commercial use of its work.
