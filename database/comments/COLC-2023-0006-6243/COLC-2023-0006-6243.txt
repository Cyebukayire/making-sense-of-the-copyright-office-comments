Hello, I am a college student living in Korea. The sentence may be strange because I used an English translator.<br/>Generative AI learns many Internet works illegally, and it has the immunity of AI learning. But in fact, it&#39;s humans who are learning AI, and it&#39;s also benefiting. The works used for learning are taken at random without any source or compensation for being used for AI, and only benefit the person who uses it.<br/>It&#39;s like the inhumane act of a shopping mall putting all the luxury goods and products in a shopping cart, taking them home, scanning all the products, and getting a refund.<br/>It is also contradictory to not hold any human or business accountable for it. AI is a tool. Misuse of the tool is entirely the responsibility of the person who used it.<br/>Should I hold the chainsaw maker accountable for the accident caused by the chainsaw? However, if that is impossible, it is also a way to shift the blame to the production company.<br/>I am drawing as a hobby.<br/>And as soon as writers speak against AI, they are attacked by cyberbullying. There is no way to get copyright protection. There&#39;s a constant stream of extortion, and there&#39;s thousands of pieces of data coming out every minute that&#39;s just pretty, copyrighted digital trash.<br/>It also doesn&#39;t reveal whether or not Chat GPT was used for fake information, fake news, college assignments, exams, etc. This is unfair competition, just cheating. Regulations and policies are urgently needed as soon as possible.<br/>It&#39;s not a backlash against automation, it&#39;s a thief&#39;s psychology, like the direction of development that&#39;s close to personal property infringement and the creative economy of thieves who want to benefit from it.
