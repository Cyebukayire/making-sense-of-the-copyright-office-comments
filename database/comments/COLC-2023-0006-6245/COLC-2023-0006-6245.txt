Well, I hate AI. I spent so long learning to draw digitally, only for someone with no experience to type in a few words and generate an abomination with horrible shading and mismatched limbs. And then I tried writing stories in high school and took writing classes, only for someone to type in a few words and generate an emotionless short story with no plot. My friends are joining dying fields. They want to be animators and journalists. Robots are taking our fine arts jobs, while we have to do the remaining manual labor jobs. I should not be 20 years old in a world where robots are free to have fun and the humans work until they die. Regulate these robots, please. I&#39;m tired of them.
