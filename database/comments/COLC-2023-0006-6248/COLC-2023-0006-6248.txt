As an author of speculative fiction, I recognize the transformative power of technology, particularly artificial intelligence, in shaping our future. With this in mind, I wholeheartedly endorse the training of AI on my novels. I view this not as an exploitation of my work, but rather as a continuation of its impact, extending its relevance into realms we are only beginning to understand.<br/><br/>Life is finite, and even the most celebrated literature often has a limited lifespan in the collective human memory. The true value of any creative endeavor lies in its ability to inspire, provoke thought, and catalyze change. By allowing AI to train on my works, I am effectively immortalizing them in the digital DNA of a technology that has the potential to reshape society for generations to come.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I am a firm believer in the development of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) as a leap forward for humanity. By contributing to its training data, my work becomes a part of that larger endeavor to create intelligent systems capable of broad, adaptable, and nuanced thought. In essence, I am not just an author but a willing participant in one of the most exciting scientific and philosophical adventures of our time.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I enthusiastically support the use of my writing in AI training programs, and I am optimistic about the immense possibilities this opens up for the future of both literature and technology.
