Hello, I&#39;m a designer and I&#39;m concerned about AI&#39;s effect on the livelihoods of those in creative industries. AI technology has already been used to scrape data from non-consenting workers. It&#39;s a threat to copyright as well as the well-being of those who work in creative fields. Regulation is necessary to protect people and property from AI.
