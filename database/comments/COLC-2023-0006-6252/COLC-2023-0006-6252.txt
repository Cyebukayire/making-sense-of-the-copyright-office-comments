AI generative &quot;art&quot; preys upon the work of others and is pretty much theft. AI can&#39;t &quot;take inspiration&quot; or be creative because it is a database fed largely stolen art without the consent of the artist who created it. People with either very little skill or imagination of their own type in an idea they have that already applies to thousands of other art and mashes them together (often putting  out an image barely changed from an original piece). So the idea of calling the work transformative is laughable.<br/><br/> Also it absolutely preys on artists, particularly artists who can&#39;t afford to fight tooth and nail financially to protect all their work. And as largely demonstrated by the recent SAG-AFTRA/writers guild strikes, it threatens the livelihoods of all kinds of people because of greedy individuals who know that if it were allowed to be implemented, they would fire everyone one and use these programs the spit out work that is essentially a xerox of a xerox of other existing work from people who worked hard on their creation and was likely underpaid. <br/><br/>The only people who benefit from the ai created &quot;art&quot; are greedy people looking to profit on a collaged piece of stolen and cut up work and lazy individuals who have the audacity to claim their typing in of prompts is even remotely the same as the act of creating something. Frankly it&#39;s frightening and makes me honestly a little disgusted at people&#39;s ability to rationalize why AI &#39;needs&#39; to be a artform when it comes at the perpetual expense of others.
