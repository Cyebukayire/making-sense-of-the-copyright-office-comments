AI should NOT be copyrightable under any circumstances. The nature of AI inherently infringes on copyright- by pulling from existing work, AI can risk copying or reusing work that is already protected under copyright law. AI training models and processes by nature must reference existing works, and in doing so will inadvertently infringe already existing copyrights. <br/><br/>I would be in support of AI generated work ONLY IF it were possible for AI to have a legitimate form or authorship or creative identity in the work - however, AI as it exists now merely references and collages already existing works rather than synthesizing completely new works. AI in itself is not yet advanced enough to have a creative &#39;identity&#39; or &#39;sensibility&#39;. AI models are not yet &#39;individuals&#39; that can create works but rather simple tools that others use to imitate and collage already existing works. As of now, AI work is simply a shortcut that bypasses human authorship, creative input, and effort. Not only do AI training models infringe on existing copyrighted works, but given that many works can be output at a rapid pace for a low (or no) price, AI work is often used to completely bypass human work. This is a great concern for myself and much of the creative community, as AI works can be used to forego human input entirely.<br/>In my perspective as an artist, writer, and professional game developer, I am already seeing the repercussions of AI works in these industries. They are replacing human creatives and outputting shoddy imitative work that lacks human authorship and identity. Rather than compensating the skilled professional creatives whose livelihoods depend on their work, many companies are already resorting to AI work, risking copyright infringement for the sake of saving money. This is extremely worrisome to me and the rest of the creative community, and yet another reason to prevent AI works from retaining copyright.<br/><br/>Regarding the line where a human has &#39;sufficient control over the technology&#39; to be considered an act of human authorship rather than AI authorship, the method of &#39;creation&#39; must be considered - how exactly does typing a prompt create a piece of art? Could the human feasibly generate the art without the technology, given enough time/non-machine resources to do so? From an artistic standpoint, could the human reasonably paint the brushstrokes, determine the composition, or understand the lighting themselves? Is typing in a prompt equivalent to taking a brush to canvas?<br/> All of these elements of &#39;authorship&#39; MUST be considered when determining whether AI works can be copyrighted.
