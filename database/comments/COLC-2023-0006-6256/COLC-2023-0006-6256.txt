As an illustrator I do illustrations with the purpose of making a living, I post illustrations to promote my work, and I did not give any of the AI companies nor the data scrappers the permission to make industrial use of my work and information to create a machine wich goal is to replace illustrators like myself, companies didn&#39;t gave me money for the artwork I created to make a living yet they are profiting millioms of dollars of it. At the end of this industrial chain of stealing and insulting the work and life of artists like myself is the consumer, someone who pays the machine to generate images, songs, scripts, etc. That person&#39;s role hasn&#39;t changed, that person is not a creator, instead is a client. In regards of AI this is similar, they are asking a machine to take the work of artists and spit something similar, so in fact they are even further away from the cration process, the copyright in that case should go to the creators of the original assets the machine used to generate the &#39;artwork&#39;, but since it steals from millions of artist&#39;s it would be nearly impossible. Giving copyright protection to an AI generate artwork would be  to legitimate stealing the work of an artist. Copyright should not be given to AI artworks
