AI works (writing, art, etc) should be considered plagiarism due to the fact it uses other people&#39;s works (and sometimes their name) without giving credit to the original artist.  These artists get no money for their style and names being put out into the world like this, and they should not be considered legal.  They are trained using art theft.
