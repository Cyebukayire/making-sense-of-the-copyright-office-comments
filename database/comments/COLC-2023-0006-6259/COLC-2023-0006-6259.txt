AI artworks shouldn&#39;t be considered IP or have the ability to be copyrighted, it is at the end of the day simply a permutation and combinations of other people&#39;s artworks, too the point it has literally ended up making direct copies of some artist&#39;s work. Furthermore like any other artists using other people&#39;s work, needs to license and credit it based on their contracts, their should be a licensing fee owed to the original artist and credit requirement due to the the original artist, this should apply to all forms of artist, whether visual, performative (extra actors in film and TV being recreated by AI) and so on, if AI used to produce something like this.
