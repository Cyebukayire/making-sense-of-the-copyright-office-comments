Please make the way that generative AI works more clear to the layman. I believe that IP infringement and copyright laws are being violated by this technology. The lack of consent by all, not only artists, but anyone that has uploaded their images or content anywhere on the internet in a public setting, that then is used to train AI is highly unethical, and inequitable. Generative AI and Large Language Models need to be regulated, defined and legislated to protect everyone from accidental misuse all the way to theft and abuse.
