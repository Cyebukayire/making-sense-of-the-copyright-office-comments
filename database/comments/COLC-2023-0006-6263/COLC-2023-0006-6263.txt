It is important to take into context how generative AI is being used NOW. How it is impacting us NOW will have a domino effect. Now, artist, writers, musicians, actors and voice actors are being replaced, or their worked used to train without consent. You can easily see this evidenced on social media and the reasons strikes are happening currently. AI can be a fantastic tool, but it should not replace humans nor should it steal from other&#39;s labor of love. &#39;For profit&#39; mindsets sadly forget that the process of creativty is just as important as the final product. If an AI needs training, make sure artists, musicians and writer have given consent and are fairly compensated (such as a license or royalties). If an AI replicates an actor&#39;s image or voice, they also need protections and fair compensation. It is immoral and soulless to exploit, pay them as little as possible and yet continiue to milk their image or voice for self-gain and profit. What will become of the humans chewed up and spat out by this alarming but very possible future? How will this effect unemployment percentages in the future? How will people secure a living wage? Isn&#39;t it already very difficult for most of us (and it is because of circumstance, not laziness)? shouldn&#39;t AI make everyone&#39;s life easier and not something to dread?
