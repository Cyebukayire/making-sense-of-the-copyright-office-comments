I am against the use of AI as it is unethical and takes jobs from hardworking artists, writers, animators, voice actors, singers, and soon live action actors without their consent. Instead of replacing hardworking creatives with mindless robots, we should be working towards protecting their work and setting workplace regulations, standards and paying them a living wage.
