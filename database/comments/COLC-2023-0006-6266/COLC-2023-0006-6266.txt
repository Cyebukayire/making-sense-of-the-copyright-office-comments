AI art is, full stop, not art, it is merely rote copying. A big problem is it tends to rip from way, way too many sources that are already copyrighted, and is ultimately inferior to what a good, real artist already does--on top of taking away money from those real artists when someone thinks the AI art is &#39;good enough.&#39; It never is actually &#39;good enough,&#39; with tons of tiny little errors that creep in because an AI is not intuitive, it can only process raw data and give best guesses. At absolute best, this thing is good ONLY for reference pics that real, paid artists can then improve on. Not for serious commercial use.
