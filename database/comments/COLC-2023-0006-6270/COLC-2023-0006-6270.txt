I myself use Stable Diffusion to generate art, but don&#39;t share it. I feel that if an AI model was trained on copyrighted works, and can replicate said artist&#39;s style, then that infringes on said artist&#39;s copyright. However, if someone trains their own model with their own works, and can prove that by providing the training data, then the person who trained the model retains copyright. While AI art is good, its nowhere near perfect, and it has uses. When it comes to AI for generating text, like ChatGPT, with it being trained on data scraped from various sites like reddit and other forms, that should be fine as the data was public already. I&#39;d say that if the work is creative in any way, if the work wasnt released into public domain or a creative commons license, then the creator of the work should retain copyright if it is similar enough to that creator&#39;s works. If the data all is under creative commons license, then all the results of the AI should be under a license compatible to the original license of the works. If it were all public domain data that was used, then the results should either be copyright of the person who generated the work, or in public domain as well.
