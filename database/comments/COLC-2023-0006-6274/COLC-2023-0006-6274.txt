To me generative AI is a complicated matter. The purpose of the survey can conclude, that is the case. Where, on first glance, one can see that models that have been trained have been done, so unfairly to those with the content that it was trained on. On a shallow look, seemingly that it&#39;s generating content that should be considered a copyright offense. However, where I fall into this look onto the technology, are icy for what it is, and it being more complex than an initial glance.<br/><br/>If you were to make a definition of what could been or regulate the training of generative models, it would be hard to discern the difference between a computer learning to create versus a human. Although the method of learning and training is vastly different, the effectively perform the same function.<br/><br/>If, for example, we take image generation AI. One can see that it learns at the same technique as a human. There are many models and types that have different methods, such as the most common, the diffusion model, which will create an image by removing noise. And a human needing to use a physical barrier, such as an arm, or any other chosen appendage learned by physical contact to the page and growth of the muscles and neurons. However, both of these AI and human learn from studying what is around them both real and created art. Everything within the training is equal to what a human uses to learn.<br/><br/>But overall the concern is valid. What once was the field of human training can be done by a complete novice in a matter of seconds. I wish I had a solid answer for you one that will lead you into a yay or nay, on whether or not to put restriction law or regulation against this. But as someone who has been using the AI generation, for sometime, I can tell you, it&#39;s not a hindrance to artist, but can be used as a tool. It&#39;s helped me on countless projects, such as create and textures for 3D scene, character concepts, model sheet references, graphic design assets for packaging, and more.<br/><br/>Overall, I personally do not see it as a barrier or destruction to the freelance artist, or even the professionally hired. But just as adobe Photoshop was met with anguish, they both can become a valuable tool to those that perform the talent. For mini, it may be a quick and cheap solution to get something that they need, but as for in this current moment, I still feel that the human artist is more valued. Of course, only time will tell on the level of skill that this technology can provide.<br/><br/>Will it be something where you can literally generate anything with perfect professionalism to the craft or will you still need human hands to give you something worthwhile.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I feel that the structure in which it obtains its information to train on, is the key factor to consider here. I do not believe the models or the use of such a model should be prohibited by any means. But perhaps a generalized defaulted opt out of training restricting the owners of the AI to train only on what has been given to them by the individual that created it would be the best practice. This will leave the individuals and corporations with the ability to come up with a reasonable contribution for the data.
