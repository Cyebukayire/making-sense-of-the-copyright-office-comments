Ai &quot;art&quot; is literally theft. No one asked artists if were o.k with our stuff beeing stolen, and even after we say no, people just disregard it and steal from us anyway. This is some dystopian novel stuff. Ai &quot;art&quot; should only work based on art that the artists gave their specific consent for! Same for photos. These things are crime machines! The general ide of ai tools isnt even bad, but good grief, with how things are this stuff is just theft. Anyone with a conscience should be able to recognize this!!
