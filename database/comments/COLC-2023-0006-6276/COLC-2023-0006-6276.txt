AI steals wherever data gets its hands on, artists in particular. AI doesn&rsquo;t create, it gathers already existing data (like writing, digital artworks, animation, videos) from places like Twitter or Deviant Art. It&rsquo;s hard enough that artists don&rsquo;t get paid enough for their hard work in creative business like in Marvel Studios or Blizzard but with the introduction of AI, artists would even get  paid even less. I implore you, please ban AI and give proper payment to the artists they stole from.
