Giving copyright to AI generated works only devalues the art that is created by human intelligence. It serves no one&#39;s purpose if the activities that provide happiness and joy to humans be overtaken by Artificial Intelligence.<br/><br/>Art is fundamentally human to human connection - a language of symbols and feelings that transfer and transcend boundaries and pulls us towards each other, and pushes us beyond our selves. It inspires, and gives hope, and delights, every human that gets to see them. It is a testament of creation and interpretation existing on some abstract and undefined portions of OUR intellect.<br/><br/>In fact, interpretation is fundamental to art and the value of it can only be determined by humans. If the US Copyright Laws gives legitimacy to overwhelmingly generated content, it will tantamount to removing this fundamental human to human connection. We can marvel at AI art that is produced together, but that is generated by algorithms that have been trained on (previous or currently) copyrighted material which were &quot;freely&quot; taken.<br/><br/>Just as people use Google and Wikipedia, AI art can exist as a freely used (or charged for the service) utility, but the art that truly needs protection are ones that stem from OUR intellect.<br/><br/>I emphasize &quot;our&quot; because that is what laws should ultimately protect. <br/><br/>Since AI algorithms would be useless without the large quantities of freely available data, the art that they produce should also be free to use.<br/><br/>AI art is therefore mere &quot;stylization&quot; of already available art. It is like putting a filter upon the Mona Lisa and claiming it to be &quot;original&quot;. Maybe there is space enough for &quot;curated&quot; AI art, but that should be subject to also be used in further &quot;curation&quot; projects.<br/><br/>It is a tool, and just as recordings of public square may be transformed into music by talented human artists using an audio augmentation software, unless sufficiently transformed by human hands, is not given copyright protection, we should also not extend copyright to the creations of a tool.<br/><br/>If this key protection on AI art is passed, then it will start a cascading deluge of AI art in the art space of the world, which will cause a sever short term choke on artists&#39; livelihoods. I urge the US government, as a concerned citizen of the world, to not provide copyright protection to works generated from generative algorithms.<br/><br/>Let the process of art be instead protected to the organic.
