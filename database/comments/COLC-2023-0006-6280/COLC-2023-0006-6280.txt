I do not believe artificial intelligence content should be able to be copyrighted. While I see the benefits of artificial intelligence, there have already been hundreds if not thousands of pieces of content on the internet that are stolen and/or plagiarised from original content creators that have been created using artificial intelligence. The use of artificial intelligence and being able to copyright content made by artificial intelligence can severely negatively impact content creators everywhere. It would do more damage than good to allow artificial intelligence content to be copyrighted.
