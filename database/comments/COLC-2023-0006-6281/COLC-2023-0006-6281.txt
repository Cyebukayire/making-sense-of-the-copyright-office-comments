Copyright, for artists &amp; authors, has always existed for two main purposes : protect the creative work of artists, and give them a chance to make a living off their creative work. Recent so called &quot;AI&quot; companies have already fully disregarded this aspect of things and knew very well what they were doing when downloading and leeching bilions of images without asking authorization &amp; offering compensation : they wanted to profit the most they could before any legality was worked out by the government first. Now, laws might catch up to them, and so they&#39;d want to shield themselves against consequences by taking down copyright.<br/>It&#39;s enough of this behaviour.<br/>They made billions, got thousands of creative workers out of work in many fields and openly spit on said workers - and usually also push their customers to spit on these workers as well. What an irony since their AI softwares would not even exist in the first place with the thousands of workers they now spit on.<br/>Copyright is really, really the last line of defense small creative workers have against those. If they obtain the right to Fair Use, they will not only destroy all creative workers, but on the long term, self-destruct as well.<br/><br/>Please protect Copyright. We, artists &amp; authors, really need it.
