AI needs powerful regulations. Beyond the scope that AI grows by using nonconsented data from artists and people in general, its easily tainted and will continue growing. We saw the massive issues with the AI Seinfeld series that turned wildly racist and homophobic/transphobic/xeno/etc. <br/>AI can be a powerful tool but it started and stays in the hand of dangerous sociopaths that only wish to gain for very little effort and choose to force people enmass to join in on having their data utilized.<br/><br/>It&#39;s far too easy now to take the photos or videos of someone you hate, deep fake the audio, and make them say horrible things that immediately generates backlash and potentially deadly consequences for the individual targeted all over fake AI driven vindictive actions.<br/><br/>You cannot have both Human Rights while allowing a system like AI to be able to freely trample on a person&#39;s image, voice, and even work. Dozens of my fellow artist friends have been pushed to the brink ready to quit because people have trained AI on their work and impersonate them. There is no sane person who wouldn&#39;t agree that shouldn&#39;t be legal, yet here we are having &#39;conversations&#39; about AI like it has feelings to be hurt. It&#39;s hurting other humans and in vindictive and illegal ways outside of AI being the focal point. Theft and impersonation and copyright infringement are already illegal. Why is stapling AI on there somehow grounds for us to give it a pass? Regulate AI as harshly as possible to protect jobs, to protect people&#39;s identities, and protect people from dangerous actions people can and have produced with deep fakes.
