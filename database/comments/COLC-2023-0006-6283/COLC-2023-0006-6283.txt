I am worried about people&rsquo;s ability to tell AI generated content from human created content. While I&rsquo;m all for teaching media literacy, it&rsquo;s not very feasible to every single person to have the time, research skills, and will to learn how to decipher these things. Regularly, my mom, who is in her late 50&rsquo;s and has had little education on how to navigate today&rsquo;s digital landscape, shows me photos and articles that seem a bit dodgy. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t always tell either. Seems like a bad idea to let these companies gather content (illegally? If not, unethically) to feed to their program so it can spit out pretty convincing crap.
