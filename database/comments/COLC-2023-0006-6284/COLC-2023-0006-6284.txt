I personally believe that much more restrictions should be placed on the way AI is used by corporations. I also full heartedly agree with the notion that when AI is used on a peice of media there should be specifications somewhere that the work used was artificially created. I&rsquo;d also like to say that I&rsquo;d rather not have my art be fed to AI to make more artists loose their jobs for something soulless. Thank you.
