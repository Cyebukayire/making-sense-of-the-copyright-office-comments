Regarding the AI copyright issue, it&#39;s safe to say that it is by all mean a tool, and ONLY, a tool. It does not automatically means that the person who uses AI is safe outside of the already establish rules that run within the creative industry as it is often being correlate to, and other jobs and industries that isn&#39;t often being mentioned of, that require human intellect to solve, create new product. What is often being misunderstood by majority of people is that it is ai, it does not have it&#39;s own thought, or conscious of its own. It&#39;s a machine learning (ML) , and to &quot;learn&quot;, it require the hundred and thousand of materials, COPYRIGHTED materials for it to slightly properly function. ML like midjourney, stablediffusion, Dall E are some of the more popular ML out there that has been actively scraping those exact copyrighted materials for their own gain without paying for any of the thousand of artist and photographer they&#39;ve stole from. AI cannot be copyrighted, or anyway possible, until they can be clean and remove all of their previous stolen work,by starting from ground up.
