Hi, I&#39;m a really small freelance Artist, doing illustrations for mainly one company. But even I already lost a job to AI, because a sister company decided against my sketch but in favor for an AI generated illustration. This shows that even the smallest artists are already affected by AI generated images.<br/>On a different note, I&#39;m also a comic creator drawing my own webcomic. And I DO NOT want my art/artstyle to be used by any AI UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!<br/>All these AI generators for images ARE ACTIVELY STEALING COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL OFF THE INTERNET AND FEEDING THEIR DATABASES WITH THEM. That means that every generated image was put together via stolen property and is therefore stolen and illegal! There is NO WAY AI generated images or writing can be copyrighted, because it&#39;s just stolen from other sources.<br/>AI generators MUST ASK PERMISSION TO USE A COPYRIGHTED IMAGE OR WRITTEN WORK BEFORE USAGE.<br/><br/>So because of all reasons stated above I DEMAND AI GENERATORS AND THE COMPANIES BEHIND THEM TO REMOVE ANY AND ALL COPYWRITTEN MATERIAL FROM THEIR DATABASE, so no further theft can be committed.
