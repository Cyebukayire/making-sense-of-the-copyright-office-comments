A.I. images have been trained with the help of other works from around the internet, without permission or any type of notice that the original images have been used. It is absolutely necessary to have a law or some sort of protection against these type of illegal usages of images or materials since there is no exchange between the artist or original author and the one using the images to train the A.I. . Since most pleople use A.I. for profit there should be a law to fight agains the usage of images and materials belongings to other human creators, especially against their will or knowledge. It is absolutely necessary to first protect and help the original and hardworking creators before trying to undersand why A.I. uses, illegally, images from around the internet. Even if the images are taken for some sort of social media that does not mean that it is free use, most creators, if not all, do not want their work taken, modified or used in these sort of programs. Also, most social medias do not notify or specify if their platform &quot;feeds&quot; any sort of A.I. program, which should be the first thing that is mentioned, and, as a creator, they should be aware of these sort of illegal usages. Just because an image or another sort of original creation is posted on the internet that does not mean that it can be used, modified or fed to these dead, robotic programs.
