Hello and thank you very much for looking out for help and make it better!<br/>It is very important!<br/>I am an author and artist, and I publish my work online. I also part of community of people that share art and written online.<br/>So far, most of it was free - so everyone can see it and comment.<br/>But recently, because of fear from AI, many works were either blocked to spesific users, or just deleted/pulled out of the web. It&#39;s bad and sad.<br/>Because it makes it more than a problem of creators.<br/>It makes it a problem for the global community. A very important thing is being able to share ideas with each other. That&#39;s how humans create more and more complex things. <br/>If people get scared their work would be stollen or copied, they stop share it or only allow spesific users (members, pays, etc.) to access this.<br/>But not everyone can. It blocks those who can&#39;t reach it, and put more barriers in access to work. <br/>More then that, it make problems for creators in money terms.<br/>People can choose to make their work free or for pay, but if a creator scared to share their work, they would get less support (bc no one knows them).<br/>Like, I have several creators I support. But I only met them through their free stuff. If they were scared to share/post, I wouldn&#39;t have supported them.<br/>And they won&#39;t have money, I won&#39;t have stories, and everyone wouldn&#39;t be able to read their things and get the amazing ideas they bring.<br/><br/>I hope it makes sense. <br/>I Just wanted to give my thoughts. Sorry for my English.<br/><br/>TD;LR:<br/>Artists and writers should give consent and receive compensation to be included in a training set, and images and writing resulting from AI should not be eligible for copyright without significant further human manipulation/improvement of the generated image.<br/><br/>Thank you for your important job! Have a nice week!<br/><br/> - P.G., a writer and artist who also supports some others.
