Thank you for allowing people to comment on this. Since it affects me personally, and pretty much everyone in the creative industry I think it&#39;s vital to give creatives, designers, actors, etc a clear voice to speak on the issues they are going to be most affected by.<br/>I myself am an illustrator and have already been negatively impacted by AI technology. I do not hate the technology itself but the way it is currently created and used are unethical and should be addressed appropriately.<br/><br/>In regard to generative AI technology, permission should be mandatory for anything to be included into datasets. This should never fall under fair use because it isn&#39;t the same as a single human using images or text for reference of their own work. We&#39;re talking about millions of images or texts taken without permission, without compensation. <br/>The output of billions of images and texts not generated by a person not only floods the market with spam content and hides real creatives with fake competition, unfair competition under a flood of images, texts and voices stolen from them - it also takes away vital protections creatives need over their IP in order to keep their job, their career and make a living.<br/>Therefore I think it is extremely important to ensure that AI generated outputs, things that don&#39;t come from a human author, to be unable to hold copyright.<br/>And that current AI datasets that have been trained on stolen works be deleted and newly created datasets be completely open and visible so they can be confirmed to have the rights to every image, every text, every voice, and so on.<br/>And lastly, I think it&#39;s vital that the people who are most affected by this, the people working IN the creative industry, the very artists that are being stolen from be given a voice in government instead of merely CEOs of the businesses who stand to profit off of us and are happy to lay us off in favor of technology that couldn&#39;t exist without us.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for the chance to speak on this, I sincerely hope it is taken seriously and that things will be moving in the direction of protecting people instead of businesses.
