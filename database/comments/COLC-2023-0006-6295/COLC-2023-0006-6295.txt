I dont think generative a.i should be banned, but I don&#39;t think it has any place being used by corporations and business entities for money because in its current state its pulling from the entirety of the net. No one thought that the billions of weird images, video, text, and sounds would be used for anything like this let alone to make a profit off of everyone else&#39;s work hard or otherwise. <br/><br/>Anyone who argues that its just a tool is missing the point or trying to sell you something. In what world does generative A.I work without already having data to draw from? It doesn&#39;t do the work that any person making the thing does, its mashing together things based on a predefined pattern in order to achieve a result. While honestly this sort of thing is indeed really neat, it cheapens the value of perceived artistry commercially. If companies like Netflix are planning to use generative A.I to cut costs, whats to stop them from relying or trying to remove writers and artists to cut jobs? Generative A.I can produce things on scale that&#39;s probably the modern day equivalent to the industrial revolution with the touch of a button or typing in a prompt, but it only works if it has the data to do so. <br/>Its honestly my hope that this becomes a consumer novelty rather than a tool that&#39;s regularly used in creative enterprises. I think we all lose out if we allow generative A.I to continue in the way that we&#39;re allowing it because its moving faster than the law can be written.
