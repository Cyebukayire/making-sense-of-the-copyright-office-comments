I do not believe any AI generated works should be able to be copyrighted. I also believe that in order for a work to be able to be used to &ldquo;train&rdquo; an AI permission must first be granted by the owner of that work with the understanding that by granting permission they are allowing the likeness of that work to be potentially featured in anything created by the AI.
