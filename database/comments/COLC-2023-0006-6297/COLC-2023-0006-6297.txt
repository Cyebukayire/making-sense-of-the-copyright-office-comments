Art is highly sought for yet constantly undervalued as it is, and AI generated texts, sounds and images only make the situation worse rather than helping it. AI companies only seem to value monetary profit, made on the backs of artists &ndash; and monetary profit they make in huge numbers.<br/><br/>AI models cannot operate without data (be it visual, text, or sound) taken from artists and without the work of real people sorting and optimising the machine&rsquo;s output, yet the companies developing these models refuse to compensate the artists for that data, or even ask them for their consent. This is not only exploitative but also an obvious violation of copyright laws.<br/>Artists share their work online (often for free) because the very point of art is to be shared, discussed and enjoyed. Never in history did sharing work in public mean that any bystander was free to do it whatever they please and reap massive profits that just so happen to also endanger an entire industry by replacing jobs with machines.<br/><br/>If AI companies are still to be allowed to keep their exploitative tech up and running, they must follow regulations and respect copyright. No data from any artists may be used without their written and unambiguous consent, neither by the AI developers themselves nor by any third party services that mine data from social media, cloud drives etc. Furthermore, artists must be fairly compensated for providing the data that makes AI tech successful if they chose to allow their creations to be used.<br/><br/>As it stands now, neither of these two requirements to prevent copyright infringement are met, and livelihoods are on the line. Rather than running a business between consenting and mutually profiting parties, AI companies commit theft from artists on a global scale.
