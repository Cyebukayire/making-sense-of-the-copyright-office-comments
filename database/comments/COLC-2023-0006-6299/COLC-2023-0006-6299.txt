Please understand that this is theft of work, theft of jobs and talent. It is already happening.  Artists are already losing jobs. Terrible ai &quot;art&quot; is being shown everywhere, as in in accurate scientific renderings.   How long before court cases cover making ai imgs of people being nude without thier consent.   Companies like Adobe have been using artist&#39;s work without citation or consent or payment.   Companies that use ai as &quot;cost saving&quot; have not passed on thier savings to make thier product cheaper, or pay other workers more.  Allowing others to steal the images for thier computer to collage is not art. It is not something that should be copywrightable.
