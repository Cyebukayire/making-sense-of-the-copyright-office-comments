Thank you for providing me with this opportunity to express my feelings. While I appreciate the developments AI has brought to the medical field&mdash;particularly in the field of cancer detection in imaging&mdash;it has terrifying implications for artists. I&rsquo;m a writer (formerly professional, but now it&rsquo;s simply a hobby that makes me happy) and it feels like parts of me are being stolen. To know that what I&rsquo;ve done could be used without my consent to create something else (be it monetized or not) is so disheartening. It makes me not want to create at all. <br/><br/>But aside from that, the use of AI to potential create &ldquo;deep fakes&rdquo; or spread false information&mdash;particularly in the upcoming presidential election cycle&mdash;leaves me with a sense of unease. It would be so easy for someone will I&rsquo;ll intentions to spread misinformation that the general public will instantly believe. <br/><br/>While it may have its uses in making certain things easier, AI is a danger to the creative arts, journalism, and many other fields. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
