Generative AI imagery without an artist&#39;s permission can potentially have devastating consequences for an artist&#39;s life. When AI-generated art is disseminated without proper authorization or compensation, it not only robs artists of their creative control and income but also undermines the value of their original work. This unauthorized replication can flood the market, making it harder for artists to sell their own pieces, sustain their livelihood, or garner recognition for their unique talents. Moreover, it can lead to a loss of trust and ownership in the art world, leaving artists disheartened and discouraged. To protect artists and their livelihoods, it&#39;s crucial that ethical guidelines and regulations are developed to address the challenges posed by generative AI in the context of art creation and distribution.
