AI art is nothing but a ramshackle, horrific Frankenstein&#39;s monster of previously copyrighted material stitched together. The developers of generative AI on the market admit they are completely incapable of creating something new. Instead, they take bits and pieces of art scraped from the internet without the original copyright holder&#39;s permission and return what it associates with a user&#39;s prompt. Said users sometimes go so far as to ask the AI to copy a specific artist&#39;s work, sometimes even a specific piece. While humans are capable of taking influences and combining them with their thoughts and experiences to create something wholly new, AI is only capable of creating wholesale theft.
