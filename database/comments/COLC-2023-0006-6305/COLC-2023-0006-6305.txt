<br/>AI is not an ethical tool for theft and exploitation. He is fully trained on stolen data, he destroys the fate of people, deprives them of work. In the potential future of AI, this is a lot of lost jobs and lives. An artist is a person who spends his whole life perfecting his art. And the corporations steal it and have no punishment. I believe that we, as humanity, must show that ethics is above profit and ban AI in art. At least until she is retrained on ethical rights, where each image will be redeemed with the consent of the author. But even in this case, the final images of AI should not be in commercial products.
