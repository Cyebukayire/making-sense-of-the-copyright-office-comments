I am a musician and artist who received a JD from an accredited California Law School in 2014, with extensive experience in various types of generative digital art.<br/><br/>My major concern is that people who do not understand the rights which exist under copyright jurisprudence seek to enforce what they believe to be their moral rights through such jurisprudence. However they make no effort to understand the *limitations* on copyright, which include such broad topics as research, education, reverse engineering, and many others. All of those limitations are salient when considering the technology that has unfortunately been branded &quot;AI&quot; despite being literally nothing but linear algebra<br/><br/>To the extent people seek to prevent copyright abuses, those concerns can be properly handled elsewhere, such as with processes related to the currently existing DMCA. To seek to impose civil or criminal liability on the users of software simply because the software produced some particular output is draconian and overbroad -- indeed, it gives rise to significant first and fourth amendment implications, as it seeks to restrict how people may use their computers in connection with preparing communications or expressions.<br/><br/>Regarding the five General Questions stated on Notice:<br/><br/>1) It is likely to result in image editing software like Photoshop becoming more powerful tools, enabling a wider breadth of functions -- specifically, functions which drastically improve workflows for some otherwise difficult tasks. The net result will be that people seeking to express themselves visually will have an easier time doing so. Any harms coming from that due to bad actors using such increased ability to do bad acts cannot be pointed to as a justification for disabling the whole of the population from this next natural step in the progress of digital art tools. To the extent it allows any violation of copyright, specifically, that is to be handled by properly servicing copyrights during their life -- it is especially inappropriate to preemptively ban technology for the purpose of supporting current copyright where such new tech, used justly, could be instrumental in forming new unrelated IPs. Any ban must comply with constitutional requirements to be narrowly tailored because this concerns something specifically granted protection in the Bill of Rights: first amendment-protected expressions.<br/><br/>2) In law, work product should be kept private - if any is leaked, then that&#39;s fair game for others to try to analyze and recreate. There already are numerous quasi-legal services like Legalzoom that attempt to do what AI services would attempt to do. It will always fall below the standard of care of the legal profession, however. Likewise, visual and auditory media will involve mimicry that falls below professional standards. To the extent anything made using AI tools is of a professional standard, it will be so because of reasoned, informed decisions in how to implement those ML functions into a larger workflow. There is no legitimate concern regarding AI content beyond what there already is from simply copying and pasting. The potential for word processors to produce plagiarism does not give rise to a need to ban word processors.<br/><br/>3) I do not have any studies to cite. However I do wish to call attention to basic constitutional principles because this concerns the creation and publication of literature, art, music and other media, and so any laws or policies must be subject to strict scrutiny with deference toward encouraging expressions. The legal functions of copyright are to be limited by constitutional principles, and expansions of copyright must be subject to those same limits. It is worth considering whether copyright is already at the maximum of what those limitations allow -- i.e. whether any expansions could even be permissible at all.<br/><br/>4) International consistency is very important, considering all of this occurs in the forum that is the internet. If international laws are vastly different, then there arises the issue of people simply using websites hosted in other countries, perhaps using VPNs if needed. These principles that limit US Copyright law are relevant to the international discussions, because they necessarily limit companies based in the US, which comprise a significant proportion of websites in the current climate.<br/><br/>5) In my opinion, no. The current laws are as clear as they need to be: fair use exceptions clearly include researching a subject matter by collecting and analyzing examples of it. Copyright law would only be implicated if people sought to publish the content of such databases, but that is so far from what is being done that it is only worth mentioning for sake of clarification. I believe the public deserves a clear statement about the processes involved in what is embellished as &quot;AI&quot;, as well as about Fair Use in the first place. How can people properly evaluate this without knowing the extent of Fair Use?
