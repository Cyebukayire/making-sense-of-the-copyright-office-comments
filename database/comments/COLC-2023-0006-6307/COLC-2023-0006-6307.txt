Since this apparent technology (AI) has been around for years, it feels unjust to change a service&#39;s trajectory to involve the invasive practice. I&#39;ve uploaded personal art pieces and client work with no intentions of it training AI. I&#39;ve uploaded since 2012 to these social media platforms but now feel stunted because of the secret practices that have been undisclosed or thrust upon users. Example: Twitter (X) implementing this technology leaves many artists like ourselves vulnerable and possibly taken advantage of with its practices suddenly written in to profit XAI.
