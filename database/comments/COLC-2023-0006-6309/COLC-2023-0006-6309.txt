Many artists are distressed by encroachment of AI&#39;s artwork on the content they create and the concerned about what this means for livelihood. I do not believe AI should be copyrightable at all, and the the uncopyrighted material should be the proverbial price that someone has to pay for using AI generated content without the express permission of the original users. This doesn&#39;t apply to text only content, as there would be far too many people to reasonably contact about copyright issues.<br/><br/>In addition, systems must be opted in by default in the sense that somebody must explicitly consent to adding their content to a AI training database for artwork rather than being forced agree to an opt out policy. Again, this only applies to non text content because it would be too difficult turn track down any author who contributed texts there&#39;s an AI derived its output from. Especially if said authors are dead.
