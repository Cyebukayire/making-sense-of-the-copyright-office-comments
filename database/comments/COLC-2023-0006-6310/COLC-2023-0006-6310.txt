First of all thanks for giving us the chance to express ourselves.<br/><br/>As many of my fellow artist, I demand a fair use of AI and can&#39;t accept its current form. Consent, credit and compensation are 3 necessary elements that should be part of every diffusion model system. Opt out should be the initial starte and only artists that agree having their data should see their data being fed to the system. The fact that curently the data is taken without any consent is a violation of copyrights. Credit and compensation should be given to the artists that have their data trained. <br/>The models should be trained only on either 1) free of right data or 2) data given with consent.<br/><br/>There should be transparency about how the companies get their data. The current data laundering trick, with AI companies getting their data from a &quot;non profit&quot; organization to protect themselves from copyright laws, should be adressed and prohibited.<br/><br/>Also, education about those topics should be mandatory, especially in big companies. Those models in their current form are now released to the public with very few information about the data laundering part and copyright issues, which of course leads to their massive use without questionning, among people and companies. If masses would be more aware of how those system works and how they gather data, the progress on copyright laws could be faster in my opinion.<br/><br/>Thanks again for allowing us to comment and I look forward to see the progress of these laws.
