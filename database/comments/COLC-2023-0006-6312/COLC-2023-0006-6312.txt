My intellectual property is mine. Through blood, sweat, and tears I&rsquo;ve finished my works and I will not now or ever consent to another person, or machine stealing my work for learning purposes or anything else. What&rsquo;s being allowed for the purpose of AI isn&rsquo;t a slippery slope, it&rsquo;s a mudslide. AI is a danger to human intelligence. It allows for a machine to do our thinking so that ideas are no longer our own, but a mixture of ideas from other creatives. It&rsquo;s wrong on so many levels and it makes it impossible for people to stand out on their own merit. I paid for copyrights to protect me against this. Any other use of my intellectual property is not what I paid for.
