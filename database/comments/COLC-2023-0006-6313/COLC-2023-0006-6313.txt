It is my personal belief that this &quot;AI&quot; poses a threat both to creativity itself and public safety. We already have instances of AI stealing work from both accomplished and lesser known artists and writers, in a rather widespread fashion. Its creators have also taken to writing books using this software, creating catastrophic results. Field guides misidentifying poisonous plants as safe, confusing children with false facts about the animal kingdom, and countless other recorded instances of harm and perpetuated ignorance.<br/><br/>These &quot;AI&quot; programs are both an insult and threat to the human spirit. They threaten the education and even lives of our children with their misinformation. They mock human innovation and creativity with Frankensteinian works, stitched together from the cut up stylings of real, human artists.<br/><br/>They are a plague, and a threat, and must not be allowed free reign into our creative or educational fields.
