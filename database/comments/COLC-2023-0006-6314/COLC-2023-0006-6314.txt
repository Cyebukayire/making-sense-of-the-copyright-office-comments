I&#39;m an author, artist, and consumer of artistic products. GenAI impacts my access to freelance work and devalues the publics&#39; perception of my artistic products. I graduated with a BA in writing on November 2022 and haven&#39;t been able to gain employment in my field due to the roll out of GenAI text. The tech companies claiming to support the creative fields are in fact destroying the already often poverty stricken creatives who are right now striking for living wages. <br/><br/>As a creative, I need GenAI to be regulated to protect the intrinsic value of my works. GenAI should be limited to personal use only, Opt-In training requirements (instead of the current Opt-Out) on copyrighted datasets, GenAI tech being required to register with the copyright office to certify the dataset operated within copyright limitations, and their generated text and images should not be protected under copyright due to the generative nature devaluing the artistic products human artists need to sell. <br/><br/>As a consumer, I need products to be labeled as containing GenAI so I can make informed purchasing decisions. The current lack of regulation has resulted in severe damage to authors&#39; professional images due to their accidental use of GenAI stock art or their being scammed by book cover artists presenting GenAI as human-made. It&#39;s also caused artists to lose commercial clients, lose jobs, and lose the publics&#39; trust. The political risk of Deep-Fakes is extreme. I&#39;ve already filed a report with the FBI after receiving Deep-Fakes of a beloved children show host doing gang signs while holding a gun with text threatening to kill me. The images are believed to be sent at random and my report has stopped me from receiving future texts so my hope is the FBI stopped those perpetrators. There&#39;s countless social media stories of women and children being turned into GenAI porn without consent and in violation of child protection laws. These risks are due to the lack of regulation. <br/><br/>GenAI must be regulated for public safety and to protect the value of human-made works. Failure to regulate weakens copyright, damages consent, and creates products capable of impacting governmental public relations.
