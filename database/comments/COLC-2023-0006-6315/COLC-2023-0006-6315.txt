At the present, artificial intelligence programs farm the internet for content. They take already copyrighted works of art or writing and put them in a database which the program pulls from. Nothing created by current a.i. programs is original. They cannot be copyrighted since the works they draw from already are copyrighted by someone else. This should be tabled until such a time that artificial intelligence can create truly original works.
