Copyright law already covers what AI is doing. <br/>U.S. copyright law provides copyright owners with the following exclusive rights: Distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental, lease, or lending.<br/>A copy as defined as per copyright law: &ldquo;Copies&rdquo; are material objects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. The term &ldquo;copies&rdquo; includes the material object, other than a phonorecord, in which the work is first fixed.<br/>Anything that is shared digitally is made up of code, visually we are expressed an image but behind that image is code that allows it to be transferred from screen to screen over the internet. Each code created from each artwork is unique, no two codes will create the same artwork (unless they are the same code in different languages, ie. C++ vs SQL). Therefore these &ldquo;codes&rdquo; of each artwork are copies, which belong to the copyright holder. As per copyright law the owner has the right to say how each copy of their work is distributed, so any instance of a copyright code that is in a dataset needs to be deleted unless otherwise stated by the copyright holder. Unless the use of this copy is permitted via &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; which would require proof that it is not being used for monetary gain, and will not affect market value of the original work. <br/>There is no question that AI in its current form needs to be regulated and reimagined. Any copies that were unlawfully obtained need to be disposed of. <br/>
