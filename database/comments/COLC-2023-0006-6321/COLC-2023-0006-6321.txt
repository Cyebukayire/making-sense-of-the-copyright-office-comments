If you not doing a private work (as a hobby or practice) and intend to publish it, should you be using someone else&#39;s work on it, you need to get their permission. And even if the resulting work fall under Fair Use, crediting is still required. <br/><br/>Generative AI does none of that. It took the creative work of people from across the globe, took private and even sensitive data from people across the globe in order to get this software to work. And permission wasn&#39;t asked, and not a single piece is credited. It also fails under Fair Use because not only it often might be found to just create pieces that would be too derivative to be protected by it, but at times the results are even exact copies of an uncredited source. In addition, in the intended use case, Generative AI competes with the creators of which Generative AI depends to exist (for example: takes illustration from professional illustrators, and the AI promises to generate professional Illustrations). <br/><br/>And this has costed jobs, as people are forced to compete with themselves. Its a disruptive software that is crumbling the markets to which it owns its very existence. By the current laws, all across the globe, none of that should be legal, taking someone else&#39;s for for their own benefit is a crime, especially if commercially, and they cause a market disruption that shouldn&#39;t be allowed. This mass theft might be hard to pin down everyone affected, but - from the very beginning - the developers proudly announced they were stealing from everyone, and despite this open admission to committing a crime, still nothing was done about it. <br/><br/>And all of that is just for its intended use. <br/><br/>Generative AI is being abused to facilitate multiple forms of crime, fraud, deepfakes, intentional misinformation, harassment, theft. The AI makes it easy to trick someone into falling for way too many scams, makes it easy to get past security measures from banks, and so on. Crime will always exist, but Generative AI has been mainly used to facilitate crimes, to the point the CIA even had to make an announcement about it, that alone, should be grounds to ban this tech, or at the very least severely restrict its public access. And still, nothing is being done about it.<br/><br/>Nothing good has come out of this. It has only benefited criminals to commit more crime and CEOs who will gladly cut costs by replacing the very workers who made their companies, with a tool that is built with their very work.<br/><br/>None of this should have been allowed to happen. <br/><br/>All of this is illegal and action should have been taken the moment the developers proudly announced their crime. Them also releasing this under open source, aggravates this as it will make that much harder to get rid of this. Completely irresponsible attempt to avoid accountability. The developers &quot;Fair Use&quot; defense is nonsense, and they know it. <br/><br/>But this also highlight a flaw in Public Domain. This all should be illegal now, but if Public Domain is not protected from Generative AI, this could be considered &quot;legal&quot; someday, however the market disruption aspect of it should still prevent it from happening.<br/><br/>So with all that considered. <br/>I think Generative AI should be Banned, and the developers punished for releasing it to the public without any consideration and without doing anything about the mass crime they facilitated; <br/>I also think Generative AI or any AI development for that matter, should not be given exemptions that allow them to use the work and data of others;<br/>And Public Domain should be protected from AI.<br/><br/>This should never have happened, and should never be allowed to happen again.
