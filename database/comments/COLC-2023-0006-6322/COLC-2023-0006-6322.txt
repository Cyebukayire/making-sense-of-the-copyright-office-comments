AI, like any technology, is just that - a technology. It&#39;s a tool that can be used for both positive and negative.<br/>I do not trust the world, as it currently is, to use it for positive. I do not trust the film industry to not eliminate every  job within itself for cost cutting. I do not trust the publishing industry to not just so generate swarms of novels. I do not trust the games industry to not replace devs with ai&#39;s. I do not trust a capitalist world with this technology. When everyone&#39;s goal is making as much money as possible, a technology that can make content production bassically free, with no employees to pay required, is going to be nothing but disaster for everyone, everywhere.
