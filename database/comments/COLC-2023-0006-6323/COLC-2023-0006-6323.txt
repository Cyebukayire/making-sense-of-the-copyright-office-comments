As a digital artist, I spend hours on each piece, constantly making decisions about each mark I make. It&#39;s taken me decades of hard work and continuous education to build my skills. That a person with a computer program, trained on my artwork, my decisions about where to place each mark, could generate artwork in my style and call it their own, and enjoy the protection of copyright because they described an image like mine to a computer, is absurd.<br/>Copyright should only extend to works made by people. It should not be available to those who program a computer to make a very impressive collage, without the permission of the artists who&#39;s works are included.
