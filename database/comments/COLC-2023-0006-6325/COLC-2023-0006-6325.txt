The use of AI artificial is in no way forms ready for any sort of government and personal use, and a great example would be the current protests happening in the creative field. The readiness to copy and use the voices of people with no consent is blatant and violating, the use of Ai Generated art have the same effects of artist losing their work to AI. There is no way for use to consume Ai ethically at this moment and those who are pushing for Ai, often do not see the need to credit let alone understand they are in the wrong. People are fighting for their livelihood!!
