I believe there is a very simple to define criteria which can help distinguish what is and is not &quot;created&quot; by a machine learning model. But, foremost, I think it is important to address these programs as &quot;machine learning models&quot; and specifically not &quot;AI&quot; because they do not constitute artificial intelligence. They are complex programs, but not capable of independent thought and cannot claim personhood, the term &quot;AI&quot; is used to insinuate this and lend creadamce to the idea that it can and therefore could own something (which it cannot, to be clear).<br/><br/>The question then becomes: what is created and who is doing the work? &quot;Generative content&quot; by most standards does not constitute creation, but more of a remix. It literally cannot do what it does without the training material it has memorized. And the user utilizing the machine learning model (MLM), couldn&#39;t create the content produced by an MLM without the MLM in most cases.<br/><br/>The following criteria can thus be used to determine which party should have the rights to &quot;ownership&quot; by determining the burden of work. If a user generated a piece of content through an MLM by inputtig any set of data and receives a price of content (in this case, art, writing, computer code, etc.) and publishes it, they did not do a substantial amount of work and cannot claim ownership. This is comparable to an employer hiring a contract worker to complete a project which is then owned by the employev company; but in the case of a human contract worker, that worked can consent to transfer ownership from somethig they created to the employer. But a program is not a person and cannot consent to such, ASSUMING that the program created the content on its own. It would then fall to the owner of the program to transfer ownership to the user, again, assuming the program owner can claim ownership of the created material.<br/><br/>Conversely, if a user inputs data and receives content from an MLM as before but then significantly alters that content they may be able to claim ownership. Alternatively, if the user creates a query for an MLM consisting of a large degree of content owned by that user and is not requesting the MLM to make significant changes to that data, the user may have claim over the content then generated by the MLM. As an example, imagine a user requests that an MLM take a dataset owned by the user and organize it in a table, the dataset still belongs to the user and the table (as a basic organizational element) does not belong to anyone. Or imagine that a user requests an MLM to draft a basic outline for a written work but then the user writes a the work itself using the outline, the user/writer created the finished work and not the MLM.<br/><br/>This leaves the matter of rights of ownership of individuals who&#39;s work was used as training material for an MLM. Given that list MLMs are trained from broad datasets and narrowed to specific purpose, content owners cannot adequately determine how their work mught be used and therefore cannot transfer that right unless they the owner explicitly grant use for a particular MLM training dataset. In the instance of a social media platform (SMP) granting rights to MLM designers to data from their platform, the MLM designer does not have explicit consent from the owner of the content, even if the SMP states that it allows MLM designers to scrape data from their platform in the user agreement. As the SMP cannot claim ownership of the content on their platform, only the platform itself.<br/><br/>Therefore a MLM can only be trained on materials that have no owner (such as public domain works) or materials which are explicitly authorized by their owners for the specific MLM. Further, to prevent degeneration of content quality (not in a moral sense, but a factual and material sense), an MLM should not be allowed to train on material produced by another MLM; consequently all materials produced to any significant degree by an MLM must be labled as such using specific and predetermined language (e.g., &quot;material produced primarily through the use of *MLM name*&quot;).
