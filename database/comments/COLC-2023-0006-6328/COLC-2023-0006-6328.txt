It seems clear that generative &quot;AI&quot; is just recombining the data it was trained on; so the copyright to output generated by such a program should REMAIN in the hands of the authors of the data it was trained on. A few examples:<br/><br/>1) I generate a lot of text myself, and train a program with that text. I should own the copyright to the output of that program.<br/><br/>2) I train a program on the complete works of Jane Austin. If (as I believe) Jane Austin&#39;s works are in the public domain, the output of the program should be in the public domain.<br/><br/>3) I contact a number of current authors, and get permission to train my program on their works. The output of the program should be constrained by the agreements I worked out with the authors, with the default being that the copyright belongs to the authors of the training data.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
