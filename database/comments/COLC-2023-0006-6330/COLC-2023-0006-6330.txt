I am against granting copyright to work generated by what is commonly termed artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>The process is in no way similar to the creative process a human being uses, and relies on the use of previously existing work without the permission of, or any compensation to, the IP holders of that work.<br/><br/>I believe the developers of automated generation systems were acting in the legal definition of bad faith in their early use of non-profit status to assemble datasets.
