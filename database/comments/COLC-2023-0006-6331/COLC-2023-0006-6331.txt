&quot;AI&quot; is not artificial intelligence. These are pattern recognition and regurgitation algorithms. They do not think, they do not make decisions, they are programmed to gather and steal as much content as possible, and then to rearrange the content based on pattern recognition only when prompted. They do not create. Their users do not create. This is technology that is dangerous, used for dangerous purposes, and can only benefit the rich and unscrupulous. Creations using this technology should never be allowed to hold copyrights, because there will always be identifiable elements of other people&#39;s work, voices, or likeness. The only way to produce work that can&#39;t be deconstructed, is to allow the technologists to build the machine in such a way that we can&#39;t inspect what it is doing. No copyright. No acceptance. Protect workers.
