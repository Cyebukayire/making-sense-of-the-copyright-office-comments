I do not believe any piece of media created by AI technology should be copyrighted These programs are trained on already copyrighted materials, whether that be artwork, literature, or even someone&#39;s own voice. And this is usually done with the consent of the original creator and is used to create a poor imitation and then claiming it as original. At its base level this is theft and will significantly impact people&#39;s careers ans livelihoods. Studios are already replacing artists and writers with AI, putting people out of jobs for programs that barely have to be paid, if at all. It is despicable and morally bankrupt.<br/>Therefore anything that has been created by AI should never be allowed to be copyrighted as it using stolen work from actual real people.<br/>Furthermore I believe that the only way AI would have an ethical place in modern society is if all its preexisting data is permanently erased, all the creatives who have been plagiarized have been properly financially compensated, and the AI programs are retrained exclusively on images/texts that are in the public domain along with crediting the original image/text in the copyright. And studios/corporations may only use AI in the early beginning stages of production, not in the finished final product.<br/>There should also be more protections for artists against AI scraping to prevent theft of this scale from ever happening again and if it does the artists can take the case to court and receive the proper compensation/justice. Thank you.
