Artificial Intelligence is a direct violation of copyright law when in reference to the creative fields. Because of the current unregulated state of AI both on the internet and in business, several thousands of artists work is being used without their consent to feed into the algorithms. This data is then used to churn out content that looks similar enough to another artists work, but made cheaply and with less quality. Several artists across the world (ie on social media platforms, X in particular, and in the business world alike, such as Adobe) has stated their own distain against using AI both to make their work and having their content fed into. As an artist myself, it took thousands of hours and years of my life to hone in my craft, and all that effort is put to waste if someone simply decides they like my work, resulting in those projects being fed into an AI to churn out lesser quality pictures with a minute fraction of human passion behind it. AI is a direct violation of creativity and the sheer uniqueness of humanity. All artists deserve to have protection from their art being stolen without consent. If the case where AI continues to fly free from copyright laws, it will inevitably end in the downfall of human creativity and the concept of storytelling alike.
