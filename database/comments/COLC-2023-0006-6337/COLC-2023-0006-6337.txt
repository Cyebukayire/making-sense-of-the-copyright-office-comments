AI has a place in this world, as a tool to aid all in their pursuits of achievement and creation, whether it brings the user wealth, or enlightenment, or even just happiness to do something they once found impossible for them. But in their current form, and use cases, they instead cause massive damage, and if allowed to continue without strong regulation of the technology, major corporations, and ill-will actors will use these tools for their illicit gains, at the harm of the true creators of content that the machines use without permission, and without any due compensation. On top of the fiscal harm it does to human creators, it harms the trust that has been built by not only individuals but smaller group who depend on giving accurate and quality products, where AI simply generalizes at best, and completely misinforms at worse, and as it seems in the current climate of these technologies, far more frequently than their creators would lead us to believe. I implore the Copyright Office to use every bit of its powers to build proper protections against this horrific abuse of copyright, caused by gross negligence of the violators who used and created the current climate of AI, for it is necessary if we are to strike the right and just balance where AI and human creation can exist peacefully.
