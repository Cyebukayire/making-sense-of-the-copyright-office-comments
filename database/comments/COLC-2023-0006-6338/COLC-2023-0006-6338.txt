AI models should not be using copyrighted material for training without the express consent of the copyright holder and creator. &#39;AI technicians&#39; have been using copyrighted material to make their engines the is entire time without the knowledge or consent of those it pulled work from. It&#39;s immoral and should be illegal! Any person who&#39;s copyrighted material to teach its AI generative model without the express permission of the copyright holder or illegally obtained should have their AI engine deleted/destroyed and pay restitution for anyone who&#39;s copyrighted material they used. And AI generated material cannot be copyrighted. It was not made a by a specific human. It would be like if I used programming to take the disney logo and the target logo, put them over each other in photoshop and then claimed that was something I/the computer made itself. AI is not intelligent or creative, it is just a machine to take art/writing and smoosh it together better.
