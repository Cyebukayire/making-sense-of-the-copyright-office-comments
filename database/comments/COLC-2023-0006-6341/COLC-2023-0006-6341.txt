To whom this may concern,<br/><br/>The introduction of Artificial Intelligence software into the creative community has not only proved to be harmful to its economy but also to the copyright of the artists themselves. These programs collect images/ artwork of artists all across the world and use them to train their software.  Not only is this not consensual, but it is violating basic terms of copyright. Artists make commissions off the sale of their artwork and usage rights when working with a client. When AI software collects these images from artists (without consent), the creators of the artworks do not receive any compensation or notification of this action. <br/>This is active theft. And should be a CLEAR violation of copyright. <br/><br/>To make matters worse, the AI images generated from the software are being passed off as the prompter&#39;s own artwork. Jobs are popping up for AI prompters when there is an entire industry of creators who are more than willing to create artwork from their own hands and brains. <br/><br/>Please adapt the law to protect artist&#39;s rights and their artwork from AI-generating software and users.
