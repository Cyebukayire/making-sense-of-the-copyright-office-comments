AI as we know it today is not only unethical but illegal usage of data.<br/>Artists, writers photographers... are getting robbed without consent and compensation. This is not a tool, it is a way to unethically profit on the backs of thousands of artists. A tool by definition is something that one uses to enhance their skill, with generative AI we saw time and time again that the smallest changes im the system differ the results of so money so called AI artists who are complaining about the changes. If one is full reliant of the &quot;tool&quot; then it by definition is not a tool and therefore not a way to create human art. That outcome not being abe to be copyrighted is the only logical outcome but artists still get negative consequences. AI datasets as we have them need to be redone, also is a ruling of 100% clearance needed where it is clearly shown, what images or writings are being used. Programs that detect AI generated material is already implimented but they need to get even better. All in all regulation is needed and companies that used datasets they weren&#39;t allowed to, should have to take responsibility and not only take out the used datasets and pay for the damage they dealt, but a public honest and direct appology to show who is in the right in this matter is a must. I was excited when I was younger about possible futuristic technology, now that it seems more likely I am just affraid and anxious that we as a population go down the road of catastrophy scenarios with this newly found innovation, I hope for a future where AI gives as the freedom to pursue creativity instead of life limiting work and not the other way around because as of today we let AI do what we love to do and not what we hate to do.
