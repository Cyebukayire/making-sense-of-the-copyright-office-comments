The AI/machine learning field needs to be heavily regulated, in my opinion. There&#39;s very little stopping anyone from feeding someone&#39;s art or writing into one of these programs to generate work based on stolen sources and claiming it as their own. Artists are losing their unique style, which could be considered a trademark of sorts, to these machines that can almost perfectly emulate it. Several writers have had AI-generated books released under their names without their knowledge on Amazon and Amazon has done nothing to remove these works that tarnish a good author&#39;s name.<br/><br/>There&#39;s nothing stopping someone from stealing someone&#39;s vocal print to make them say something that the person with the stolen voice would not usually say. Many voice actors in the industry have spoken out about how violating and dehumanizing such practices are, when they put their heart and soul into a performance, only to have someone come along and steal that performance through machine learning.<br/><br/>It&#39;s eating into the field of creatives all over and turning passion projects into soulless husks generated solely to drive a profit. Please heavily regulate these tools and protect creators!
