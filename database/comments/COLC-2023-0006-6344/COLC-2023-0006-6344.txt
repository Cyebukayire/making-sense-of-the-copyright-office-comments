Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. It would ensure workers&#39; material is protected from people seeking to abuse AI in order to a) avoid compensating these workers for their labor or b) plagerize their work and seel it as their own. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense, especially if we are seeking to maintain a labor force instead of diminish it for selfish, myopic gains.
