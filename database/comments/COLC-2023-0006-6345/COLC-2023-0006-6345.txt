AI is not art - how would they be able to copyright something that was stolen from another person? Especially when I see people using AI to recreate the work of artists who have passed. If they want to do art, then they can pick up a pencil like the rest of us and create something. Not steal. We should not be allowing theft. How is it ethical to replace actors and writers with AI? For the sake of the rich to get richer?
