I am commenting on the use of AI to create images that are trained or fed copyrighted images and writing from artist and writers who have posted on social media or on their own platforms. The US Government should regulated AI Art and Writing to be prohibited from being copyrighted, used in commercial advertisements and in any business use. The sharing of AI writing and art should be clearly marked on the work in order to not deceive readers or viewers of the original sharer&rsquo;s capabilities and skills. Companies should be prohibited from using copyrighted work that is posted on their platforms to train AI engines. Companies should be prohibited from writing terms and conditions that overrule laws in regards to copyright laws in the US. There is no just reason for companies to include any terms that intent to remove US citizen&rsquo;s rights and protection from the US government laws. I believe that an artist and creator should have the right to train AI engine for their own use. Please do not let users of AI engine that produce writing and artwork to be able to copyright that work if it uses copyrighted work, even if the creators have not filed for copyright with your office first.
