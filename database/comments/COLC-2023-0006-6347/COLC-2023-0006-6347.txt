I am a freelance and formerly-employed artist in NYC, a city with a high living cost and struggling economy. I depend on visual storytelling and artistic craft to earn my keep and I am currently having a trying time to even make a profit. Training for these skills and experiences has defined my whole life and I do not take any insult or blight against the industry lightly. If AI dominates all the available jobs in the market one day, I will deem myself worthless and will find it impossible to ignore how I wasted my life. It takes years to be excellent at drawing, painting, designing, editing, animating, and just brainstorming great ideas. This is how it should remain in the future: for passionate and organic work to be produced by a human being, and for them to be compensated fairly and just, under respectful working conditions and the promise that there will always be people recruiting more artists in the future. Please PLEASE don&#39;t let workers rights get eliminated! It is PEOPLE who bring prosperity to the world, not machines. Thank you for reading.
