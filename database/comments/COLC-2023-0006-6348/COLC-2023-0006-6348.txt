It is my belief as an artist and individual that works produced via artificial intelligence should not be protected by copyright law. Many of the programs used to generate art are known to use copyrighted works in their training datasets without the knowledge or consent of the copyright holder. This should be viewed as a violation of copyright. What&#39;s more, protecting ai generated works under copyright law would set a dangerous precedent as organizations would no longer need to pay human artists to create art for them, likely leading to loss of jobs throughout the fine art sector.
