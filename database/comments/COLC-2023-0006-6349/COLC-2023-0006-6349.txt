Actual artist (traditional and digital - made honestly - from scratch) - thank you for allowing me to comment <br/>Honest artists are not exactly popular right now - especially when they speak out <br/>first: I don&#39;t understand why input from the public (some of whom are actual art thieves) is being sought ???   :(<br/>my art is MY intellectual property and should not be up for consideration by anyone else - especially those who want to steal it <br/>note: someone who goes into a store and robs it - guess what? they will get arrested <br/>but ... rob an artist ? hey ....  that&#39;s ok  :(<br/>Sorry for venting - but I think you need to hear how artists feel ....<br/><br/>I am a later in life, but emerging artist - prolific and regarded as talented (you can check me out - though most of my art hidden of course ;) - I  want to make income from this and supplement retirement <br/>Don&#39;t even get me started on young emerging artists - who have their careers destroyed - before they even start :(<br/><br/>Unfortunately: right now talent and being prolific means it has to basically stay in my sketchbook - I am petrified of working several <br/>collections (surface pattern collections) - worth a LOT of $$$$ - often staying in my sketchbook - as it will be hoovered up by AI tech - its very depressing <br/><br/>- also: it costs a LOT OF $$$$$  to register my art - artists cannot afford this - AI tech KNOWS this <br/>- photographers have it much easier (good for them) - waaay cheaper - <br/>- so why NOT the same low cost to register for artists <br/>- also: even registered art ? is that even safe anymore ?<br/><br/> - all of this . is. wrong !<br/><br/>facts: <br/>1. we all know about children&#39;s book illustrators and authors being stolen from <br/>(and also how some of those are getting rewarded with significant corporate positions :(  <br/><br/>but ... another area - Surface Pattern Design - the art of (mainly) repeat patterns on products  - needs to have a very BIG light shone on it <br/> - worth if I recall at least hundreds of millions per year in the US<br/><br/>2. AI art is competing directly with Surface Pattern Designers<br/>- one major POD (Print on Demand) pattern platform<br/> - Spoonflower - are actually (knowingly) selling AI art patterns !! (work stolen from artists) - and getting away with it  !! - while claiming  (bs) alll over FB that they support independent (real) artists (and use that same claim of supporting actual artists to push their platform  - which includes AI (stolen) art  ! - staggering) <br/><br/>- actual SPD artists afraid to speak out (as I suspect they fear they may lose what little business they have on Spoonflower) and also; afraid to speak out (as negativity online leads to business loss - negativity is a huge no no in the art world of SPD) <br/>https://www.spoonflower.com/en/shop/ai-art?gclid=CjwKCAjw3dCnBhBCEiwAVvLcu8PT1e7KFMSfD36Mn9OMuUl2O3VJ1jnQsiSt1ZZ8rDWbTDd8ATvxSxoCnIsQAvD_BwE<br/><br/>how are AI artists doing this ? and uploading to the likes of (not exclusively) Spoonflower ?<br/>Tutorials all over Youtube - Midjourey AI artists (thieves) - showing how to put stolen artwork scraped up by Midjourney via prompts and upload to POD sites - the level of thievery and lack of remorse is mindblowing<br/>https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=midjourney+repeat+patterns<br/><br/>Re: Youtube search <br/>You will see a lot of the AI artists show up - <br/>Unfortunately; you may see legit artists show up <br/>But it will be obvious who is who<br/><br/>Even if the art was not stolen ... an AI artist can spit out in a few seconds a repeat pattern to upload to a POD and sell - a <br/>pattern that could take an actual artists - a week or more (research; sketch (iterations); paint and /or digitize; put in repeat (and so much more in between) <br/> - this is unfair competition for actual artists /surface pattern designers trying to pay the bills  - <br/>actual artists would never dream of using a keyboard (not how we are wired) and why would we anyway? when we draw etc from scratch <br/>AI artists can ONLY use a keyboard; Photoshop retouch (pushing pixels around does not count)<br/><br/>Also: just now - shocked ...<br/>I Googled .. &quot;use chatgpt to create repeat patterns&quot;<br/><br/>They are now using chatgpt to write crochet patterns !! <br/>Talk about destroying not just art but HERITAGE - <br/>- these precious skills are often handed down and treasured<br/>AI has now ripped this little cottage industry apart at the seams !<br/>This . is .  sick .... revolting <br/><br/>So ... why is this even happening in 2023 ? :(<br/><br/>note: its NOT just Midjourney - too many software companies are auto doing an opt in for artists (they dont even have to <br/>be an art software -<br/>artists should not have to opt out (silent opt in is stealing ...)<br/><br/>Crazy when you do art - and come up with turning point good stuff - and are afraid to even take a phone snap low res of it<br/>and take it into a digital program to do the rest<br/>-but this is my work; my soul; my income; my life<br/><br/>- if a thief robs your house - they cannot get away with it by saying  - sorry - you did not opt out <br/>- but it seems corporate can .... :(<br/><br/>thank you for listening :(<br/><br/>
