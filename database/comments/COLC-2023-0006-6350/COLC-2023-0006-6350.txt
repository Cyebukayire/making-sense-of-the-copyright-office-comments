Ai, especially generative AI, is the personification of mass theft of all creatives in many fields. It robs them of their own work, personal expression, copyright, art, voices, and uses that to compete in the same market as those in creatives. This puts thousands upon millions out of work form this exploitation. In addition, generative AI has given rise to a new form of disturbing cyberbullying where people have targeted creatives and bullied them by training generative AI on their work without their permission. There should be no copyright given to a program that is built on the foundations of theft. Giving such a program copyright sends a very disturbing message that theft and exploitation comes first and foremost before content and compensation. We are supposed to have protections against such exploitation and I hope we will in the near future.
