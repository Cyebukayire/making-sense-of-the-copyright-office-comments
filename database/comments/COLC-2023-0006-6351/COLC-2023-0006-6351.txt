AI generated content, when used, ought to be a societal benefit. If someone&#39;s job is &quot;taken by AI,&quot; especially a skilled worker or one who has spent years of specialized preparation to enter their field, that person deserves reimbursement of some type. If AI is able to automate job processes, we as a society deserve to share the benefits--companies and business owners will benefit from AI tools and/or workers that can work faster and for longer, so it is only fair that human workers receive benefits too (for example, the payment they could have earned from entering their field, or a portion of it).
