Any AI work is based on already existing works made by human beings and in most cases the work has been stolen or copied. Without clear consent by the creator AI works should not be made especially if the person who made the work with AI will not disclose if they got permission from the original artist they got their material from. Not to mention that if any document of work by a media company (Disney, Netflix, publishing company etc ...)is leaked someone could copy the work with AI and profit of it causing a lot of legal issues.
