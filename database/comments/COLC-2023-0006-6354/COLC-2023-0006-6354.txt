I believe that the presence of Ai which can mimic human creativity must be severely regulated. Artist, writers and others enganged in creation must have the same protections over their work that they do currently in terms of an entity making something so similar as to be indiscernable from their own work. If I go on a website or store and see an image that looks like something by my favorite artist, I would want to give money to that artist and not to a person that asked an ai to make an image similar to that artist. Companies should be prevented from using Ai to mimic the work of real people. This practice by intention or by effect, robs artists of a livlihood and recognition for their craft. Automation can absolutely be a great thing, but we should not be swift to automate the human imagination and soul.
