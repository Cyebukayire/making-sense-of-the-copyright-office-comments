AI is to artificial intelligence as those &#39;hovercraft&#39; boards were a few years ago being actual hovercrafts. It&#39;s procedurally generated code that is making up things as it goes like predictive typing on your average email program. Additionally, they will completely ruin several industries if AI-generated material is allowed copyright, including but not limited to: Movies, music, television shows, streaming services, video games, journalism, scientific studies of any kind, any sort of book writing and graphic design. Many of these are part of America&#39;s contribution to the world and if we throw that into the trash by allowing mass-generation on a sub-par level, it will greatly decrease profits to American companies in the long run and weaken the US dollar in general. You are cutting off your nose to spite your face if you allow AI generated content to have the protections of copyright for immediate sales as companies such as Netflix and Disney continue to weaken as they rely on them instead of human knowledge and creativity. You know how you have those reCAPTCHA things on the bottom of this form? Those are going to get a whole lot worse if this is allowed.
