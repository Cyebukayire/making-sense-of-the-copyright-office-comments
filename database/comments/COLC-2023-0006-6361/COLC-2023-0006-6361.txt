As a published author I strenuously oppose any attempt to grant copyright status to material generated by artificial intelligence.  Such material has been &#39;scraped&#39; or otherwise taken (stolen is the appropriate word) from existing material that was created by human minds.  Any copyright recognition to AI-generated material would condone outright theft of previously copyrighted works that is then regurgitated in an altered form.  This is thievery, plain and simple.
