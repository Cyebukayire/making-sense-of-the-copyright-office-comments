Hello, Copyright Office Committee on the AI copyrights.<br/><br/>I am placing my comment as part of the AI artist using Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and other tools to create our artwork. We must receive copyright protection as our creative works are our own. It was stated by the copyright office that using AI is unpredictable and lacks the human hand of innovative development, which is utterly nonsense as it suggests that through a press of a button, &quot;art is made.&quot; This is not the case, and as an AI Artist working with these tools for the last year and a half, I would like to clarify this misconception.<br/><br/>To begin, these tools require not only prompt base commands but must also be curated and edited ((usually within the software)) to match the ideal principles of the Creative, which in turn demonstrates that a human hand is making the art ideal to their creative vision. This goes further with additional tools within the AI software, like LoRAs / Lycoris, which tune the generative instrument to a direct image focal, ControlNet editing physical pose and overall details of the idea to be ideal to the artist, and not to mention the actual Model / Hypernetwork that is tailored to the perfect styles that the AI Artist is intuned with. Again, these things demonstrate that human actions are committed to creating a digital illustration, not just gestured towards or button pressed, but the human effort to gear the image to a creative ideal.<br/><br/>Some of my associates within the AI Art field have also felt that the comparison between AI image generation and photography is more closely aligned for copyright discussions. To quote one of those AI Artists, &quot;There is an emphasis that AI image generation isn&#39;t much different taking a photo with a digital camera. Much of the same issues of copyright apply to both. After all, taking a photo also uses a machine to generate an image. Photos are copyrighted, and so should AI images for the same reasons: the selection of a tool, its settings, the subject, etc., are all chosen by humans. Generating an AI image is no more &quot;just entering a prompt&quot; than taking a photo is &quot;just pressing a button.&quot;<br/><br/>More emphasis should be put on comparing AI image generation to drawing an image by hand when it&#39;s an entirely different process. The AI is no more similar to a human artist than a camera is identical to a human artist.&quot; (AI Artist Pagnarok)<br/><br/>Furthering this quote, the committee has overlooked the nature of human creativity with digital art tools. We not only digital paint by hand, but we also use large amounts of editing software that do not require hand motion; these can be color edits, textures, and even some animation tools that are not dictated towards physical action but creative methodologies.<br/><br/>This, in turn, furthers the need for AI images to be given copyright protections for the Creative, as AI is a tool for the creative, and using these tools will continue to allow them to remain competitive and in synch with trends of the artist world. As an AI Artist, I strongly emphasize reconsidering the initial commentary given about these tools being random and uncontrollable; they are predictable, flawed, and, much like a photographer, depend heavily on the Creative Self to guide the outcome of the image in full.
