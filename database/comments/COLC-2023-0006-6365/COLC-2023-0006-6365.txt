As a U.S Citizen myself who has been drawing for over nearly 20 years of my lifetime making me a digital artist and illustrator, my opinion on AI art is that it&#39;s a huge massive disrespect to art and artists and that it should be made illegal. I am against AI art because it&#39;s clearly art theft. Thousands if not probably millions of artists worldwide has got their art stolen without their explicit consent and has been used to train AI models, reproducing a huge amount of stolen work in them. Not only that, dead artists artworks would also get stolen and AI artists will make a living out from stealing their works for AI which infuriates me greatly. Some artists nowadays aren&#39;t able to get a job either due to more hiring of AI artists becoming frequent and the people that are hiring AI artists don&#39;t seem to realize how this is actually very harmful. As for copyright and AI, anything created by AI does NOT deserve to be protected because again, AI has already stolen thousands if not millions of artists artworks as well as voice actors voices worldwide. After so much damage that has been done to the artist / creative communities, AI should not continue to strive. I do not want AI to be the future. REAL hardworking human artists deserves way much better, we put all effort and love into our creations we make, making it genuine and real. AI art on the other hand is only made by people who can&#39;t draw and are lazy, they always rely on stealing other people&#39;s artworks / voices / writing, making it empty and soul-less. From the bottom of my heart, please support real humans that can create.
