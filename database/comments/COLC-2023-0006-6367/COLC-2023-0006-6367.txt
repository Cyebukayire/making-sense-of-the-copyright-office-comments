Artificial intelligence needs to be regulated if is to continue being used. A lot of the material that is being used to train AI is stolen material scraped from online resources without the explicit permission / consent of the original creator, user, publisher, etc. this includes materials such as writing, art, images, and sometimes private information without the option to opt in or out of having such information be used in that way. If programmers want material to train their AI, they must obtain licensing and compensate the original sources in order to use it for their machine learning. AI also shouldn&rsquo;t directly interfere / cause the loss of jobs especially within the creative field. If these conditions can not be met, than AI shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to be used.<br/><br/>Other comments: I really hate what AI has done to art communities.
