Creating stronger copyright laws to protect artists from AI will not work. Copyright law only benefits corporations and has rarely ever helped independent artists. As you can see from Adobe&#39;s recent actions, they are currently trying to increase the power of copyright at the direct expense of the most dedicated users of their platform, who are mainly artists who sell their work to survive. This will not help any artists, it will only make it harder for them to work. It isn&#39;t in Adobe&#39;s interest to stop AI from &quot;stealing artists&#39; work&quot;. Nor does any massive corporation. To actually protect artists, there needs to be a new system that protects independent creators and artists and gives them just as much (if not more) power over their own art as any corporation, or AI needs to be regulated in a way that the data it&#39;s being trained on is given freely and knowingly by the creators. Making stronger copyright will hurt all artists.
