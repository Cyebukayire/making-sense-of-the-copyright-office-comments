We&#39;re mocked, undervalued, underpaid, exploited, but society would be nothing without artists. You need us to make cartoons, movies, shows, to make signs and murals, to paint portraits and to illustrate stories. We are in museums, we are famous, we inspire awe, because of the ways we communicate ideas and concepts and history through our love for our craft. If you do not do something to protect us from algorithms that steal our work and mold it into amalgamate slop, our society will: 1) destroy jobs and increase the unhoused population, 2) be flooded by visuals without intent, thought, or expertise behind them, gutting the national culture and what made America the envied and awe-inspiring leader of the world&#39;s storytelling craft, 3) and probably seal the fate of the justice system&#39;s inability to admit visual or audio evidence due to inability to discern what is real or algorithmically generated falsehoods. Do the right thing. Protect artists and our society at large from thieves who would gut the world&#39;s culture for selfish profit.
