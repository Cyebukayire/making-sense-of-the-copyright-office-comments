I&#39;m a digital illustrator and full time writer for video games. Speaking as a business owner, I am concerned with the rate that AI is taking freelance jobs at all levels (entry through editorial) to churn out sub-par work based on copywritten material both from big companies and smaller creators (whether it be writing, photography, or illustration). Studio work and characters should not be legally replicated by anyone just smart enough to search &quot;do this copywritten character in this studio&#39;s style&quot; to then profit off of; jobs intending to emulate a style or character should go to the original copywrite holders. Speaking as a creative, I&#39;m appalled that AI art &quot;trained&quot; on another creator&#39;s works would be afforded the same protection as an individual or studio&#39;s actual original creations. AI is stealing work that creators have honed over a lifetime of expensive schooling and countless hours of practice not only for a fraction of the price, but for a regurgitated fraction of the talent and quality. No amount of &quot;clever&quot; keyword fine-tuning in these AI programs could possibly equate to the amount of time, effort, and passion put in by real artists. My comment may be anecdotal, but it reflects the feelings of artists across all disciplines whom I&#39;ve spoken with in person, in online spaces, and through existing articles and social media posts that this committee is no doubt aware of. I urge you to consider, profoundly, what protecting these AI works says to both established studios and artists who&#39;s livelihoods are now being threatened by cheaper, lesser-quality work, and to newer creators just getting their start in the industry.
