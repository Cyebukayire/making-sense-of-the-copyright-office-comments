AI can be a useful tool. It can be used to speed up productivity, help with things like photo bashing for references or coming up with color palette ideas. But my work should not have been skimmed and added to AI databases without my permission. As an art student, I keep a digital portfolio on sites such as ArtStation and Instagram. When things such as midjourney AI became mainstream, my work was skimmed off of these websites and used in generative AI work. This was done without my knowledge or consent. AI platforms should have to follow the same copyright laws as other digital mediums, such as stock photo databases for editors and graphic designers. They pay for licenses to use the work, and the artists who originally made the work consented and offered their work to stock sites. There needs to be regulation to stop AI artists from stealing the work of others and profiting off of it.
