I think AI is an infringement of copyright as it takes data from every source whether protected or not, especially since people are also selling AI designs as if it were original content and not a collage of stolen content. I do not think AI should be able to be sold as something profitable, though I believe it could make a could tool for inspiration for artists but not as something that can be sold.
