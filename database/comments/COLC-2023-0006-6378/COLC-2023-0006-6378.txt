I do not feel AI generated creative works can be copyrighted. The works themselves are not created by a human. Rather they are a rearrangement of existing pieces of work (often copyright protected themselves and used as source data without permission). An AI can only replicate what it has been given. The only piece potentially copyrightable ought to be the code behind the machine learning or the process to assemble data. But creatively derived works are not unique content that furthers humanity or the arts.
