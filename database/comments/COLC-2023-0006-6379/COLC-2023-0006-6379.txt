Hello, I am a literature student and artist and I am concerned with unregulated AI because of threats to copyrights and livelihoods. This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little to no recourse. Reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. This is common sense. Additionally, regulations could help us ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.
