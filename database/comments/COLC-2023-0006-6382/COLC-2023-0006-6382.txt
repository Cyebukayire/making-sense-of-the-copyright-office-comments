AI art is inherently theft. It asks no consent of the original artist and can and has been used to steal specific works from artists and not just use them for machine learning. Many colleges and institutions ban AI such as Chat GPT due to plagiarism and other forms of art and expression should be considered the same. People&#39;s voices are being stolen, which leads to unethical business practices in the name of cost cutting. Music is being plagiarized. It is not being used for artistic expression, it is being used as a shortcut to avoid hiring people with actual skills while providing sub-par results. While not a legal issue, the glee I see with AI users when they steal something is disturbing on an ethical and moral level.<br/>Artists need more power to control and protect their works in regard to this blatant theft.<br/>Thank you
