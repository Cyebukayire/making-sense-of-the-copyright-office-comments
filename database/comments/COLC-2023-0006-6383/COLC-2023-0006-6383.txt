AI generated content severely devalues authentic human created art, skill, &amp; work when used in creative fields such as TV, books, movies, video games, etc. This technology is a danger to the millions of people who work &amp; wish to work in the variety of creative industries out there. These people&#39;s jobs are currently as risk of becoming defunct as a result of this exploitative AI technology. These hardworking people are the ones whose hard work is being nonconsensually taken to train these databases in the first place with no financial compensation to said hardworking people from the companies who stole from them. We&#39;re already seeing a whole new type of scam operations &amp; false news pop up as a result of this technology. Anyone who doesn&#39;t know to question what they see on the internet will easily become victim to the people who wish to prey on their naivety.<br/><br/>As someone who wishes to work in the creative industry, the work created by people NEED to be protected in online spaces. When someone uploads an image, an audio file, a video, or any writing, it NEEDS to automatically be protected from AI training being able to train off of the work the second it successfully uploads online. Platforms that wish to train their own AI databases NEED to automatically have user settings for AI training on their work set to &quot;Opt out&quot; instead of being unfairly automatically set to &quot;Opt in.&quot; This way, those who are inactive online, or the works of the deceased are automatically protected from being used to train AI databases since the deceased cannot consent, &amp; anyone who is unaware cannot consent either. <br/><br/>There needs to be massive fines for any company or individual who manages to train their AI database on a work that either someone has explicitly stated that they do not consent to AI training from their work or managed to train their AI off of a protected piece. The money from these fines should go towards the author whose work was illegally taken for AI training, as a means of personal damage costs.<br/><br/>No amount of AI usage (especially if the AI database uses stolen work from authors who did not consent to their work being used to train the AI) in a work should be allowed to be copyrighted. A work should be at least 95% human made in order to be eligible for copyright. The Copyright Law should be updated to clarify that human authorship is required in order to make something eligible for copyright.<br/><br/>ALL AI generated works, or works that incorporate AI in some way, should be legally required to clarify that the work was made with AI &amp; isn&#39;t 100% human made. Any movie, video game, book, TV show, etc being marketed should be legally required to clarify that it was made with AI in all of its marketing in a way that is easy to understand &amp; was clearly communicated to the public &amp; isn&#39;t some hidden away, extremely small text at the end of the advertisement, but as something that has to be verbally read aloud in the advertisement &amp; can be clearly read on billboards, posters, etc. The company/companies producing the work should be the ones held responsible for clarifying to the public that a particular work they&#39;ll be releasing was made with AI technology. The consequences for not properly labeling that a work was made with AI should be a several million dollar fine for failing to be honest with the public. <br/><br/>I very much hope that the works of millions of people will be protected &amp; these companies who are stealing from the working class will be held accountable very soon.
