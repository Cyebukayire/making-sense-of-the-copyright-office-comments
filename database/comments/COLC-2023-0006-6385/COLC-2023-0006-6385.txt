This AI trend should be illegal. It steals work from artists and writers and steals people&#39;s likenesses and voices for the AI user&#39;s personal gain. There needs to be serious laws about this stuff or we&#39;re going to be in deep trouble. What&#39;s to stop an AI user from making a video where the president declares war on a country? Nothing. They can just do that. People&#39;s livelihoods are in danger because of this thing. There are strikes happening right now in Hollywood because the writers and actors overwhelmingly hate this strike. With potential more potential strikes along the way. A cesspit of stale, bland lack of creativity and misinformation is on the horizon if AI is not stopped right now. The only people who gain from this are corporations are lazy and people waiting to blackmail and spread misinformation to use this. And it&#39;s bleeding more and more into our daily lives.<br/>www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/student-accused-ai-cheating-turnitin-1234747351/amp/<br/>https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/06/08/lawyer-used-chatgpt-in-court-and-cited-fake-cases-a-judge-is-considering-sanctions/<br/>This is getting more and more dangerous and it needs to stop.
