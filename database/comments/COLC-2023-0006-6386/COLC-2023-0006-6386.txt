Copyright is not the right framework for regulating AI generated materials, and it would only harm copyright law in the long run to try and shoehorn AI into its framework. Counterintuitively AIs do not make or store copies of the material they are trained on.  They can generate anyone&#39;s face not because they have a copy of everyone&#39;s face, but because they have the information about everyone&#39;s face in an abstract mathematical form. We need a different framework, perhaps &quot;rights of reference&quot; that are needed for training, but extending copyright to this will only break and serve no one. There is also the issue of harm. Copyright protection is to serve as an incentive to create. So far no humans&#39; work is actually being harmed by AI generated material. Most of the harmful effects of AI on human creators is imaginary. People can imagine it harming creators, but there is no actual verifiable evidence of it harming a specific individual. Creators may not be happy with AI generated material similar to their own, but other than their pride, they have not been harmed. On the contrary, creators are using AIs daily to help them generate new ideas, to act as interns in their own work, and to serve as a brand new medium. If copyright is stretched to try and prevent this, it will diminish the power and legitimacy of copyright to protect actual copies.   &mdash; Kevin Kelly, co-founder Wired magazine
