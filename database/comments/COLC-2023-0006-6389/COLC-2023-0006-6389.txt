I am a cinematographer working in the film, television and commercials industry. AI-generated imagery serves as a direct threat to my skillset and livelihood. If this is indeed our future, though, at the very least it seems only logical and fair that this technology have to adhere to copyright laws, and distribute reasonable compensation to the artists whose images the software is trained on. Diffusion model AI software cannot exist without relying on a hefty dataset of pre-existing imagery; and the artists who created that imagery and have copyright over the original images should at the very least be compensated for each use of the software that would not be able to function without them. I hope the US Copyright Office will act in order to protect artists and their rights over their own intellectual property in this ever-evolving world.
