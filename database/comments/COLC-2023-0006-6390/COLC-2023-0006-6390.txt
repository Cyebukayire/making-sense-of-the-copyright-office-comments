The use of generative AI for text and art creation is no different than the use of calculators and computers for math, text or art creation. Generative AI is a tool, like Photoshop or Microsoft Word. It is barely different from Grammerly or any other grammar and spell checker. <br/><br/>It is just the application of deep statistical analysis to language. The input is a string of numbers (dressed up as words). The output is a string of numbers (dressed up as words). Insofar as the input string, the prompt, is relatively unique, it produces a relatively unique output. To the extent that the output of a statistical analysis routine can be copyrighted, then generative AI output can be copyrighted. But, to what degree can anyone copyright the output of an SPSS program? Because that&#39;s all generative AI is... it&#39;s just a sophisticated, applied SPSS routine.
