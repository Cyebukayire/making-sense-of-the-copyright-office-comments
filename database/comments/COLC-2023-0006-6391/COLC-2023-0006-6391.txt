Video games create NPCs through the use of AI, that is coded and that is acceptable so I could see the draw for why people would want to take AI one step further and have them simulate the whole shabang. Right now, it&#39;s believable enough to be real but it also has room for improvement. A lot of the illustrations I see, I can instantly spot because of how AI stylizes, most people use the same tools, therefore, try to replicate what is before them. This includes already licensed properties, take the YouTube channel Corridor Digital for example. They created an animation using live action footage and overlaying animation on top. This isn&#39;t an unknown practice and is used quite frequently but their usage is something else entirely, AI. The process used existing footage from an anime movie known as Vampire Hunter D and modified it. Is it right to trace over someone else&#39;s work?<br/><br/>Rather than someone taking &#39;inspiration&#39; from the art that they see, AI consumes it en masse and prints out what it found to be common among what it was trained to study. Should people be treated the same? Have an AI read a book then streamline the plot points to us? A lot is skimmed over that way, subtleties, character progression, flaws. That&#39;s why art isn&#39;t just a visual medium. I&#39;m a writer myself and have spent years working on books and screenplays, trying to make the cut with my stories. But if AI is introduced then my chances will be lost, not because people will be busy reading quality products in turn, but because the sheer quantity of AI will flood the gates so that the people who passion over their work are drowned out.<br/><br/>This affects even more than what&#39;s written and outputted visually though too. With every VGA cable, comes the A, Audio. There&#39;s a 2004 TV movie by the name of &#39;Pixel Perfect&#39; about a struggling band that decides to use an AI singer. There&#39;s a part where the AI singer presents the lyrics for her new song &quot;Loretta, these are just lines from other songs.&quot; to which she says &quot;Yeah, but I&#39;ve put them all together.&quot; and the guy she&#39;s talking to says &quot;Loretta, you can&#39;t just take bits and pieces of other songs.&quot; &quot;Why not? You made me out of bits and pieces of other people.&quot; And the two characters argue over how that&#39;s any different. The thing is, there isn&#39;t a right answer.<br/><br/>Autotune is a thing that modulates your voice, why wouldn&#39;t AI be considered the same? Different questions can have similar answers, because it replicates a voice. Who&#39;s voice is it replicating? If a song were to use my voice, shouldn&#39;t I be compensated? I didn&#39;t do the work, but that is a part of my personal character, something nobody would&#39;ve known if I didn&#39;t exist. I should at least have to give my permission. What if they continue to do it after I&#39;ve passed and can no longer give permission? It&#39;s not my work and I can&#39;t take credit for it yet someone else can. Some even use others likeness with Deepfake tech, this is dangerous and I themed one of my college finals on this in 2019. Say someone posts a video of the president or future candidate but it&#39;s not really them. There are people out there to investigate that but you only make their job harder. Careers have been destroyed because of much worse. I mean the Howard Dean scream pushed him from the race, looking back on it now, it&#39;s so much simpler than the things you see today. What about a death threat made with AI? But should it be copyrighted, it only makes things messier.<br/><br/>I believe that should the AI be programmed by the user, it may be used by that said user within legal parameters. This is already a grey area because say a company commissions an AI to do this job for the company. Then all that money funnels because an AI is doing the work. All it took was a one-time small fee for a programmer to create it. I don&#39;t see this as morally right therefore I&#39;d keep it out of a professional setting and keep the technology strictly personal. I believe, in a way, this should allow for whoever to create this program, to be able to copyright it, for use and deterrent from replication, not for sale. Should a union be formed by all this, by all means.<br/><br/>This has an impact on my daily life, as I am an avid art fan and the internet acts as a museum of sorts but it irks me to see that my feed is now flooded with AI pictures and a lot of sites aren&#39;t prepared to filter them. I&#39;m not asking to gate-keep art or expression from people. But I ask that abuse be kept out of the landscape. If someone can pump out 5-10 works a day, then it&#39;ll be harder for people to settle on my one a week. I have a job, I only have so much free time to use and I like to use it creating, I choose that whether I get paid or not, but why should I not be recognized for that effort. I like to recognize the human behind the work, putting an AI between that will only leave the creator in the dust. Who will people recognize over time? Let me ask this, why is there a reCaptcha? TO FIGHT AI AND BOTS!
