AI systems must be heavily regulated to protect the future jobs and income of real, human workers. Works produced by generative systems are purely derivative and based on work by human writers, artists, and other creatives. These human workers have not in any case been compensated for their contribution, nor in most cases have these works even been requested for use. AI systems profit off of work done by human creatives, many of whom already live in or near poverty lines. Allowing AI systems to profit off of what they produce puts money squarely in the hands of very few people (those who own these systems and businesses related to them) and removes so much potential income needed for survival from real people.<br/><br/>These systems also would not exist without the creatives whose work has been nonconsensually scraped to make them.<br/><br/>At minimum, we need laws in place that keep material produced by AI from being copyrighted. <br/><br/>Works by human creatives MUST be protected. In all other cases, use of work produced by human creatives has been protected by copyright and subject to any commercial use requiring LICENSING. This should be no different. <br/><br/>AI datasets MUST provide transparent information on what content they have been trained on, where it was obtained, and ensuring that it contains no personal information that could endanger, disenfranchise, or otherwise expose those it was taken from. <br/><br/>Criminal and otherwise untoward use of AI technology MUST be punished to the fullest extent permitted. <br/><br/>The following examples are things we have already seen result from access to unrestricted generative systems:<br/><br/>- generated images submitted to job applications, contests, scholarships, etc. Removing opportunity from those who have worked hard to have their work known and be compensated for it.<br/><br/>- generative chat and writing systems used as news sources, or to write articles, drive search engines etc. These systems have no way to fact check information provided, resulting in misleading and outright untrue content. This undermines the integrity of information available, as well as removing job opportunities from real writers, journalists, etc. <br/><br/>- generative systems have been used to &quot;deepfake&quot; appearances of public figures, politicians, and celebrities, as well as their voices. This not only removes opportunity for paid actors to receive any compensation for appearances or voice work, but it also puts us as a society in an incredibly dangerous position where the public will be unable to trust news sources, and whether or not any figure in power has truly said or done the things they see. <br/><br/>I have worked as a creative professional for 15 years, and things have now become so troubling that something must change.<br/><br/>All media sources which make use of AI technology must clearly and visibly state it on all affected websites, articles, videos, text, etc.<br/><br/>All AI frameworks must have clear and transparent documentation on what information their datasets were trained on.<br/><br/>Work created with AI technology must NOT be protected by copyright. There is room here for flexibility. See: music sampling laws. Alternatively, requiring any AI-produced work to be altered by a human creative to a certain extent (ie 70 to 80% altered by volume of content) in order to obtain a copyrightable result.
