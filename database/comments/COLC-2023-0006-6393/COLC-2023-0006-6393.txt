I&#39;m an artist. Seeing the recent developments of AI has been scary. It&#39;s already challenging enough making a living as an artist as it is. If they want to have AI generate some images, that&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t use art without the authors&#39; consent. <br/><br/>AI image generation is meant for profit and to replace artists. What do you think would compel someone to choose art as a career, one that doesn&#39;t pay well and has projects being cancelled left and right because some CEO decided they weren&#39;t profitable enough? Why would anyone want to be an artist if not for love of our craft? Now they want take that away from us too? Stealing our style and replacing us?<br/><br/>I&#39;m from Brazil, I don&#39;t know how much weight what I write could have in the decision making of US legislation, but I&#39;m sure you understand how important this is not just for your country, but for everyone else too.<br/><br/>Please regulate AI so it has to be developed responsibly and respectfully to artists, writers, actors and any who may be impacted.
