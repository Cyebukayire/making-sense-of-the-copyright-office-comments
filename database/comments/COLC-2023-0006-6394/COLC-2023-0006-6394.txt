Hello my name is Willie Stewart and in terms of copyright I believe that using book to train ai is fair use. It may not be human but don&rsquo;t we also learn by reading. Also on the topic of who owns ai art . I think the person who made the prompt deserves some ownerships of what&rsquo;s produced . You gave it the idea and received something . Also style has long been  something that is part of fair use as long as <br/>your not claiming you are the person who came up with the style. I get it everyone&rsquo;s afraid of being replaced by it. <br/><br/>The reason for that is we have no system in place to support those that are displaced. If ai advances enough (it will) . We&rsquo;re going to have to come up with new things for people to do and that&rsquo;s ok.
