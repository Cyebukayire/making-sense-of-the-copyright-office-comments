I don&#39;t have much of a formal statement planned here but as an artist I feel compelled to participate. AI generated images, and to an extent text, are a form of theft, plain and simple. There isn&#39;t really any escaping the fact that each of these engines works by being fed the work of actual people, so it may later be chopped into tiny pieces and stitched back together. Now, some of these services claim that the input they train their engines on was given voluntarily, but even big names like Adobe have been caught with their hand in someone else&#39;s pocket, with users being able to prompt their engine to create works in the style of well known artists that are suspiciously similar to original works, despite these artists never voluntarily offering up their pieces for the program. So simply, you wouldn&#39;t allow a plagiarized work to be copywritten, would you? An authorless one?
