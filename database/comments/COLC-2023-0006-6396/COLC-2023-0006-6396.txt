I speak the following from the perspective of someone who has worked for years to be an artist and a writer.<br/><br/>Art is not simply &quot;this thing that I can look at&quot;. Instead, art is the product of passion, imagination, and skill. You can have any amount of these three elements in your work, but so long as all three are present, what you have created is art.<br/>Artificial intelligence has none of these three elements. They are lines of code, and have no passion. They have no imagination, only the ability to do what they are told. And they have no skill, just data to input and output.<br/>Worse, AI does not actually generate anything new. Rather, it is &quot;trained&quot; using images created by actual artists, and incorporates bits and bobs. This is theft.<br/>And, ultimately, the person who entered the prompts for the AI to use (i.e., the orders given) is not an artist. They do not put in any passion, imagination, or skill. The image or text or whatever is generated, is created entirely without any work on the user&#39;s part.<br/><br/>Perhaps someday, when artificial intelligence has advanced to the point that it can create its own works from scratch, we can call that AI an artist, and the works they produce &quot;art&quot;. But that&#39;s not where we are now. Right now, all we have is a tool for cheating.
