GenAI outputs trained on data 2ithout consent is immoral, dangerous and threatens the labour of creators.<br/><br/>We do not consent do having our work stolen and regurgitated into something we did not make.<br/><br/>Uncontrolled, the jobs of millions of creators will be lost, replaced for a system that required their labour. This stifles creativity and whilst some companies make some short term gains there will be no demand for the swamp of low effort content. Freelance workers are currently suffering from damages in the form of lost opportunities due to being unable to compete with stolen data mashed into new images at a speed and scale that people cannot work at. <br/><br/>The creators are not compensated for their labour when their work is ingested by scrapers for GenAI. Since the GenAI was dependant on this work to produce an output this should require the explicit permission of the original author.<br/><br/>Scale is not often cosidered in copyright. If you could copy a piece of work and generate massive numbers of work to out compete the original author using their own work then the work is not sufficiently protected. As GenAI works are not genuine works of the author but use samples of their data this should be considered as a type of illegitimate copying especially when marketing the GenAI product with the authors name (e. g. &#39;in the style of&#39;).<br/><br/>Whilst &#39;style&#39; is a concept that cannot be copyrighted, it should be considered as part of brand. Marketing your product as &#39;in the style of&#39; someone who has not consented to have their works used should be considered infringement as no agreement was formed. This is not much different to stealing copyrighted images to print onto a shirt and  sell, but again the scale makes dealing with this infringement more difficult. <br/><br/>Any kind of GenAI training should be in the form of a &#39;donatable&#39; submission explicitly from the author of work. If this cannot be proven the the GenAI should be forced to destroy their dataset and pay for damages.<br/><br/>Finally GenAI has damaging effects outside of copyright interests, including the production of generated obscene material i. e. Child pornography, disinformation, contributing to climate change by processing huge amounts of we scraped images needlessly, as well as being encouraging illigitimate businesses. Applying appropriate copyright for GenAI will heavily discourage the above.
