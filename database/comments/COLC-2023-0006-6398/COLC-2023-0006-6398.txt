I do not believe that AI has any claim to copyright. AI is forced to derive all of its output from other sources. AI cannot draw, it simply copies an artist until it comes to the answer of best fit. AI cannot think for itself, so it cannot parody or have inspiration. AI work should then be credited to the sources that the AI is tapping into in my opinion. We do not credit Google for the links it provides because it is only the middleman. AI is simply another middleman.
