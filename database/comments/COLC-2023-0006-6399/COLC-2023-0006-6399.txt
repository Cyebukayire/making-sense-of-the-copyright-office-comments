As an artist, I am disheartened by the use of AI to replace me and my fellow humans in this field. AI may be fast and free, but it cannot create with intelligence, which is a fundamental part of the work i do. all it does is look at the work human artists have done, and copy aspects of that without any form of creativity or any thought behind the decisions it makes. when i create art, every single thing i do requires a creative decision with thought behind it. yes, i could pick a color everyone else uses, but then where&rsquo;s the thought? the color everyone else uses adds no meaning to my own piece, because everyone else is working in different contexts than me. AI has almost no human input, and therefore cannot make important creative decisions. all of the important creative decisions are coming from artists from whom the AI steals, and those artists aren&rsquo;t working within the same context the ai is working from. the ai simply takes their decisions and passes them off as it&rsquo;s own, which is plagiarism. i don&rsquo;t know the exact details of how to stop ai, all i know is that it existing in the state it&rsquo;s in means it is plagiarizing and breaking the copyright of the artists from which it steals. perhaps ai artworks should only sample artworks and pieces that are public domain, or that the owner of the ai has the rights to. then, perhaps, artists will be given a choice in the matter on whther their work is used for ai.
