Hi, I am a working Product Designer/Graphic Designer and the unchecked power of generative AI concerns me. <br/><br/>A few years ago I found my LinkedIn profile photo and images from my online design portfolio stolen and uploaded to a European stock photo site with my name still attached for sale. I did my best to find and contact the server host and report the matter but nothing could really be done, and it&#39;s likely they&#39;re still for sale. <br/><br/>This matters because generative AI relies on the input of data to learn how to generate what you want. I know I am not the only working creative with stolen work falsely put up for sale. An AI developer may think they are legally purchasing work they can feed into the algorithm if traceability like signatures or previous copyright information has been scrubbed. As a working class American and a young woman whose unlicensed-for-creative-use photo will likely be used for catfishing scams at some point, I would like to see the government do more to protect our data.<br/><br/>Allowing generative AI art to be copyrighted is concerning because even if the developer is doing their best to be transparent about their data set, there is still a significant likelihood that data was previously stolen.<br/><br/>Our livelihoods, identity, and personal safety is at risk. We are all more online than ever and it is so easy to steal photos, videos, and voice clips from the internet and use it to train AI. As a tool, generative AI can be very helpful in exploring creative solutions, but unchecked it becomes an easy tool for people to steal work and call it their own. <br/><br/>Creatives rely on easy ways to share examples of their craft to gain clients. The current environment feels like we can expect our work to be stolen with no consequences unless you have a massive platform or access to strong legal resources. An average American like me wants to see my government take steps to protect the average American
