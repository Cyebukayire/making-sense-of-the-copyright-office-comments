If AI is basically scraping the internet for content and basically rearranging it to answer questions/use it as a language model, it isn&#39;t creating anything new. It can only create a Frankenstein monster out of what&#39;s already in existence, much of which is copyrighted and probably was not compensated for this use (or worse, used without permission). I believe allowing AI-generated material to be copyrighted at this point could cause lawsuits because there&#39;s no way to prove that the work IS original, or where it came from -- where the source was scraped, where the language model or art derived from, regardless of how &quot;original&quot; the prompt claimed to be.
