Generative AI is made and tailored to copy the works and styles of well known companies and individuals who have no consent, knowledge, or control of what their work is being used for. If generative AI is not regulated companies would be able to not only plagiarize from each other but from unknowing individuals who have unwillingly had their work scraped from them and also be the result of many lawsuits. It also invades privacy by taking images not meant to be seen publicly and uses them for its data training. Said images can be sensitive, inappropriate, or dangerous. It can also be used to spread misinformation easily by generating fake images and texts to well populated websites like Facebook or YouTube.
