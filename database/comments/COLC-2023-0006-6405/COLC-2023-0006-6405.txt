When it comes to art, &quot;A.I. technology&quot; would be impossible without unethical data scraping. Millions of artists and creators (both alive and dead) have had their art fed to various &quot;A.I. models&quot; without their consent. Technology that relies on these methods should never be protected under copyright law in any way. As a professional storyboard artist that has worked at several major studios, I believe these data-scraping methods should be considered large-scale theft and prosecuted as such. They pose an existential threat to the livelihoods of millions of creators and the future of art.
