I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in this topic and its request for public feedback. I am an artist whose living depends on my being able to monetize my work, as well as a supporter of other authors and artists, as I recognize that it is important in a democratic society to support the creation of art. <br/>The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.&nbsp; This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.&nbsp; Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright. <br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/>Thank you for considering these comments.
