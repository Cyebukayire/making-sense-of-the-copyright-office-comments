To whom it may concern,<br/>As a US Citizen who enjoys writing and reading in my free time, I feel strongly that copyright should only be able to held by human writers. In this age, &quot;AI&quot; programs that create written works are doing so by having been fed many, many human-composed pieces of writing and using that to predict what the most likely set of words would be when given a prompt. This is not creative -- it is simply replicating a likely option from what already exists. Crucially, it also does not have an author -- it has millions of authors, everyone who was ever written something that trained the program. No matter what the programmer may claim, they are not the author and have little to nothing to with individual outputs of their program. As such, their is no author who created the work and thus no author who can or should be protected by copyright law.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Benjamin Lowry
