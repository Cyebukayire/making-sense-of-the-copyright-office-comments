As an illustrator I believe AI generated images to be a) falsely presented as the &ldquo;AI&rdquo; programs on the market are machine learning and not true artificial intelligence, and b) infringe on the copyrights of the artists whose works were used without permission to train their models. Furthermore, they are often presented with an intent to deceive audiences into thinking these works were made by human hands. Clearly there is an intrinsic value in art made by human hands that these AI-users are conscious of and wish to emulate without putting in the time and effort to learn our crafts. If they want art that looks like ours, they should have to pay us for it, instead of using these programs that scraped our work for data without our knowledge or consent, and the images they produce should not be able to be used for commercial purposes without full disclosure that they were produced using AI. I have seen AI used on book covers from major publishing houses, which is already a highly competitive industry. AI legitimately threatens the livelihoods of real, skilled human artists.
