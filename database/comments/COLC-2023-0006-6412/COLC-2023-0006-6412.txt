I&#39;m Yoalys Dur&aacute;n, artist, writer and illustrator. I think it&rsquo;s essential that the U.S. Copyright Office protects real human artists from the threat that is generative AI. AI companies are taking our work directly as material to train their AI so that it can replicate our labor. In a couple of seconds AI can produce hundreds of images. The process to create real human made art takes time, growth, emotion, and much more than just typing a prompt. Failing to protect artists can lead to our demise. Generative AI is not a tool, it&#39;s a replacement, it&#39;s already taking jobs and disrupting every creative industry. There&#39;s no way to compete against something so powerful. We artists need your support. Please, protect human artists. For most of us, art is our only income, our only hope.
