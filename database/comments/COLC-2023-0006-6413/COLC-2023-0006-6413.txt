See attached file(s)<br/><br/>To allow AI to use creative pieces/man-made pieces without explicit permission from the author(s), is inherently unethical, and in many cases, illegal.  There is no ethical version of AI unconsensually using the authors&#39; creative content- especially not for any type of income or commercial purpose.  It is infringement of the creator&#39;s rights, to use without knowing explicit permission from the authors.<br/><br/>The constitutional justification for this blatant copyright is to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts.&quot;<br/><br/>Not only does the practice discourage artists, but promotes the unethical practices of taking a targeted artist&#39;s work and copying directly off of them in a technological format, without a human touch and human effort behind the piece itself.  A person may choose to study artworks themselves, and create pieces based off of their learned works- but this, as long as it is done in honest will, will result in a type of style unique to each person, and an effort ethically able to gain money from.  The AI is being used to harass creators and use their works for profit, with no human effort or touch behind the technological process.  It is living off the backs of people that work hard to develop skills, earned typically over years of labor, without their permission or compensation.<br/><br/>Sites that have tried to protect artists and writers from AI copyright are still preyed upon- more often than not, for profit only.  Merge a few artworks (without the creators permission), paste, get money- all it takes are a few clicks.  In no way is this an ethical practice.  It takes revenue from the artist&#39;s hard-earned works and skill, in a lazy, unconsensual, and frankly disgusting way.<br/><br/>&quot;The educational exceptions&quot; for the AI are being blatantly ignored by many, if not most.<br/><br/>It hurts me deeply, personally, and makes me fear posting any creative content made by my own hand.  It would feel terrible to see any part of it being used for revenue somewhere else without my permission, and discourage any hand-made creative processes further.  <br/><br/>I can see AI encouraging creative people and others as a whole, but not without respecting the authors, the hard work and talent it comes from, behind everything being generated, and firmly implementing the grounds in which it is appropriate to use such works.<br/><br/>Please implement creator/author consent to all these AI&#39;s.  As long as there is explicit and knowing consent from each individual author/creator, we can hope to not discourage the actual artists, and maintain the baseline of respect and ethics that should&#39;ve always been there, while still feeding the learning algorithms.<br/><br/>Any unconsensual generative/scraping/other AI made for/including creative works, that isn&#39;t truly being used in (or directly supporting the ethical grounds of) the good will of the original authors of works being scraped, should be firmly illegal.<br/><br/>I truly hope this can change something.
