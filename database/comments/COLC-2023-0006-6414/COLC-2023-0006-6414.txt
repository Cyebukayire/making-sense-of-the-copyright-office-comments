The problem I have with AI art and ChatGPT is that it copies the hard work from human artists and writers. There needs to be at least some restrictions so that creatives don&#39;t have to worry about getting their content stolen. Moreover, executives in the entertainment industry should hire real artists, writers and voice actors instead of relying on AI to do cheap work for them.
