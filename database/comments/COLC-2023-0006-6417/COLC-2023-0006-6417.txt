Ai is a soulless beast that threatens to destroy art as we know it. What good is a music artist if someone can plug their voice in and make them sing whatever they want. What good are actors if someone can put their face and voice on a puppet and make them perform. Ai is something new that we do not know the bounds of and if we let it just run free there&rsquo;s no telling what could happen.
