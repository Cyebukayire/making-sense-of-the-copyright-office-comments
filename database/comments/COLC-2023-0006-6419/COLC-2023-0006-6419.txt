Personally, I have found artificial intelligence does not perform even the basics of its name. AI is built not to think, but to warp the creativity of humans into what is statistically palatable to consumers. If a filmmaker were to create a movie by ripping ideas verbatim from independent creators and bundling them together into a creatively confused film, no court would consider that the filmmaker&#39;s work. As a member of a creative field, all AI is doing is mashing stolen ideas together and hoping nobody notices. If corporations are allowed to get rid of their creatives in favor of AI, we will soon live in a world where there is no originality, no differentiation, and no need for copyright in the first place because AI will simply use the data from previous projects to make a &quot;new&quot; project that is the same thing but slightly to the left.
