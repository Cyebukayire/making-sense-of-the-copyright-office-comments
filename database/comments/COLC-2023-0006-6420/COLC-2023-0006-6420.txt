As a preface, I am a staunch ANTI-AI artist. Big surprise, I know. Put simply, artists and their work should be protected by the government. If you guys can enforce petty patent protections, you guys can enforce this. AI-generated &quot;content&quot; (visual, auditory, etc.) should be strictly labeled as AI-generated and exempt from all forms of copyright protection. Throw the common folk a bone now and then instead of shafting them.
