In its current form, generative AI models cannot guarantee that they are not directly copying elements from copyrighted works in their training sets. This should certainly have legal repercussions. The only AI-generated work I would consider legally sound is one created with a model whose dataset verifiably contains only works from creators who have given consent to be used in AI training.
