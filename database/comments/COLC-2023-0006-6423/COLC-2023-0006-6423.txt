Rather than approaching this issue assuming AI systems and AI development is done with good intentions it&#39;s better to come from the other directions where AI systems being used with and developed for bad intentions. Most of us look at this new technology optimistically. But we must consider the havoc bad actors have been creating with technology such as online scamming, technology facilitating identity fraud,  and incessant &quot;robo callers&quot;. New affordable technologies in the hands of a tiny percentage of the population have created a nightmare for everyone. <br/><br/>The real issue isn&#39;t the issues that we can foresee but the issues we cannot. There&#39;s countless innovative ways bad actors will with 100% certainty use AI systems for nefarious purposes. And once more new technologies develop and used with AI systems this issue will only become far worse. <br/><br/>It&#39;s with this in mind that copyright material used by AI systems and used in their training should at a minimum come with at least a few restrictions. An example would be to require specifically free to access AI systems to cite a source if it was derived from copyright material as free and low cost AI systems will certainly be the main services used by bad actors.  For non free AI services citations could be available but more obfuscated as not to hinder the users experience but still accessible by those interested. <br/><br/>Specifically for the AI training aspect the individuals or organization doing the training should indeed at least own a copy of copyright material. Training an AI system should be viewed the same way as we view training individuals. A program that teaches individuals how to type tends to use works in the public domain. The only caveat however is that if the AI system being trained is open sourced or is indented to be a commercial product. An open sourced AI system should require less &quot;strings attached&quot; when using copyright material while commercial products should at minimum state what copyright works have been used which can be accessed by certain individuals outside the commercial organization.
