To put it simply, AI used to create art and music is theft. It&#39;s not genuinely creating anything new with its own sound, colors, or perspective. It analyzes and feeds off repeated patterns that have already been created. It cannot create anything without a database. That&#39;s why you need keywords and phrases, it finds these images linked to these words, and directly takes, tweaks, and copy-pastes the source material. You could compare it to making a collage, where you rip pieces of a magazine to make an entirely new composition, except all the pieces came from pictures of models, and you&#39;re trying to make a picture of a model, and claiming it to be just as authentic an original photo.<br/><br/>There are already different forms of AI that already exist to help creators create, and there is no problem with people using it with their own original art, music, and ideas. The issue is that when a vast amount of people use it, they are not building off they&#39;re own work, they are deliberately taking work from others, feeding it into their AI, and claiming that it is completely their own. They don&#39;t ask for permission. And these people do not even have the intention of creating because they truly want to create or like art. They&#39;re doing this for money because the process is quicker. You can even see that many of them have intentions against the original artists that they steal from. If you go on social media and find posts about how innovative AI art is, you&#39;ll find traces of negative opinions towards artists, many claims of &quot;stealing their jobs&quot; or that they have to go and get a &quot;real job.&quot; Which is true. If AI art is largely adopted by companies, this would be a major detriment to those in the industry. Like any industry, people have jobs. And in an industry where it can be difficult to find stability in one job alone, having AI take up these jobs does not help.
