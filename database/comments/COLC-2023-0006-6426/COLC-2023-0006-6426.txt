Hello. I am currently going to school for writing, and writing is a strenuous task, but seeing your own work pays off in the end. The way that AI is going, that feeling of being finished with your own work, will go away. That is merely on a personal level. People who enjoy writing, who would go into it as a job, will no longer have those jobs available. It will hurt the livelihoods of many people, and destroy creativity in people looking to write and dissuade people from writing. Please do not let this happen. Regulating this usage will protect copyright owners, and will save the creativity of future generations.
