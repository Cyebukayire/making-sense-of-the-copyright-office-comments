&quot;Artificial Intelligence,&quot; as currently branded though it is often nothing more than simple &quot;machine learning,&quot; does not only pose a threat to society but is CURRENTLY damaging our flow of information. Internet search results which would previously have garnered useful information written by humans now returns results cobbled together by machines, with no nuance or proper analysis, spreading misinformation. These programs steal not just from humans but from each other&#39;s garbled words as well, creating loops that will bastardize in everlasting loops the information these words PURPORT to provide. The hard work of real humans (artists, writers, researchers, journalists, and infinitely more) is stolen by corporations to be analyzed and sloppily recreated by programs no one has to pay. This is all driven by corporate greed. The products of &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; are already harming real people in measurable ways. Books &quot;written&quot; by &quot;AI&quot; are being sold by online retailers like Amazon. If this doesn&#39;t immediately alarm you, consider what KINDS of information are contained in these books - I have personally seen books on topics such as &quot;foraging food&quot; which contained misinformation about which foraged foods are safe to eat. Poisonous mushroom often have almost-identical edible counterparts. These books did NOT contain the truth, and instead suggested to readers that they should eat foraged items which UNDOUBTEDLY would lead to ill health once consumed. And this is just one example; &quot;copyright&quot; by law covers such an expansive range of products and ideas that it&#39;s impossible to exemplify them all in 5000 characters. But I, as a citizen of this country and as a human who cares about the health &amp; safety of other humans as well as the planet and the vast wealth of life sharing this planet alongside us, beg you not to write into law any protections for use of AI. The technology is NOT ready to replace humans in any capacity. &quot;Machine learning&quot; can only replicate what it has learned from the information it has been fed. It looks for commonalities and takes these as &quot;truth&quot; about the concepts it analyzes. This means that it takes every bias and increases it exponentially. The SAFEST thing would be to write into law that &quot;NO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR PRODUCTS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN BE USED COMMERCIALLY. IF FOUND APPLIED FOR COMMERCIAL USE, THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE WILL BE INVESTIGATED, THEIR OPERATIONS WILL BE HALTED, AND ALL MONETARY INTAKE, IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY PROFIT OR LOSS SUSTAINED BY THE OFFENDING ENTITY, WILL BE SEIZED &amp; RETURNED TO THOSE ENTITIES WHOSE WORK THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WAS TRAINED ON. THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MATTERS SUCH AS HIRING AND FIRING, DELEGATION OF TASKS AND FUNDING, APPLICATION OF MEDICAL CARE, AND THE CREATION OF COMPANY OR GOVERNMENTAL POLICY OR PROCEDURES IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED BY LAW AND WILL LEAD TO DISSOLUTION OF THOSE ENTITIES FOUND TO HAVE USED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR THESE PURPOSES.&quot; Protect the PEOPLE, not the corporations, and not those using their monetary excess to lobby for governmental protections which would actually disseminate harm to the common citizen. Nobody should be legally allowed to make money by training a machine to copy the work of others, and yet this practice is spreading like wildfire, growing exponentially in ways that the legal system was simply not fast enough to get ahead of. Still, it can be stopped. And writing into law that such &quot;artificially intelligent&quot; machine learning cannot be used to replicate the work of humans to earn profit without PROPER COMPENSATION for the humans who created the work being used to &quot;teach&quot; the machines. The current state of &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is not intelligent on its own. It can only reflect back what it has been taught. It cannot think or draw new conclusions. It can only copy, reproduce, copy, reproduce, never coming up with its own ideas. It has beneficial applications, sure, but in the context of copyright, moneymaking, and ETHICAL distribution of TRUTH &amp; knowledge, no AI programs should ever be allowed to take the lead. People should lead, and people should be fairly compensated for their work, not stolen from &amp; replicated by machines which then sell their work, DIRECTLY STEALING MONEY from the pockets of the original artists &amp; creators. We need to set better standards &amp; procedures to protect people from having their work stolen, and being lied to by machines who produce and spread half-truths and misinformation/Disinformation. Public health &amp; safety is at great risk here. The Pandora&#39;s box has been opened already, but we can stop the calamity from growing. The use of &quot;AI&quot; should not obfuscate the obvious theft going on here, and those using AI to make money should be held to a standard of ethics maintaining truth &amp; fair use of the content &amp; information the AI is trained on. Pay the people, not the program.
