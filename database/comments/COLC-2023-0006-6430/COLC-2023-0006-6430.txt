Hello, I work in the entertainment industry as an animator and digital artist. I don&rsquo;t believe that AI generated works, such as but not limited to, AI generated writing, AI generated art, or AI generated acting and voice acting should be able to be copyrighted by corporations. AI cannot work without the input of human works and if the original creator of the work did not give the AI permission to use their work then by definition the AI is stealing and should not be allowed copyright. Even if a company owns the writing, art, or acting the AI is using the original creator of the work should still have a right to say wether they want their work used in AI.
