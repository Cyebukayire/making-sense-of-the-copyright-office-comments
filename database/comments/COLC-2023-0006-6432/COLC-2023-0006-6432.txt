<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI users should not receive the benefit of copyright for their products.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI art is created using the work of actual human creatives.   Often it is refined by using an actual human-artist name as a modifying condition. In either or both cases, it is plagiarism and constitutes theft of the original human artist&rsquo;s legal license to exploit their own work.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Most human artists exploited did and do not want to have their work &ldquo;scraped.&rdquo;<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Bestowing copyright on this process would give the benefit of respectability to plagiarists.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Multiple studies show that AI cannot be created sourced from its own art-product; it requires the work of actual human artists to generate usable images.  Thus, AI is a parasite.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI art is being marketed by its entrepreneurs as a way for corporations to get creative work at low or no cost; this would steal jobs from human artists, actors and writers, destabilizing their already precarious financial environment.  The promise of AI replacement is already affecting job availability in many different creative fields, as shown by the Hollywood writers&rsquo; strike.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Extending copyright to AI product would make it legally easier for corporations to replace independently contracted creatives.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Finally, it is unhealthy for a society to outsource its folklore - its stories and images and fables - to machines.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>All art is information; it messages the ideals of the people who created it, and the society in which they live.  The purpose of art is its message - art is about humans telling humans how to be human.  However, AI is not human, or even self-aware; it creates art-like product with no intrinsic message.  The viewer is the source of all the meaning they find in the image. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Humans projecting into an AI image are reinforced in their preexisting beliefs which can be bad for themselves and for society as a whole. Humans need more help being human right now, not less.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>For these reasons, I ask you to withhold the benefits of copyright from those with AI works.
