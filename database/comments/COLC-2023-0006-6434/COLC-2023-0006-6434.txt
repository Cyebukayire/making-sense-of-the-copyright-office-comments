It is my personal belief that AI generated works, whether done to create art or write pieces of literature, are none copyrightable pieces inherently due to the nature of how it works. To upload hundred of thousands of preexisting art pieces, novels, etc into an ai and generate a form of text or artwork is not transformative as much as it is Frankensteining together the work of artists and profiting off of the work that other people have already done. As an artist myself it is incredibly disheartening to see so many artists be exploited by people who run these generators and claim to be putting as much effort into generating these pieces as the original artist did making their pieces in the first place. I find that AI, if used at all, can be used as a tool but never as a complete replacement for artisans as a whole, AI generated works cannot exist on its own due to its main function of relying on the efforts of countless artists and writers to generate anything in the first place, hence making it not viable to copyright. The same thing applies to AI generated voices of famous singers or celebrities, people cannot profit off of the preexisting talents of these people as it uses an entire persons voice without permission. I hope you take my words into consideration for what you choose to do regarding regulating ai.
