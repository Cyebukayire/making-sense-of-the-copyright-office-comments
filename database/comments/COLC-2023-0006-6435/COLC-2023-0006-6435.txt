While there are some genuine uses for AI, it is currently being used to devalue and replace the labor of working Americans, many of whom have spent years honing a craft such as writing, drawing or painting, and more recently singing and acting. As long as Americans need jobs, we must resist automation for these skilled creative careers. There is no easing of burdens here which automation promised, it is instead robbing people of the opportunity to make a living as a creative. The US government MUST implement laws which restrict the use of AI technology in creative projects. It must also restrict the ability for companies, particularly social media companies, to train AI on user data and content. Even resumes are subject to this kind of AI training. At the very least people should not be fooled into providing free training to the very technologies which will put them out of a job.
