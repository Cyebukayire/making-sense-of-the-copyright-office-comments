As someone who has been working toward being a published novelist since I was 12 and as someone who has been pressured into using AI services like ChatGPT in my employment, AI deeply worries me. In 2022, I was hired by a company to write creative and technical material for their blog, website, etc. There were technical elements, but they primarily hired me for creativity&mdash;there are a lot of companies writing about what I was writing about and they wanted to stand out. <br/><br/>In early 2023, my employer started pushing me to use AI for first drafting, which I have commonly seen as a cited use that &quot;should&quot; be copyrightable. To that, I say: absolutely not. The first draft is the heart of whatever you&#39;re writing, whether it be a blog post or a sixteen-volume book series. The first draft is messy because it records the human mind in progress, thinking through the problem or scenario and coming out with a work unique to an individual. It is the basis for intellectual property, because it records a person&#39;s intellect.<br/><br/>Prior to 2023, I really enjoyed my job. I liked the people I worked with and I thought they respected me. When ChatGPT took off, I learned that they thought my human creativity was replaceable by a machine. I remember multiple meetings where someone asked how I would reword something or say something and I would pause to think&mdash;to use my human brain to do my job&mdash;and in the time I took to think about the target audience of a piece of writing, how to best explain a complicated technical concept, or how to make someone care about a subject they haven&#39;t encountered, my coworkers would plug the problem into ChatGPT and come up with the most generic, milquetoast, bare minimum sentence I&#39;ve ever heard. And then they&#39;d crow because a machine was &quot;writing.&quot;<br/><br/>And, on a more technical note, AI is not capable of being creative. Even when queried to produce writing in different styles, it says the same thing. And when it IS queried to produce writing in different styles, the prompt is most often &quot;write this like Stephen King,&quot; or &quot;write this like Bren&eacute; Brown.&quot; A human writer writing in the style of another writer writes from their memory, which is tinted with their own perspective, experience, and talent. AI pulls language directly from the source with no filter. If I&#39;d done that, I&#39;d be sued for theft.<br/>And our copyright system should not allow for a tool whose basic function is carefully calculated plagiarism.<br/><br/>I left that job in May; took a 30k pay cut to keep writing what I wanted to write. I only ever used AI for outlining, very briefly, and it still made me a worse writer. It took work that had previously been fulfilling and enjoyable and made it feel like cheap fraud. It made my work sound like everyone else&#39;s&mdash;it took away the parts of it that were mine. The only scenarios that I would consider AI to be helpful is as a grammar checker and a copy editing tool. The human eye isn&#39;t great at catching small mistakes or repetitive language after a long time working on the same piece of writing. Otherwise? Leave it to the professionals.
