I believe that AI generated images, as well as AI generated stories and songs, should never be copyrighted, and that the use of copyrighted material in the training of AI should not be done.<br/>The rest of my comment is form from responses to several of the questions raised by the Copyright Office on this:<br/>1. Generative AI has a high risk of damaging creatives and their workplace, thanks to allowing corporations to reduce their number of working artists, and to reduce their pay.<br/>3. One paper important for this topic is the paper AI art and its Impact on Artists(https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3600211.3604681).<br/>6. Copyright protected training materials used to train generative AI are varied and numerous. For image generators, the training data set contains a high number of copyrighted paintings and drawings, as well as photos, while for large language models, the training data set contains copyrighted books and articles taken without permission.<br/>6.1. The developers of the AI models mostly got the material by scrapping the internet, with third parties playing an important role in collecting the data.<br/>6.2. Currently, copyrighted works represent a significant part of the training data set for generative AI programs, with the copyrighted works being necessary for the level of quality produced by the better programs. To my knowledge, there is no liscencing models used by any of the companies responsible for the more popular models.<br/>6.3. Non-copyrighted works do represent an large part of the training data set for the programs, but their importance is secondary compared to that of the copyrighted works.<br/>7. While I do not have exactly the space to properly describe the programs in higher details, from what I know the works used to &rdquo;train&rdquo; the AIs for lack of a better terms are collected in data sets, that are then scanned, to allow the programs to find patterns, and to save characgeristics from the images under the form of weights in the algorithm, allowing the AI programs to generate what can best be described as a collage of the original works. While this term is not exactly 100% technically correct, it is a pretty good understand of what the programs actually generate, with the result being closer to a collage then a fully original work.<br/>9. Copyright owners should have to affirmatively consent, aka to opt for their works to be used by the algorithm.<br/>18. Most case of use of generative AI should not make someone an &rdquo;author&rdquo; of the resulting material, thanks to the lack of control and intentionality over the final product.<br/>25. If the AI-generated material is found to infringe on copyright, then the ones who should be directly liable ought to be the developers of the generative AI model. Users should only be secondary liable under specific conditions.<br/>25.1. In the case of &rdquo;open-source&rdquo; AI models, the main consideration is in them making it harder to propery enforce laws. In this case, some users could be considered directly liable, depending on the case.<br/>28. Yes, the law should require AI-generated material to be labeled as such.<br/>29. Currently there do exist programs that can identify AI generated images with some degree of success, but they do have a risk of false positives. Currently, the ability to detect Ai generated text is not possible by algorithms. Such risks mean it would be better to deal with such issues at the training stage, or at the data gathering stage, and not at the output.<br/>32. In the case of programs that copy the style, the copyright protections should only concentrate on the use of the images in the training data set, and on banning the training of the algorithms on copyrighted images, without permission from the owners.
