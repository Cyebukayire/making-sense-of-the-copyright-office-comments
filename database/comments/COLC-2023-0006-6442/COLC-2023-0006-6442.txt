If AI is trained by human material without the consent of artists, writers and other professionals, it is unethical to place copyright claim on produced results. Also, if content itself is not created by the hand or mind of a human, not one person could hold ownership. Many jobs are at stake due to this technology, but above all else, society is not prepared to deal with the implications that come with artificial intelligence. It is an infringement on privacy, and is susceptible to false information, harmful bias, and threatening national security. We must hit the brakes on Generative AI and Chat GPT for the sake of humanity.
