Thank you for opening this comment period. Please protect individual artists with the rules you create. It will destroy American productivity and artistry of artists know that individuals can feed their work to machines to create low quality replicas with little effort. In the same way that xeroxing a piece of art does not create new art, AI machines must not be allowed to consume public work for generative commercial uses without compensation or crediting the author. (Parody, of course, is excluded.) we must not facilitate theft. Thank you for your consideration.
