It is important to remember AI stands for ARTIFICIAL Intelligance. It can never be human. A human going back to edit, fix or change whatever it generated afterwards does not change that. <br/><br/>AI is not a tool. It is not like a typewriter, a keyboard, a drawing tablet or any other tool used to create.  <br/>It is a means to and an end. The end being replacing artists,writers and all creative people&#39;s jobs. The AI community and those wishing for it&#39;s copyright have no respect for the arts. It is imperative to listen to the concerns of those opposing this. <br/><br/>If AI becomes copyrightable what is stopping Studios or other companies from laying off their artists,writers and actors in favor of AI? <br/><br/>Furthermore, what kind of world would we allow ourselves to live in where something can be generated artificially could get a copyright? What does that say about hard work of humans? Is their work lesser because it takes time and more money? That  you must deal with a person with complex feelings,emotions and needs over something that does whatever you ask of it without question? That if something goes wrong in whether it is a minor hiccup to something detrimental that caused harm to REAL people then who is liable? You can&#39;t hold an AI accountable the same way you can a human.  <br/>What&#39;s the worst case scenario of allowing something AI generated to have copyrights? How is that handled?<br/><br/>If AI becomes copyrightable it continues to perpetuate the idea the arts and the PEOPLE in those fields are &quot;lesser&quot;. The idea of &quot;Well, why would I teach myself to draw when this AI can do it for me?&quot; &quot;Why teach students creative writing when there is AI generators that will do it for them?&quot; &quot;Why hire these writers, these actors, these artists?&quot; It&#39;s a dangerous slope and the outcome does much more harm than good. It&#39;s giving up on even bothering to teach and encourage people to pursue creative fields! <br/><br/>It completely disregards the incredible hard work creatives have put into honing their craft during their lifetime. To establish themselves and get a job doing what they love.<br/> AI truly is the lazy,cheap,soulless and mindless way out. <br/>What does that say if AI is copyrightable? Do not worry about honing a craft. There is no point. Your hard work as a artists,writer ect. is worth less than an ARTIFICIAL generator. Let the AI do it all for you and be glad you even still have a job?<br/><br/>I leave with this. Do we really want to start that fire? Think of the people, your fellow humans. Do we really want to put ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGANCE in the same league or even about humans?
