&quot;Artificial intelligence&quot;-- or more technically, &quot;machine-learning scripts&quot;-- cannot be allowed to be monetized by corporations (who are also not people; corporations are nothing more than a legal fiction created for the purposes of allowing company owners to avoid liability) while also allowing them to essentially plagiarize the hard work of real human beings.<br/><br/>If they are allowed to copyright, then I propose the following rules:<br/>1:  All source images used to generate Machine-Learning-Script-created art must be credited in the art&#39;s data file.<br/>2:  If sources cannot be found or will not be divulged, the art cannot be copyrighted.<br/>3:  Sourced images MUST have given explicit permission to be used for Machine-Learning Script-created art. If even a single sourced author does not give permission, the art cannot be copyrighted.<br/>4:  Machine-Learning Script-created art must be held as a lower form of copyright over art produced by real, actual human beings.<br/>5:  Corporations that use Machine-Learning Script to generate art must be heavily penalized (including the loss of copyrightability) for attempting to go after real, actual human beings that are creating art in traditional ways.<br/><br/>Remember, Copyrights are designed to protect real, thinking human beings, and the law should represent that.  Machine-Learning Scripts are not thinking entities, nor are corporations.
