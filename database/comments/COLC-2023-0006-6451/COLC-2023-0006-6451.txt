I am profoundly disabled. I cannot walk, I cannot work. I cannot even stand very well. I have degenerative diseases. I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ll live but I&#39;m no longer terminal. my only way to support myself financially is through art. my hands shake too much to paint, or use markers, or use anything besides oil pastels, crayons or tube crayons... so I draw on my iPhone and iPad. I rely on this to make money. it&#39;s the only kind of labor I can do, besides imagining stories. these two things, they&#39;re the only things I have left. my eyes aren&#39;t even that good. ai is threatening the only way I have to make money. every day I am threatened by &quot;scalpers&quot; so per se who wish to steal my art and feed it to an ai so it will shit out five thousand identical images, to feed my writing and create a hundred bastardized paragraphs and then i will have no work, no money, no money for doctors appointments to get medications, tests to confirm i dont have cancer, interventional surgery and treatment for the disease that will turn me into steven hawking if i dont get pills or injections fast enough. a worst scenario of generative image and writing ai has me broke, destitute and sicker than i already am. regulate this. please, regulate this. I can&#39;t even post my art without fear of some techno-bro stealing it and sneering at me, telling me &quot;you are a dog and this computer does it better than you!&quot;
