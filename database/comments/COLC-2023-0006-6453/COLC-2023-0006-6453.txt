Services such as ChatGPT and Midjourney should not be protected under copyright, because they are not truly generating anything unique, they are merely remixing already existing images that are copyrighted. It is more comparable to a parody, which is not protected under copyright because it is based off another property, rather than being a unique creation. If anything, regulations should adapt to defend copyrighted materials such as movies, television shows, webseries, and video games from being used without permission to train these generative AIs. Without these protections, and with the strides the generation programming has done already, &quot;A.I artists&quot; could easily produce fake goods and sell pirated content.
