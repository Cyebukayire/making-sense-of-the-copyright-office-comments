Thanks for providing this opportunity. As it stands now, AI-generated content is theft. It relies on training sets often cultivated without the permission of the original copyright owner. The way the data comes together it&#39;s impossible to say which text influenced which decision, so you can&#39;t even claim some kind of group copyright for all &quot;contributing&quot; authors (who are, again, often &quot;contributing&quot; without the option to opt-out). No copyright should be assigned to any AI-generated work at this stage, potentially at any stage.
