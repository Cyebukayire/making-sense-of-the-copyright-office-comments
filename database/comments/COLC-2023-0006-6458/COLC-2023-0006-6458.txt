As it stands, I am strongly against fully-AI-generated works or works containing fully-AI-generated materials being valid for copyright. Most AI used for this purpose draw from databases containing thousands of works that the creators &amp; owners of the AI were not given permission to use in this manner, resulting in art of all kinds from thousands of artists being used for profit without any acknowledgement from or gain for the original artist, and without permission of any sort from said artist. Careers are already being affected- freelance artists are losing customers to AI trained on their very own works, works that they were never asked for permission to use in this manner.
