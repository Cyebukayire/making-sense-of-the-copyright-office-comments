I believe AI should not be trained with copyrighted materials (visual, audio, or written) without express permission of the copyright owners. Also AI generated materials should not be able to be sold, copyrighted, or trademarked. AI is an interesting and powerful tool, but should remain open access and any and all generated content should be licensed under creative Commons, since it wasnt created by an actual person and is not original work. I also believe AI generated images should not be coming up as results on image searches unless &#39;AI generated&#39; is expressly searched for. it only leads to art theft and misinformation.
