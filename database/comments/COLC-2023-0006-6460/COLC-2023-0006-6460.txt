I think the majority of AI tools right now are made with exploitative data sets and are unethical in their current state. I don&#39;t think that any AI generated art, written works, or other media should be copyrightable. Unless maybe in the future if the entire data set is made by the copyright holder, I&#39;m pretty sure right now none of the tools are good enough to function on small sample data sets but perhaps in the future there&#39;s a way where these tools could be used ethically and I&#39;d be okay with supporting copyrightable works coming from them.
