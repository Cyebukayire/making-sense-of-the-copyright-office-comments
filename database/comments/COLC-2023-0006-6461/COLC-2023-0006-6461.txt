AI usage could quickly become something that is dangerous to a lot of people&#39;s jobs. I would suggest less than 10% of a work be completed by AI in order for it to be copyrighted. This would allow artists, translators, and writers to use such things for references without it taking from the integrity of their work. AI should be used as a tool, and not a way to cut human interaction out of a creative work. The industrial revolution cut humans out of most manual labor and we saw benefits and drawbacks from that. Cutting humans out of the creative works most of us find joy in could be catastrophic for the mental health of society as a whole. If your job could be done &quot;good enough&quot; by a machine to the untrained eye you would be fighting for your livelihood as well.
