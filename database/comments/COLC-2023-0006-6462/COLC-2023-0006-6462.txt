This technology only functions by theft. Stealing work from people simply because they deem a skill they do not have as worthless until they need it, is abhorrent. AI can only create after having human made images/ writing dumped into their prompts. They cannot create anything new, and cannot even create without said stolen work. This reeks of someone wanting a service, but not wanting to pay for said service. <br/><br/>
