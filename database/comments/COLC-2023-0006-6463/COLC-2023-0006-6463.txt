It&#39;s time for the federal government to wake up and take a stance.  Our economy is teetering on the brink of collapse (or in my opinion, it&#39;s already started sliding down towards the edge) and we keep getting bogus consumer inflation numbers based on statistics not made public and false promises of alleviating the burden on the working class - but never do we see action taken.  Allowing the continuation of mass theft in the form of datasets for machine learning and generative models will only serve to accelerate this crash.<br/><br/>The billionaire class has been ballooning their wealth by trillions since the pandemic nearly brought everything tumbling down - in large part aided by the government - while laborers continue to struggle more and more.  Recently we&#39;ve seen a trend of working class Americans withdrawing their 401k savings in order to keep up with the cost of living, which is concerning for multiple reasons.  One is that none of us young enough to see the cataclysm of the climate crisis expect to make it to retirement anyway, another is that even if we make it we will starve if we don&#39;t pay our bills now and another is that the stock market is held up by working class Americans buying into it through their jobs for retirement.  This could mean a crash like what we saw in 2008 is coming, or even something as catastrophic as the Great Depression.  Not only is the government not taking action to help out the majority of this country&#39;s citizens in the face of this disaster - its complacence makes it complicit in the largest instance of mass theft ever seen that we call &quot;AI&quot;.<br/><br/>The reason I address the impending economic collapse is because it would be devastating enough for creatives if that was all that was going on.  But it isn&#39;t, is it?  We have to worry about that while suffering through our livelihoods being stripped away from us by the wealthiest individuals on the planet - all while being told it&#39;s about time we got taken down a peg.  Silence on the part of the federal government is seen as encouragement for this greed to continue and grow - damning those of us who are affected most by it. <br/><br/>Finally, this brings me to the gaming industry.  It is an incredibly large industry, and makes up an enormous part of our economy.  Many, many of the workers in that industry are artists, who are being exploited and taken advantage of in a way that could seriously cripple their careers.  Do you see where this is going?  In an already failing economy on the edge of disaster, the government continues to allow the leeching of one of the largest groups of workers in one of the largest sectors of the economy - almost certainly assuring that collapse is coming and it will be even more destructive than foreseen.  <br/><br/>We need help.  We need someone to step in and put protections in place - not just for the sake of artists - but for the sake of every working class American.
