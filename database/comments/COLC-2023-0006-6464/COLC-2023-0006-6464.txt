I think everyday people should be able to completely block large companies&#39; ability to steal their talents and labor to be minced up in a machine learning algorithm. I also think that this avenue should be easy to access, so that it&#39;s more difficult for companies. Companies have resources, everyday people don&#39;t. Maybe have it so that people&#39;s work cannot be used by an AI unless they explicitly state that it can be in a legally binding way. In this manner, average people wouldn&#39;t have to go out of their way to copyright everything they do. <br/><br/>I also think that producers of AI should be able to dictate what their AI can be used for if they are selling it off to another company. For example, they should be able to ban a company purchasing their product to use that product to create news articles, or social media posts, or whatever else they deem necessary. This way, programmers of AI have the power to ensure that their work isn&#39;t abused. <br/><br/>Finally, there should be laws that make AI easy to spot. AI written articles will have to clearly state that they were written by an AI, and should state exactly which program is being used. Laws around AI should force it to be a transparent process, so that it is easy to tell what is made with AI, what kind of AI is being used to make a product, and who the people around the AI (who made it and who is using it). <br/><br/>These are very harsh guidelines for companies, but that&#39;s how it should be. As it stands, companies are immensely powerful, and I worry about what AI could be used for if it is hard to tell the difference between AI and people. It would allow companies to gain a level of vertical integration unlike ever before if harsh policies are not strictly enforced around the use of AI. Additionally, most people (me included), don&#39;t know all the intricacies of AI. We don&#39;t know what we&#39;re dealing with as it stands. This has caused economic catastrophe in the past (such as in 2008, when a housing bubble wasn&#39;t easily visible to most of the public), and thus it is crucial that AI be heavily limited and forced into transparency in order to prevent such a thing in the future. If greedy companies can&#39;t be stopped now, it will be much harder to stop them down the line if things go horribly wrong. <br/>
