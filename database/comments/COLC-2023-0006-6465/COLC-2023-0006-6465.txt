I have spent the last 15 years working 12 hours days in an effort to improve my skills as a 3D Artist, and improve my hireability as well as further my goals to eventually become self-employed by creating my own projects in my own art style. <br/>The fact that these A.I companies have illegally harvested essentially all art from the internet without any consent from the artists who have, like me, spent countless thousands of hours to come up with a unique style that makes them valuable to film and game studios, is terrible, and corrupt and heart-breaking. <br/>There are ethical A.I image generators that exist, and if you compare the quality of those, and the ones like Open A.I, and Midjourney that rely on stolen art, the difference is night and and day. These companies are creating billions of dollars of value off the back of millions of hard working artists from around the world that receive 0 compensation, recognition, or ability to protect themselves from this theft. Please help protect artists like myself who have spent their entire life striving to achieve a skill level in something that is incredibly time demanding, often requiring working long extra hours after their 8 hour shift to become skilled in whichever artistic craft they chose to pursue, only to have the result of those long hours ripped away from them without their consent.  <br/><br/>I&#39;ve had the pleasure of working for Disney, Zack Snyder, and on multiple large projects in my career, but at the moment I don&#39;t know if my job will exist in the near future, because my art, and the art of my colleagues has been stolen from us, and is now being used to take our jobs away from us. <br/>In China something like 60% of concept artists have lost their jobs to A.I, and a large percentage of the remaining artists are simply being used to further train A.I until they too are seen as something to discard. I would love to see The United States show that what these companies are doing is wrong, that the illegal data they have harvested from around the world needs to be wiped clean from their systems, and if they&#39;re going to make an A.I it needs to be built ethically and consentually.
