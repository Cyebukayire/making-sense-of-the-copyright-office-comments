AI shouldn&rsquo;t be mandated for copyright through compliance or obligations on the organization generating the AI copyrighted material. The burden of proof should be on the application or service that is interpreting human vs ai generated content on whether that copyright is enforceable, It would be near impossible for every organization to not only understand all of the content being created, but more importantly by exactly who. That is even difficult to prove with humans today. So adding AI assistance shouldn&rsquo;t disqualify AI content from being copyrighted. With the amount of potential copyrighted material, it also wouldn&rsquo;t be wise to enforce the current regulations, since copyright farms would write and create almost every word possible in a matter of time.<br/><br/>
