I believe AI systems should be heavily regulated. I believe it is plagiarism to allow these systems to use human created works as their basis for learning and &quot;creation&quot;. If a company chooses to use an AI system that will learn from data and works that are owned solely by that company, then I think it is fine. However, I believe it is unethical for an AI system to &quot;learn&quot; and &quot;create&quot; from just any available set of data and works on the internet or elsewheere.
