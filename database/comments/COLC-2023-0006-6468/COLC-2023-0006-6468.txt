Hello,<br/>Copyright is one of the basic rights of any individual as it allows them to benefit from their creations. Allowing billion dollar companies to mass scrape countless copyrighted material without any consent and compensation to the copyright holder, and then use it to train their Generative AI which is then used to compete in the same market as the original copyrights holders&#39; market is ridiculous and this practice should be seen as violation of Copyrights. It massively affects and directly targets creative fields and individuals and their livelihoods. Big tech companies that participate in this practice should be held responsible for their violation of copyright holders&#39; rights.<br/><br/>There is an ethical way to implement these techs which unfortunately is not seen as a viable option by these tech companies as they have to seek consent from individual creators and compensate them which in turn is really expensive, which then begs the question &quot; If the tech companies can&#39;t do this the right way, then why should they even do it in the first place?&quot;. And I really really really ask the USCO to stand with the creatives and not to throw them under the bus for the sake of greedy big tech companies. <br/><br/>Again, consent, credit and Compensation (just like our Great Karla Ortiz put it) are the key. Forced compensation without consent should also be seen as violations of rights. And also many of these companies offer opt out now after violating the copyright holders&#39; rights for so long. Its ridiculous. After all their violations, they want the individuals to actively look whether their work&#39;s been used in the training data and opt-out? ridiculous!! It should be their responsibility to collect their data responsibly. Excuses such as &quot;It is too much data, so asking consent is impossible&quot; or &quot;It requires too much data, so Opt-in wont give us enough data&quot; should be criticized. What they mean by that first excuse is that they are too lazy to ask for consent , which shows &#39;their&#39; lack of ability and that is their own problem to solve and not for the individuals to solve. Then the second excuse is really dubious. No one can just directly enroll someone for organ donation without concerned party&#39;s(when they are alive) or their family&#39;s consent(if they have passed away). Why should this be any different? Opt-in should be the only norm and not Opt-out.<br/><br/>And regarding giving Copyright protection to AI works, simply put, it should not be done as only humans can be a owner of copyrighted work as only humans can give conscious inputs to create a work so that it can satisfy the needs for the protection of Copyright. <br/><br/>And regarding giving Copyright protection to AI assisted works, I agree with the USCO&#39;s current stance on it, that Copyright protection should be given to the parts of the work that the human author inputted and not for the AI created part. But one additional suggestion that I want to give is that, the USCO should also look into the AI tool that&#39;s been used and the legitimacy of the AI tools&#39; creation, ensuring that no Copyrights holder&#39;s right&#39;s been violated (meaning that the USCO should verify that data used for the training of the AI tool in question is obtained &#39;with&#39; consent and provides compensation to the copyrights holder). If it is found that the AI has been built on violation of Copyrights, then the copyright should not be granted even for the human inputted part and ask them to modify it so that no copyrights had been violated in the process of creating that work to be granted the protection.<br/><br/>Thank You for asking for the comments. Hope USCO does the right thing it has to do to protect the rights of the Copyright holders.
