Why are we even asking computers to make art? What else is the point of humanity? Automation should be used to keep humanity safer with a basis of science behind it. We don&#39;t need to reinvent phrenology in order to &quot;predict likely criminals,&quot; we need to automate taxes. We need AI to plan gross ecological rebuilding projects and design machines that will prevent repetitive injuries in laboratories. Most importantly we must remember that these are machines with no concept of ethics that are predicting what they should say next based on what has been input by its creators. AI is a fancy calculator, not an author, artist, politician, policeman, or even a reliable source of facts. It&#39;s a Speak and Spell. Keep it on that track.
