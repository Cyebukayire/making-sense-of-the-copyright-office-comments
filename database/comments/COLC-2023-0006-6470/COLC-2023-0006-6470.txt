As a writer and artist I am worried about the use of AI, specifically as fewer and fewer asset holders use AI to avoid copyright law, to avoid paying creators fairly, and otherwise. I believe it should be the Copyright Office&#39;s responsibility to clearly state and enforce that art is created by people, and that therefore, art belongs to the people who create it, not to individuals who are able to purchase digital assets, generate them without paying artists, and evade litigation.
