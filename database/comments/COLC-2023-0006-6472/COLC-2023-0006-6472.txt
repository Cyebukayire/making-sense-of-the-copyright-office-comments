I believe it is a violation of copyright for AI devices to search previously published works of literature or art to create &quot;original&quot; content. The use of AI is harmful for both creators and consumers, in the realm of copyright, originality, and quality, and threatens the rights and wellbeing of creators. Guard us against AI creations.
