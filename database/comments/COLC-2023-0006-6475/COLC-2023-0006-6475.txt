I believe a potential risk of this technology is that it will unfairly devalue what creators and artists make, removing their due credit and profiting from their work. A &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; might be that people won&rsquo;t have to think about art anymore and can live in this dehumanized state of on-demand stolen work, but I can&rsquo;t really see that as a benefit when I know it hurts creators. If humans find healing in acts like expression and art therapy, then I believe the reverse is also true: humans will find harm when that creation is taken away or stolen from them to be fed into AI. I do believe it could potentially create a mental health crisis to allow technology like this to continue as is.
