As an artist and a creator I have not given any consent or authorization for my works to be used to train AI; neither have I received compensation nor credit. The unauthorized use of copyrighted material and properties in datasets to train models for profit is a complete and utter disregard to the rights of creators, innovators, artists, and all intellectual property.
