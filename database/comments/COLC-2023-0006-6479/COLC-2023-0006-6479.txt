AI generated material should never be copyrightable, and most definitely should not be allowed to be copyrighted without a human involved. AI is also a misnomer, since it is not artificial intelligence, but advanced algorithms using the data fed into it to generate material. AI models should both attribute the original source materials, and compensate copyright holders for using their material. They should not be allowed to use copyrighted material without permission of the copyright holder. Copyright liability with AI is a potential mess because of the lack of transparency on what copyrighted material is being fed into the AI. I think AI generated material, even with a human involved, should not be copyrightable, and any involvement of AI with a project should automatically make the project uncopyrightable. By it&#39;s definition, copyright is to protect art/work created by human writer or artist.
