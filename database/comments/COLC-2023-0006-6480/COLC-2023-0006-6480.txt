I do NOT believe that companies should be allowed to use the creations of human creators (artists, writers, etc) in order to train, refine or in any capacity for the company&#39;s  AI without the permission of the original creator.  I think this is an infringement of the rights of the original creator.  <br/>I do NOT believe that products created by AI should qualify for protection under copyright law, as they are not original creations.<br/>I do NOT believe that images of living people should be used in AI creations without the permission of the person depicted.  I don&#39;t even like it when people post pictures of me on Facebook, I think this is an invasion of my privacy !  <br/>I am not an artist  or writer, I just think that the use of AI to steal creativity from these people is wrong.
