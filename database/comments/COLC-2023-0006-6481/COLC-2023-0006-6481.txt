I am very against the developments of AI technology recently. Some of my favorite voice actors live in fear of their voices being stolen and used without their permission and have spoken out about how violated it can make them feel (Erika Harlacher-Stone&#39;s tweet on the subject was particularly eye-opening). In addition, several of my artist friends have noted two negative effects&mdash;firstly, a steep drop in their income via commissions and secondly, an increased derision from the general public, where some are questioning the artist&#39;s ability to create art, often suggesting that their own art is AI and should therefore be free. If AI was not harmful, I would not mind it and could even understand some of it&#39;s uses. Unfortunately, the popular implementation of AI has actively harmed art and writing communities in a massive and devastating scale and should not be allowed to continue to do so. AI practices a lack of consent and a complete disregard for bodily autonomy and is an incredible violation. We have to do better to protect people and the lives they have built.
