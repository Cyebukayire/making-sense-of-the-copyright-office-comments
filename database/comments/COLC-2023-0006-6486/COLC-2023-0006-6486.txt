I am a student from San Francisco, and so I am around both tech specialists and artists quite a bit. The process to train an AI to do the work of a human artist and then copyright that art, is to make money from theft. AI training nearly always incorporates artwork obtained without the consent of the artist, and so to copyright visual Art created by an AI is making money from the labor of others without their knowledge or consent.
