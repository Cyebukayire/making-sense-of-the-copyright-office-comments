I&#39;m a software engineer who has worked with companies the use machine learning and AI. For some use cases, I believe it will do a lot of good for humanity, but I am deeply concerned about some uses of AI in creative pursuits. Generative AI has shown signs of stealing artist&#39;s and writer&#39;s work, without attribution or permission--to the point where smudged signatures have showed up in AI art and writers have found their own writing replicated in ChatGPT (anecdotal, but a friend asked it to write something in her style and it just parroted back one of her own tumblr posts almost word for word).<br/><br/>This is a concerning undervaluation of the creatives that copywright law was meant to protect. <br/><br/>We can&#39;t, and shouldn&#39;t, stop the progress of technology, but we can, and should, be thoughtful about how it progresses and how we protect individual rights in the process.<br/>Thank you.
