I feel like an important consideration is that AI cannot produce wholly original creative works. It is trained and conditioned on works or art and literature taken from the internet, often without direct consent from the original authors and certainly without their profiting from it. In a very real sense, AI is plagiarism, and should not be copyrightable.
