I absolutely detest the idea of people profiting off of things that take the hard work of an individual hard working artist who creates things with love, vs a machine that creates things lifelessly in an instant that just steals from multiple hard working people. People who just make a quick buck off of stolen people&#39;s work , where the one who never gave the machine their permission to use their works aren&#39;t making a single buck. Artists deserve to be given money every time their work is used somewhere. Period. A machine who took many people&#39;s work should be paying every artist it took from. Otherwise, give artists the right to own their works. Stop allowing people to illegally take what isn&#39;t theirs and let artists do the things they love without the fear of having a machine take their job from them. <br/> It is scum. <br/>Give artists the tickets they deserve. Let them fight back for what was rightfully theirs.<br/>If people want AI, let it be limited with the permissions of the artists and stop letting it feed off of the millions of hardworking artists who want to do what they love and make money off of it. Please. Just let us live with what we love to make and what we love to do. Please stop these mindless machines from taking what we love to do... It&#39;s unfair. It&#39;s cruel. It&#39;s.. tiring. It brings out the worst in people. It brings violence and fear and anger. We don&#39;t want this. You don&#39;t want this. Give artists their rights to their own works.
