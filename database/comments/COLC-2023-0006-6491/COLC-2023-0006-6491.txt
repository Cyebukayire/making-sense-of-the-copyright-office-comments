Considering most creative AI (think ChatGPT and AI image generators) are only as good at the data set that they were trained on, and those data sets must be comprised of extant work, it seems somewhat ridiculous to be able to copyright the result. The underhanded tactics employed by these AI companies to curate data sets without the permission of the creators whose works are involved, and their extreme reluctance to compensate those creators in any way shape or form, only further solidifies my opposition to it, personally. It feels ridiculous to even suggest that you can make something by gluing hundreds of other people&#39;s work together, refuse to credit or pay those people, and then copyright it for monetization. It feels more ridiculous to suggest that this is how it SHOULD work.
