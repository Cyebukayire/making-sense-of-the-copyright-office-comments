Ai (as an Artist I will be mostly talking about Generative Ai) is built on theft. It does not learn the same humans do,it collects and scraps ALL the data online and &quot;creates&quot; an image. Please consider the danger of Ai (here&#39;s some examples):<br/>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65932372 (Illegal trade in AI child sex abuse images exposed)<br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/9/23788741/sarah-silverman-openai-meta-chatgpt-llama-copyright-infringement-chatbots-artificial-intelligence-ai<br/><br/>https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/deepfake-twitch-porn-atrioc-qtcinderella-maya-higa-pokimane-rcna69372<br/><br/>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artist-finds-private-medical-record-photos-in-popular-ai-training-data-set/<br/><br/>https://waxy.org/2022/09/ai-data-laundering-how-academic-and-nonprofit-researchers-shield-tech-companies-from-accountability/<br/><br/>The list can go on from Child pornography to medical records being used WITHOUT CONSENT! This AI should NEVER have a copyright,giving AI copyright is like giving a car thief car insurance for stealing.You are probably thinking &quot;well that can&#39;t happen&quot; but if you do give AI copyright protection you are giving people the right to steal. But not just stealing but also allowing exploiting of children,medical records,and much much more.<br/>We never think of the dangers,we think of &quot;progress&quot; but it&#39;s not progress! Taking away artists voice with this machine that did NOTHING but just STEAL! Harming more children in the future and dangers we can&#39;t even see that is ahead.
