AI models are almost universally a result of illegally utilized copyright material, and their creators are attempting to brush this off with the idea that since it already happened, they can just use it despite that.<br/><br/>This isn&rsquo;t how things work. If you steal something from the store and they don&rsquo;t notice until after you get home, you don&rsquo;t just get to keep the item. Similarly building a business off illegally obtained copyright material doesn&rsquo;t become legal just because you already parsed the data into your product and it&rsquo;s just too late.<br/><br/>AI further is used as a way to cheapen and remove the impact of artists and creators in all disciplines by replacing them with cheap, poorly made AI work that is again, based on illegally obtained material. This is purely an effort by the AI models to insert themselves as a low cost alternative and rely upon the relative complexity of AI in order to prevent people finding this out.<br/><br/>AI should be heavily regulated, and the models should be forced to pay their fair share to the artists whose work they illegally used in their creation. Anything less undermines intellectual property rights.
