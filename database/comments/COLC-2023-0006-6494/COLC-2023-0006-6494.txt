I do not think people should be able to copyright works created by artificial intelligence. These programs are only copying and remixing works created by human artists. I do not think circumventing human artistry should be rewarded. Many jobs held by human artists, such as writers, could be eliminated using A.I. writing. It would flood the market with cheap, uninspired writing. Images also are popular to make with A.I. programs. Using specific wording, people using A.I. could copy styles from artists without paying, use real people&#39;s faces and bodies without permission, and, again, flood the market. Being able to copyright these works would seriously devalue many of the real, human, artists who usually don&#39;t get paid much in the first place, but love their art and work hard to do it for a living. There&#39;s a good sentiment that I&#39;ve seen going around the internet. I don&#39;t remember the exact words, but it goes something like this: we grew up on all these science fiction stories where robots and computers advanced to the point of taking over work for us. I don&#39;t think anyone thought that they would get to be making all the art, painting pictures and telling stories, while we lowly humans still work in factories. I think we&#39;ve gone wrong somewhere. People love creating things. From buildings to paintings, stained glass windows to spreadsheets, everyone I know loves making something. It&#39;s expressive. It&#39;s freeing. People should be able to make things. People who have worked very hard and devoted their lives to their craft should be able to make a living. We don&#39;t want the world of art to be consumed by soulless A.I. pieces. They are forgeries, scraps of every piece of art they scanned without permission. They shouldn&#39;t be here. And for those insisting it&#39;s nothing more than a tool, slow me to remind you, if I submitted a paper written by A.I. to my college courses it would be considered academic dishonesty. Why? Because I did not write the paper. By the same token, A.I. works should not be granted copyright. Why? Because the people (or corporations) who want to own the copyright did not make that work. It&#39;s dishonest. It&#39;s cheap. It lacks integrity. Thank you for your time.
