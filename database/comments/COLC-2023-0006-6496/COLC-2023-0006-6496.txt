Material generated by the use of AI data sets should not be copywrited, and should be considered as theft. Legislation should be put in place to protect original works of art and allow the original creator to have legal avenues for receiving remuneration and/or removal for any works that infringe on their materials. <br/><br/>The use of AI to synthesize both Voice and Visual likeness of a person without their knowledge or consent should also be punishable by law. In situations where a Digital Likeness is created WITH consent of both parties there should be laws in place for the amount of time a Digital Likeness can be licensed for and ensuring a minimum wage for these terms. <br/><br/>Taking these steps and similar are vital and essential to protect the future of workers in an increasingly digital world. I call upon our Federal Government to take the use of AI seriously and to put into effect legislation that protects human creative products and their likeness.
