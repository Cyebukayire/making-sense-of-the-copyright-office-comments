As an artist and writer, I think AI should be banned from all sales of creativity, such as art (of all kinds: book covers, comics, graphic design, architecture, animation, 3D animation, commissions, etc.). Writing (of all kinds&mdash;books, all types of scripts, etc.) video games (especially for art, actors, etc.) Television, movies, music, etc. All types of media and creativity should not allow any AI, and if used in any circumstances, especially from sources like OpenAI or any sites like it that use unauthorized art or media that is stolen, The author, artist, etc. of stolen media should be allowed to sue for the money lost using their stolen media and should be allowed to send cease and desist letters if they can see their stolen media in any AI projects. Copyright should allow any creative or person to sue or take down any AI that sourced their media without permission, and AI should be banned from all types of media and not allowed to be copyrighted. As a creative person myself, I wish to protect myself and others from AI.
