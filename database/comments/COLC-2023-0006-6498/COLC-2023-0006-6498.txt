The rise of AI is frankly terrifying. I do not feel like I can even safely research things about my own health and well-being because I assume it has been meddled with and auto generated. The complete lack of oversight is concerning as the use of it is spreading like wildfire. I already have to contend with so much of my life online being scraped and turned into data points to sell me things and otherwise exploited. I do not like that true artists, writers, and creatives are basically being told their craft doesn&#39;t matter because it can just be strip mined and turned into trash because there isn&#39;t a need for human thought or compassion. Additionally we are in a climate crisis and AI as well as crytpo are incredibly draining of energy and natural resources. It is imperative we stop AI until well thought out guidelines have been established.
