AI using copyrighted materials without permission should be considered copyright infrigement and plagarism. Using someone else&#39;s work without permission for profit is already illegal if a human being does it why should a machine get special treatement?  <br/><br/>AI works should not be copyrightable because they&#39;re automatically infriging on someone else&#39;s copyright to make whatever it is they&#39;re making. <br/><br/>AI should not be allowed to copy people&#39;s voices or appreances for any purpose becaue it&#39;s privacy violation. There are already AIs that can generate nudes of people based on their clothed photos. This kind of thing should be considered sexual harassment. In general, AI using someones likeness/voice should be considered a violation of publicity rights/laws and unfair competition laws. <br/><br/>Whoever made and/or trained the AI and/or owns the AI should held legally responsible in all cases.
