The people who gravitate toward &quot;text to output&quot; AI,<br/><br/>These people come from a space that is not enlightened.<br/><br/>This is plainly clear, that the people using and promoting it, are of a certain kind, there is no question about that.<br/><br/>The question, is how to prohibit people, since prohibiting people in other areas like alcohol in America, was historically a troublesome social dilemma.<br/><br/>There is no question, that AI is being abused by the low people.<br/><br/>The real question is what to do about these people.<br/><br/>I propose that enlightened people should gather and address such things.<br/><br/>If unenlightened people are put in charge of any decision making, it will not result in an enlightened decision of what is to be done.<br/><br/>After the enlightened beings dictate to the low brow majority, then the low brow majority is to act in accord with it, without any wobbling.<br/><br/>The fact is, that only a minority of the humans on earth are intelligent as of today. We can not apply democratic ideals, when the majority are unenlightened and unintelligent.<br/><br/>
