As a professional artist, the prospect of being made obsolete frightens me. I&#39;ve worked hard for so many years to achieve the skills I have today. I&#39;ve paid a fortune to go to school for what I love and to improve my craft. I love my career, and I love to create. To me, Artificial Intelligence sends the message of &quot;we want your work, we don&#39;t want you.&quot; AI steals the hard work of artists and without credit, compensation, or permission, reworks it into something less original and impactful than what it took. Artists world wide are having their work stolen out from under them, and now larger studios are looking to join the mass theft by adapting AI for professional projects. There are jobs at risk here, mine included. Millions of people are having their livelihoods stolen out from under them. I am not obsolete. I am not a commodity. I am not replaceable
