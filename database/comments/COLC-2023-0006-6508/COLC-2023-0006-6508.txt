Hello! Thank you for opening this issue up for comments. I appreciate the chance to have a part in this ongoing development. As someone who deeply values art and artists as an essential extension of the human experience, both for entertainment and thought-development purposes, I&rsquo;d just like to say that artists and writers should give consent and receive compensation to be included in a training set. Additionally, images and writing resulting from AI should not be eligible for copyright without significant further human manipulation/improvement of the generated image. I&rsquo;m not saying that art should not be used to train AI, but I am saying that the artists have the right to consent and compensation.
