While generative Artificial Intelligence can be a useful tool for creators to hasten the speed at which they are producing content, the most popular forms of training AI are through theft using bots scraping the internet for copyrighted works produced solely by human labor without seeking or receiving permission.  The scraping of copyrighted material should be considered theft of labor.  Generative AI trained on copyrighted material produced by human labor which was not performed by the individual utilizing the generative AI should not be granted copyright protections.
