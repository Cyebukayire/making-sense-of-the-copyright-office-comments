I feel strongly that works created by generative machine learning models (AI) should not be protected under copyright. In the event of an individual or organization using an AI generated piece as the basis of their work, but further modifying it themselves, I believe that only the modifications that they made to the base piece should be protected, and not the base piece or the entirety of the modified piece.
