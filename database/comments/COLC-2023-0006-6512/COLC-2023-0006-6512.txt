I feel AI cannot reasonably be copyrighted or used in copyrighted material. We have laws against plaugerism, where the act of copying details from anothers work and passing it off as your own is unlawful. AI follows a similar scheme. If we allow AI to be used to sell art, music, television, any form of media or production then you would have to rewrite copyright laws as a whole to reflect giving people to use material they have not created nor have the rights to, and selling it as their own.
