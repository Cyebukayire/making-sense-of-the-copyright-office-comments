Any work created by an AI should not be able to be monetized or profited by. It is a regurgitation of others work that has been fed into the AI. It uses others work without permission. If someone uses AI to make something and then sells it, it is theft of all the artist and authors who&rsquo;s work has been put into it, and the money they earn should be given to those thousands of people instead. Profiting using work not your own is unethical and cannot be allowed.
