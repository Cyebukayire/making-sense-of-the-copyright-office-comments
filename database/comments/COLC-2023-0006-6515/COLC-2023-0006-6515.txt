&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; or &quot;AI&quot; should NOT have the privilege or right to be copyrighted as it cannot create or form original ideas, and all images or text made with them are pieced together from pre-existing works. To even call it &quot;intelligence&quot; is misleading as the machines we call &quot;AI&quot; cannot create anything uniquely new- only mix and match from existing data that it had to be fed. I fear the day an &quot;AI&quot; &quot;creates&quot; something obviously derivative of pre-existing work, have it copyrighted, then the original creator is subsequently harassed, bullied or fined for &quot;stealing&quot; the AI copyrighted material despite being, well, the original creator. Art made humans is more than just words or visuals. It has context, subtext, metacomentary, and intent, even if that intent is to say &quot;it doesn&#39;t mean anything at at&quot;. Written works require the intrinsic understanding of language and that words have meaning, which &quot;AI&quot;s cannot grasp. &quot;AI&quot;s cannot create art or writing that knowingly comments on more than just the art or writing itself. It just steals pre-existing works, cuts it up and glues it back together in a way that hopes to sound convincing without actually knowing what it means. <br/>We, as a nation, have already decided that non-human animals cannot hold copyrights, so why should a non-living, non-feeling, non-thinking machine have the right to copyrights? If the argument is that &quot;it is not the &#39;AI&#39; who holds the copyright, but the people who input the prompts&quot;, then how is that any different than a person commissioning an artist to paint a picture for them? A commissioner may put in suggestions and have specific poses, angles, and lighting in mind, but they are not the one putting paint to paper. The artist who painted the request is the default copyright holder because they are the one who physically created it.
