AI should not be used! Especially when creating art! Art is made by humans! By an idea! Only a human can create an idea, and only you can give that idea to an AI that will finish your worj for you. Stop being lazy and build some skills! Build your skills and you wouldn&#39;t have to use AI! Stop being so money hungry! You&#39;ll still have tons of money! You dont NEED all that money. We live in a capitalist world, humans NEED jobs to survive in this world, ESPECIALLY jobs they enjoy. A job we love keeoa us sane and going! AI is stealing people&#39;s work, words, face, and voice! If you use AI, PAY the people you used the art or voice from and so fourth! Thank you.
