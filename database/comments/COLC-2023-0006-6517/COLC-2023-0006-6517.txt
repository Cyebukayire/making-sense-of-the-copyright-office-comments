There must be restrictions on Large Language Models (LLM,) what they are allowed to synthesize, and who gets credit for the result. It will be too easy to steal other people&#39;s writing via LLMs, and claim rearranging a few words and sentences makes the work original. LLMs must be barred from violating copyright, and those who use LLMs should not be permitted to register another person&#39;s work as their own.
