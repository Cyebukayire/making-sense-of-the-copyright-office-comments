I cannot see how it is possible for anyone to copyright generative-AI when ALL generative-AI is stolen material, without consent or compensation, from its original creators. The original creator owns the copyright and therefore, AI has no legal right to use or copyright anything created with it. Laws need to be created and put into place that restrict AI to ONLY material that has been properly licensed for use and compensated accordingly. Automatic &quot;opt-in&quot; apps and programs should be banned. All users shouldn&#39;t have to stress to find an &quot;opt-out&quot; link, but instead should have the option to opt-in if they so choose, and only with material that they own the copyright to. Further, nothing AI creates is original or new. It is simply a compilation of stolen material dressed up and pretending to be original. When it comes to the creative arts, be it music or dance or writing or poetry or art and painting and so on, AI has no place. Creative arts are HUMAN arts. Where AI would be most beneficial in this world is to make life easier for those struggling under the pressures of physical &quot;grunt&quot; work. That is where it would be of benefit. It has zero benefit in a creative environment, when again, its &quot;creativity&quot; to use the term extremely loosely, is based on stolen copyrighted work. AI is machine generated code, which has no place whatsoever in the field of creative arts. So...in my opinion, not only should AI be banned, especially from the creative arts fields, it should also never be permitted or accepted for copyright.
