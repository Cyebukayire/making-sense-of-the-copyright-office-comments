I&rsquo;m a mom of a 15 year old boy, and I  work full time as a physician assistant. My 71 year old uncle with cancer has to live with me.  What I will say is that CLEARLY I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to investigate the intricacies of AI, so I really rely on ????? hopefully people who remember that there are quite a lot of &ldquo;just normal&rdquo; people scraping by &mdash; if our socioeconomic issues are not addressed &mdash; if wealth disparity is not addressed &mdash; can we please have a large number of experts weigh in on what would be best for humanity? <br/>I know we only care about the American outcome (or investors/lobbyists&rsquo; desired outcome), but it would be truly fantastic if, for once, we could think something through with 7 generations mentality? <br/>I don&rsquo;t think most people desire more than they have &mdash; they want to pay the bills, work, have some family vacation time and they enjoy when they aren&rsquo;t at max-overdrive stress level, which is where I spend most of my life! <br/>How about &ldquo;what would the leaders of Iceland or Finland do?&rdquo; in this AI situation &mdash; also in light of everything else that is simultaneously transpiring around the world now. Do we truly have no control over anything? Is there truly never a consensus for humanity? You would think there would be. So what&rsquo;s the hang up on just making GOOD DECISIONS?  <br/><br/>It&rsquo;s Labor Day weekend &mdash; if AI decimates a huge number of people&rsquo;s work and bill-paying abilities, what is going to happen?  We just continue blaming all of those at the bottom?  We have money to invest in billions of weapons dollars for Ukraine, but we &ldquo;just don&rsquo;t have enough money&rdquo; for universal health care; complete restructuring of the mental health support system of the ENTIRE country, allowing all children to have education equivalent to what is provided in wealthy districts across the U.S. If we can get some of these things addressed maybe we will be at a point where we can turn Ai fully loose with no regulation, monitoring or restrictions. <br/><br/>Thank you.
