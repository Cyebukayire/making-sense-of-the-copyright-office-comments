I think it needs to be reiterated that content being posted online doesn&#39;t automatically equate to it being completely fair use. AI companies scrape copyrighted works for their own profit without compensation or consent from small creators. AI technolgy is then used to directly compete with those creatives, create exploitative content, scams, etc, and devalues the original works and the people who create them, affecting livelihoods in the US and across the globe. <br/><br/>AI models should be trained on content that is provided with explicit consent, and giving consent for training should not be contingent on the use of any unrelated platforms such as social media and the literal internet. <br/><br/>If AI companies are allowed free range to take anything that exists and incorporate it into AI training models, there will never be any incentive for people to create or share any original works since rights to it will be immediately taken by AI creators/users.<br/><br/>If a significant portion of works are going to be produced by AI, then it&#39;s imperative that the people creating the content on which it is based are significantly compensated. In the same way it&#39;s illegal to create a physical library by stealing books, AI shouldn&#39;t be able to create a database by taking data without consent or compensation.  <br/><br/>Unregulated use of AI and incorporation of creative works into AI will stifle individuals that produce the valuable content on which AI is based.<br/><br/>Unregulated incorporation of online data into AI content:<br/><br/>1. Makes it impossible or at least unfeasible for writers, artists, etc, to advertise any creative works online without their copyrighted works being almost immediately integrated into large models. Artists and creatives don&#39;t automatically have the ability to even give away these rights. The current &quot;finders keepers&quot; model of AI model training makes it a legal liability to advertise works and services online or in digital formats. <br/><br/>2. It sets the stage for monopolies. Only a few companies have the ability to scrape the entire internet in the first place. There is no reason for the entire thing to be up for grabs when public domain content exists. <br/><br/>3. This isn&#39;t completely related to copyright, but it jeopardizes sensitive information, since it is not possible for the large models to be screened for sensitive and private data (medical records, pornography, etc) due to the quantity of material being taken in.<br/><br/>4. The finders keepers model also allows for the creation of data/content to be devalued, since all individuals will effectively have the ability to use any piece of work without paying so long as they run it through the filter of AI beforehand. <br/><br/>5. AI has the potential to make it so that the internet is no longer a place of learning and sharing information, but a place where people go to share copies of copies of information in an automated way for the chance of making money through clicks. <br/><br/>5. Provided a content creator, author, artist, etc, is able to make a name for themselves in the AI landscape, there is nothing stopping an AI user from appropriating their works and image, such as what&#39;s happened with the author Jane Friedman. This will continue to happen as the technology progresses. It makes it incredibly difficult to work. <br/><br/>6. Lack of regulation of content injested by AI will ultimately spell doom for AI created media. As misinformation and AI generated content are injected back into these models, the eventually become prone to repeating false information. People (incorrectly) treat these models as a source of information. The content that goes into them needs to be monitored. I hope your site is using a filter to siphon out pro-ai comments generated automatically. <br/><br/>7. Open season would ultimately devalue private AI models. How can anyone create an AI product using popular models if all the content in each customized model is legally recognized as being up-for-grabs as soon as anyone becomes aware of it?<br/><br/>Overall, when considering if something is fair use:<br/><br/>- the purpose and character of your use<br/>- the nature of the copyrighted work<br/>- the amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and<br/>t- he effect of the use upon the potential market.<br/><br/>AI models, especially the commercial ones, and the content they produce seem to violate all 4 of these points. <br/><br/>The models themselves should not be fair use when they use copyrighted materials. Allowing the resulting works of AI to be copyrighted, especially under current circumstances, would be unmanageable due to the quantity of content that can be produced by AI automatically, and through the frequency with which AI can replicate existing copyrighted material exactly. Furthermore, use of AI does not constitute human authorship. An author contains rights to their novel, even when they are assisted by an editor or marketing team. AI generated works are still created by AI even when a human makes edits to them or enters prompts. <br/>
