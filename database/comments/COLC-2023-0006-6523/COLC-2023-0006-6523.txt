To whom it may concern: I am against the idea of AI&#39;s being trained on copyrighted works. I am also against AI&#39;s being trained on anything that wasn&#39;t given consensually for the AI to train on. This sort of thing represents a serious threat to artists, for many reasons. For one thing, it would steal their unique &#39;voice&#39; and have it be regurgitated to others. For another, it would give corporations and other similar entities an excuse to not emburse artists fairly for their work. Writers and artists are the lifeblood of society, and if they cannot be compensated fairly for their work, or indeed- have their work be stolen unfairly, then the art world may well end up being crippled as a result. Beauty and art is a human, cherished trait. It should not be given to non-humans for cheap and fast reproduction. Because people are fearful of having their art stolen, it also makes them less likely to put it out there, hurting the community. The point of copyright is to allow a creator to profit from their own work. The idea that a non-human entity could have their work copyrighted as original when it is based of of content that doesn&#39;t belong to them seems an egregious error. Artists and photographers are hardworking people who dedicate their lives to mastering their craft. Using our artwork, without consent, to train the tool that replaces us is exploitative and should be illegal. Human creators should have the power to sell or donate our artwork to ai generators if we choose. How, when, and where an artist chooses to use their work should remain their choice entirely. It should be required by law that anything generated by an AI be clearly labeled, so that informed consumers will have a choice on whether or not to support AI. Thank you for your time.
