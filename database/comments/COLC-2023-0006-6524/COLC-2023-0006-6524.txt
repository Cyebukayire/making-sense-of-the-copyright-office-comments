AI or machine learning has capacity to improve and be beneficial. However, the way it has been implemented, has caused concern. Theft of artist&rsquo;s work (art;books etc.) is inexcusable. Use of AI/ML to cut salaries and jobs of employees for a mediocre outcome is inexcusable. We are already seeing that works created by AI/ML (particularly in written statements) are not accurate and are misleading. Theft of peoples work and then butchering that work to create falsehoods is detrimental to American livelihoods and education.
