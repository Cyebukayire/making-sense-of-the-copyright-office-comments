My name is Genesis Sanchez, I am a student at RCC in the art department. Artificial Intelligence should not be recognized as legitimate art and is in violation of copyright. AI has been shown to take from the art styles of multiple artists to &ldquo;create&rdquo; the pieces it spits out. Rather than reward the people who are stealing art, artificial intelligence should be banned as a whole. Since it&rsquo;s also been shows to bleed into and hurt other industries not just the arts. AI has no place in industries where human touch has been ingrained in them for centuries. (Art, Acting, Music) AI should not be able to hold a copyright for the art, voices, or faces it generates.
