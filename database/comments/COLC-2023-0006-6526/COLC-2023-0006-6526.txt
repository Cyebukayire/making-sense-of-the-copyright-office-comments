Respectfully, I don&#39;t believe that AI works can be copyrighted as the programs are trained on copyrighted works and therefore whatever result is generated ir bot fully an original idea. I believe that AI programs generated without the consent of the creators of the original works being used to train the programs would/should actually infringe upon the copyright of those works.
