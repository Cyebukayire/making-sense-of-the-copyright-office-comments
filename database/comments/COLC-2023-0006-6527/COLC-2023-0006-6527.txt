As an artist, I believe AI should only be allowed to use media where the original, human author, illustrator, photographer, etc has given explicit permission for AI use, or if the media is in the public domain. If copyrighted material or non-consentual media is used, it should either be banned from distribution or banned from monetization. At the very least, credit for all the media an AI has used in a piece or paper should be required in order to distribute the AI work, and it should be made very clear that AI was used to make the work. (IE its own category on YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)<br/><br/>AI work should not be allowed to compete in competitions in the se category as human-made work. Nor should it be distributed in the same way.
