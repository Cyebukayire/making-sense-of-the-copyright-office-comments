AI trainers should not be able to use copyright material (art, writing, etc) created by human beings in order to train their AI to produce content unless those companies want to pay the original creator for its use. What is the point of copyright then? It is an unfair practice, where large corporations are effectively profiting off the work of others without compensation to maximize their profits, as usual. Protect the artists! People work hard to create content and allowing it to be stolen in the name of technological advancement is ridiculous.
