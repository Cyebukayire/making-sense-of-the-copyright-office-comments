As someone who enjoys writing, and who has many friends who are artists or voice artists, I believe that creators need to be protected. So-called AI steals from creators, and poses a threat to their ability to earn income for their work. By preventing AI-created work from being viable for copyright, we can discourage corporate powers from taking advantage of AI at the expense of human artists.
