Hello, I would like to add my voice to those who support preventing AI-generated work from being copyrighted. It is virtually impossible to truthfully ascertain whether a given AI has included copyrighted materials in its training datatset; as such, there is no ethical or legal way to determine whether its output constitutes copyright infringement. I believe that AI-generated materials should not be copyrightable, and that safeguards should be put in place to prevent the abuse of intellectual property by AI models. AI represents a powerful tool for human creation but ethical guidelines around it will only be maintained if the federal regulatory body stands firm against misuse of copyright works. Thank you.
