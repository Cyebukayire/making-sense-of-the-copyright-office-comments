While AI generated material can be a good place to start with art, there is a lack of true human input to make it capable of being copyrighted. In order to copyright a piece, you must be able to demonstrate a significant change from anything generated: a cleaning up and refinement of the design is not enough. The design may take into account things that were generated, but any generated material must no longer be directly recognizable as a 1:1, as if someone had painted directly over a photo to create the same image. There should be significant differences in composition, pose, color choice and intent, and relations to the AI generated content should be unrecognizable.
