AI steals people&#39;s work, period.  Many people&#39;s &quot;styles&quot; are the reason they get hired, and having a machine that mass consumes art it scrapes from the internet, or is intentionally fed a creator&#39;s work from a user, greatly impacts their ability to make a living.<br/><br/>In order for it to be more &quot;ethical&quot; it should be legally mandated that entities have to expressly ask for permission to use people&#39;s work, whether it be art, photography or writing &mdash; and it shouldn&#39;t be hidden in a company&#39;s TOS or uses dark UI patterns where the approval is already marked.  It must to be something people explicitly are made aware and agree to, and companies shouldn&#39;t be allowed to scrape the internet for content.  Just because someone&#39;s writing, or art, etc, is free to view doesn&#39;t imply it&#39;s free to steal.  Plus, it would reduce the issues that has been plaguing AI services where there&#39;s child pornography or virulent bigotry unless someone is uploading it on purpose, which then could be tracked down.
