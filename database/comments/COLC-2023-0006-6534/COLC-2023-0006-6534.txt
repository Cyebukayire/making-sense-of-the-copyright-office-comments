AI content (and specifically machine learning content) should not be copyrightable. It is not an original work, as even the most complicated algorithms currently available are merely copying sets of data points from other works in order to roughly combine them, and often times use or copy other&#39;s copyrighted works without permission to create the work they are making. The fact of the matter is that AI only combines already-established data points and copyrighted materials together in a way that follows a set of parameters, and thus cannot be transformative enough to be copyrighted.
