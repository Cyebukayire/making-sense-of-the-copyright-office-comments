I think that people should NOT be able to use other&#39;s work for training AI. It should be illegal as it is effectively stealing for profit. AI is all stealing and regurgitating people&#39;s copyrighted works for people to see. You should not be able to profit from generative AI in any sense. AI images is also stealing other&#39;s copyrighted photos and art pieces and merging them to make a piece of work. I think that nobody should be able to profit and use AI in the United States. AI also contributes to climate change, which is a massive deal. They waste all this energy on having a program create something, while they put no effort in on their end. <br/><br/>The idea that the person came up with the prompt and should be able to hold copyrights to the image because of that is frankly stupid. Because they didn&#39;t do any of the work to get the file besides type in a few words, should be grounds enough to say they don&#39;t get copyright protections. They did not draw, or write, or record what the end product was. The use of AI puts artists at risk of losing a job to nobody. If AI replaces everyone except the already rich, they will be able to profit with no labor, and more people will become homeless and lose their jobs.<br/><br/>For the sake of America&#39;s workforce, ban generative AI.
