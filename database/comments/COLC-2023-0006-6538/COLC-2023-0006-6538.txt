I believe that AI generated work should be treated the same way work created by a real person is treated.  <br/><br/>For example, if all AI can do is create graphics that resemble the work of other artists (i.e., the training data), it is essentially plagiarism and would be copyright infringement.  All of the examples I have seen in various press articles definitely fall into that category; so, one must assume that the current state of AI technology is pretty much just automated plagiarism.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is always possible that some future improved technology could be trained with all of the art available in the world and be able to synthesize something truly original.  I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath on that one, but breakthroughs do occasionally happen...
