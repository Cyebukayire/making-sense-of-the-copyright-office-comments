Content &quot;created&quot; by artificial intelligence should be considered, at best, derivative work--derivative of the data set used to train the artificial intelligence. At worst (and this has already been encountered, in cases where generated text or image effectively recreates pre-existing images/writings from the data set exactly), AI-generated work is inefficient theft. Until the creators of the content used to train the AI models are properly attributed and compensated, any further discussion of granting copyright to generated material should be moot.
