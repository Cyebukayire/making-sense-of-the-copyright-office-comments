AI art and writing, and any other form it ventures into, doesn&#39;t exist without source material taken without the creator&#39;s consent. The owners of these databases have admitted that they didn&#39;t ask for permission before trawling the internet as a whole to take their &quot;data&quot; that this AI was trained on. I&#39;ve actively seen artists getting fewer commissions or losing clients due to them deciding to use AI instead. This is already actively affecting livelihoods. And these AI are entirely hinged on stealing the material used to train them in the first place. They shouldn&#39;t be allowed to get away with or continue stealing and trying to replace the artists, writers, and other creatives that they stole from.
