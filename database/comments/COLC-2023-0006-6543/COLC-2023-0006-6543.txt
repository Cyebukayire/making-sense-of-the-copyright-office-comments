AI is being developed too quickly and used the wrong ways. AI voices that copy real voice actors, political figures, and celebrities. are can be made say things that slander those people, or take away revenue from them. Similarly, AI generated art takes revenue away from human artists that work in the same style. I heard whole books are generated from AI in the style of specific authors, then are credited as by said author. The books aren&#39;t as of quality by the author, but gets the same attention as if by that author while none of the revenue goes to them.<br/>What an AI generates is based off its training data. If the training data is copyrighted material, then the AI will make content similar to the copyrighted material, an the aim of AI is to become closer to said material to become indistinguishable. The creators of the AI need the permission of the holder to use the material, and another to distribute the generated content. Or, the content generated by AI should be fair use, because it was made by a machine and not a human.
