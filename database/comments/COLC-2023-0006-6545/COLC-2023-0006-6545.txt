My works and the works of my peers have been stole and used to train AI models to mimic my every move. There have been countless cases of AI being used to unrightfully copy the works of myself and others, and I firmly believe it infringes on the rights of my creations, the creations of others, and my privacy overall. I believe AI should be outlawed for commercial use, or at least heavily regulated so as to not be trained on the works, voices, and talents of humans.
