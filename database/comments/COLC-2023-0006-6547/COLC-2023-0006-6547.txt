As an independent game studio, we have seen our business and contractors we work with adversely affected by misuse of AI generation of images, audio, and voice. It creates unwanted, low quality media that competes with human-made creative endeavors, often without the knowledge or approval of the artists that have been exploited for its datasets. It removes the human element from the art, and commodifies exploitation of the talent which has been used to generate its products.  Additionally, it has become difficult to easily screen AI generated art and media from being submitted through contractors, potentially compromising the integrity of our work.
