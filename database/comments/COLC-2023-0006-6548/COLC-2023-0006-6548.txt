I would personally love for human talent to continue to work on projects. Human talent is important and artificial intelligence can mimic only a fraction of the same effort and passion that real people do. Not to mention, AI-generated stuff generally looks ugly and disrespects talented actors, writer, artists, and people in genreal. Just having the people try and &quot;fix&quot; generated media just to get copyright approval is a gigantic no-no. They should just be involved from the very start, and in no way should they be scanned for data either. AI should personally stay as far away from film, TV, music, and video games as possible, and AI-genreated meda should remain ineligible for copyright and trademark. Let the people continue to work! They shall not be replaced!
