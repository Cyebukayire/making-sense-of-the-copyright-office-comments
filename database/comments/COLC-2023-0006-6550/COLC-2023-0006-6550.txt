I&#39;m writing in today to urge lawmakers not to allow creative projects created entirely by AI programs (such as visual works made with stable diffusion or written projects by LLMs like chatGPT). There are four main reasons why, and the first is arguably the more pressing matter in this discussion: job security and industry shifts.<br/><br/>Right now we have undeniable proof of record profits across the board for several industries despite the damages the COVID pandemic caused and rising inflation. And yet these same corporations are turning around and laying off employees by the thousands (T-Mobile after their merger with Sprint, and various publishing houses both immediately come to mind). This is because corporations do not see their employees as people. They see them as numbers and bills.<br/><br/>I point this out because I want every single person listening to, or reading this comment, to think very carefully as to why so many tech sector corporations want AI creations to be granted copyright. They would not fight this hard for it if they didn&#39;t see a gold mine laying in wait. That gold mine is the final cost cutting step to eliminating as many human employed jobs as possible to cut costs and raise profits at the expense of the American people. <br/><br/>We can see it right now in Hollywood and the entertainment industry. One of the main sticking points of the SAG-AFTRA actors strike is that studios wish to digitally scan the likeness of actors to use them posthumously in any way they wish, for only a one time payment $200 USD. This not only cuts off any hope of further training to land more acting jobs in the future, but on a moral level it disrespects the humanity of the person being digitized. These corporations want to use literal ghosts of dead people rather than spend the money to hire new talent. We&#39;ve already seen it in action with films like Star Wars and The Flash.<br/><br/>Netflix, if that company has its way, will also strip human authorship of any credit despite reaping the benefits of AI being granted copyright. In the animated film &quot;Dog and Boy&quot; Netflix Japan had the audacity to credit the film as made by &quot;AI + Human.&quot; And the excuse of the studio was to combat a labor shortage of their own making in Japan by refusing to pay animators a higher living wage.<br/><br/>That is already also happening here in the US. We do not have a labor shortage. We have a shortage of corporations willing to pay the American people an actual living wage (yet they demand we buy their products). If AI works are granted copyright this problem will worsen. They want one or two people managing an AI model, not a team of animation staff or actors. <br/><br/>And I&#39;m sure lawmakers and supporters of AI will tell you people just need to be educated and switch to a new industry. The problem with that logic is that not one single industry is safe from this technology. Publishing houses, voice over companies (video games and audio books), the music industry (see the AI vocalist with a record deal), and retailers like Amazon are all silently adding clauses in their contracts to digitize their freelancer&#39;s work and use them to train AI models so that they don&#39;t have to hire that person or purchase the distribution rights to their work ever again.<br/><br/>The second reason is that these learning models are a data privacy nightmare. We&#39;ve seen countless examples in social media of corporations like OpenAI have obtained data from dubious sources, including literal grocery list receipts among the hoard of copyrighted materials. They do not care, and you will not be able to keep up the vigil necessary to make sure they don&#39;t continue to collect data they don&#39;t need.<br/><br/>My final reason is morality: there is hundreds of years worth of, both artistic and written, works in the public domain that could have been used to train these models. AI works in general would be fine as public domain entities. But that was not good enough for them. I return to point number one: these corporations do not care about the human spirit and how we as a community find solace and understand our world through art. They see us as numbers to erase from their quarterly bills. They want to own everything, down to the right to be creative in the first place while leaving everyone else to flounder. <br/><br/>This is all just the tip of the iceberg. I haven&#39;t even touched on how &quot;AI artists&quot; or &quot;AI writers&quot; aren&#39;t even doing the actual work, or how current data sets only worsen the divide between media created representing white people and those of BIPOC minorities. But I wanted to focus the 5000 characters I have on points I wasn&#39;t sure my fellow commenters would touch. I want those more informed than I am to touch on those subjects instead.<br/><br/>Once again: I implore everyone taking the time to listen or read my words today to really look at who is pro AI works receiving copyright and who isn&#39;t. Because chances are you&#39;ll find there&#39;s some common threads. Thank you for your time today.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
