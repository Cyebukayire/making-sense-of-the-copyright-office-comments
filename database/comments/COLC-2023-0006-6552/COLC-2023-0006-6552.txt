AI is the embodiment of the death of any creative industry. It is a scourge on the concept of human achievement, and at no point should any work derived from or generated by AI be considered for copyright by any means. If you are allowing individuals to hold copyright over anything generated with AI, you are allowing mass theft to take place with the help of a massively available product. It is exploitative and objectively immoral to allow such things to be considered for copyright, and doing so would be a mockery of the copyright system altogether.
