Y Combinator Companies and large tech monopolies like Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, OpenAI, Midjourney, CommonCrawl, LAION, etc have been exploiting and using people&#39;s public &amp; private information for their own profit without permission and compensation to train their company&#39;s commercial Machine Learning Products.  <br/>These companies are infringing on copyright; violating HIPAA; exploiting children; enabling scammers &amp; hackers &amp; businesses to profit off data that they stole and do not have license to use.<br/><br/>Copyright should be only for human made works, but humans rights are being violated by generative AI due to companies making dataset off everything off the web. <br/>Companies should be fined heavily due to lack of accountability and enabling no safety moderations over their datasets &amp; algorithms.<br/>Datasets need to be purged and regulated &amp; audited only using licensed &amp; compensated data (OPT-IN only) <br/><br/>Even so every person should have the right to control their data, their public image, and copyright from be removed from these datasets, but companies refuse to be transparent.  Even if they are transparent, that is not enough regulation to solve the issue of theft &amp; mass unemployment &amp; unfair wages &amp; exploitation in the creative sectors (ex. SAGAFTRA strike)<br/>These companies also need to be held accountable, and should not be able to use research or fair use to create their products based on stolen property.<br/><br/>We also cannot give these tech companies the power to self-regulate; they continually put lives in danger for profits as believe they control all of the data freely, and that needs to stop. <br/>An AI checker is not feasible due to it needing to train on data (AI data which is trained on stolen human data) and also not reliable due to how inaccurate it is, and proven not to work (for example, AI has labeled the US Constitution as written by AI). <br/>Even if we force AI to be labeled, AI businesses will continue to not label their AI products as such as there is no AI checker to dispute them (also because they can always create more false evidence to protect them) &amp; AI businesses are the only ones who can create such AI, meaning this is just self-regulation that does not work and fall in their favor. <br/><br/>Tech companies &amp; TESCREAL cultist want AI to have copyrights which is a human right, but their beliefs is based on anti-human rights with racist, sexist, eugenicist roots which we should not be supporting.<br/><br/>We should follow copyright laws and protect human rights &amp; victims who are being trained on deserved to be paid and have control over their IP. Tech companies &amp; AI &amp; third parties are abusing their power &amp; are not above copyright law. <br/><br/>Some sites, articles &amp; papers about artists &amp; medical patients &amp; people being harmed by AI companies<br/>https://www.createdontscrape.com/<br/>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681<br/>https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/<br/>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01963 <br/>https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/111528<br/>https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkadgm/man-dies-by-suicide-after-talking-with-ai-chatbot-widow-says<br/>https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-being-used-hacking-misinfo-top-canadian-cyber-official-says-2023-07-20/<br/>https://petapixel.com/2022/12/21/midjourny-founder-admits-to-using-a-hundred-million-images-without-consent/
