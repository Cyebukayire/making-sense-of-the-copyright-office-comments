The use of AI is beneficial only when used in scenarios such as simulation, prompt generating, and in uses such as automatic replies (customer service bots, FAQ bots, etc.) The use of AI in industries such as Art, Writing, Movie directing (including forms of animation, forms of script, and forms of cgi) should not be allowed unless EVERY SINGLE PERSON who&#39;s work is being fed INTO the ai has written, official consent and should be PAID as their work is being imitated, used, and uncredited. In uses such as photo editing, writing editors (auto correct functions), and mapping soft wares, Ai can be useful but should be limited, as long as other works aren&rsquo;t being stolen or used illegally by said software. <br/>AI being used in the economy is DISASTROUS and will lose many Americans their already little jobs, America thrived on it&rsquo;s art, why should people be allowed to take that away by stealing?
