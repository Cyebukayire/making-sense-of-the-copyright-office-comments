At this moment in time all artificial intelligence models for &quot;creating&quot; creative works rely heavily on datasets harvested without permission from mostly protected (copyrighted) sources. Almost all of these companies refuse to elaborate on where the data they gathered has come from, some even saying that revealing where they got it from would &quot;open them up to legal challenges&quot;. Beyond that, the closest approximation to what someone entering a prompt into a machine and getting a product spat out at them resembles is when an artist is paid and a contract is written wherein the artist uses their skills to create a work and when payment and contract are exchanged and signed, it is now owned by the commissioner. <br/><br/>Except there is no contract. A person coming up with a prompt that is acted upon by something else which isn&#39;t even human, and then the human who only contributed a vague list of words trying to claim they own the copyright is obviously ludicrous. It is very much similar to the case of the photographer who gave a monkey a camera that he used to photograph himself, or a human giving paint, paintbrushes, and canvases to elephants to paint. The human handed tools (in the case of AI, a list of prompts) over to a non-human entity that did all of the &quot;work&quot; for them.<br/><br/>Beyond that these robots are not actually &quot;intelligent&quot; in the way that a person is. They cannot reason, they do not actually &quot;learn&quot; like how people learn. If someone set a candle shop on fire the fire did not make a new candle by melting all the ones inside into one massive pile of wax. That&#39;s all AI does. It absorbs datapoints about what certain things look like and uses attached words to create a pattern that can be called upon. It does not understand color theory, it does not understand shape theory, none of them have the capability to use continuity, ones that write do not know about theming or motifs in storytelling.<br/><br/>In practice I do not believe AI will ever be good enough to do what talented and hard working humans can do. They can only spit out things that are &quot;good enough&quot; which will then need to be cleaned up and edited by real humans, and in the end it will be a way to exploit those with creative talents. Why pay a writer to write a book when you can pay one far less to edit one written by an AI? Who cares if the book is almost entirely incomprehensible which means the editing needing to be done is far greater than almost anything a human-made book would need.<br/><br/>It will also hurt consumers. AI is already being used to generate subtitles and I have noticed, other people have noticed. Words will be wrong, sentences won&#39;t make sense, and actual subtitlers who are already paid terribly for the hard work they do are being paid even less to just edit whatever nonsense the AI thinks it hears. Some people have found AI books being sold on Amazon and when they look through them the stories are incomprehensible. I cannot overstate how bad AIs are at making extended narratives and creating thoughtful storytelling through design or theming. Allowing AI work to be copyrighted is allowing a purposeful degradation of art to be sold at the expense of those who would buy it, and those who could make better work for true compensation and in more time.
