Artificial Inelligence, most notably in the feild of entertainment has been doing a great amount of harm to the daily lives of people in creative positions. This includes artists, who have had their artworks used without permission or proper credit as well as Voixe actors whose voices are being taken away and stolen without permission. <br/><br/>AI is being blatantly trained on the voices and the artwork of people who do not give consent to these more often than not, and in the current climate, without any proper regulation, makes it hard to make the argument that these are blatant copyright infringment on a persons own vocal and artistic identity.
