I would like to declare that I am an artist that uses many mediums and styles and while I see the advantages of using AI to lessen labor or reduce injury the simply fact is that unless there are safeguards set up to protect human artist that the law agrees hold copyright over their own individual works it would be a great injustice to not have those rules for copyright to be kept clear and concise on what being a &quot;human means&quot;. Copyright will no doubt change over the years and centuries and while jobs are not basic human rights, the damage would be far too significant for those people to receive the help they deserve. Also if a company does us AI during any part of their operations, they must declare it as AI cannot and will never be perfect. It will always make suggestions based on the data it is being fed, though not unlike people, and could cause travesty if it&#39;s suggested data is taken as fact and implemented wherever they so choose. If responsibility is to be expected of every single person when it comes to laws, it should be the same with any system AI or human. The law states humans are the only things that have a protected copyright currently and unless the courts want to consider wages and welfare given to animals in zoos or exhibits, I hope everyone will do well to consider the wider implications of the laws they set forward.
