Ai may be our future, but it is stealing from the present. These &quot;chat Ai&quot; programs are not being taught writing how it should, by its users and public use documents (i.e dictionaries, FREE articles, primary source doc&#39;s, ECT) teaching it, but instead it is being given free reign of the entire written content of the internet. These AI&#39;s have been scrapping through archive sites, fanfiction sites, and many more places. Normally if this was a person instead of a robot, the person who have been placed under suspension by the sites or deplatformed by the ones who are getting stolen from. They may be creative writing content available for anyone to see, but it distorts what the Ai&#39;s learn. People, like you and I, have free reign of the mind. Robots do not. We can separate what is real and what is fake, while the Ai will treat everything as completely factual. When this comes to writing, it becomes dangerous because anyone can say anything. If a Ai that starts making threats and being aggressive, it&#39;s shut down instantly, by with theses creative writing Ai&#39;s they&#39;re just let free. So, not only will it become dangerous, but eventually everything will be cycled through over and over again. There will no longer be anything original. An Ai might re-right J.K Rowling&#39;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; but instead of them being British, they&#39;re all American, and no one will think the wiser. Not only would that be a GREAT  violation of copyright, but it&#39;s not even original. How chat Ai&#39;s have been programmed is theft, even if it is just &quot;internet content&quot;. There are better ways to teach the Ai&#39;s, but the programmers are just allowing their codes to steal other people&#39;s hard earned work. They&#39;re putting jobs at risk, it may even collapse the economy worse that it has been.
