If a generative AI model is trained on copyrighted content then anything produced by that ai should be in part owned by the copyright holder of the original piece used in training. Using generated content to commercial purposes is in essence using a piece of the original content just like sampling a song or quoting text, the original creator must be cited/compensated/acknowledged and should have some ownership of the generated content.
