AI should not operate in a way that &quot;learns&quot; from things without explicit consent, as things people create-- art, both digital and traditional, designs, even people&#39;s VOICES are being stolen and replicated and it is destroying work and work ethic besides. With the working climate already as it is with people daring to claim there are people who &quot;don&#39;t want to work&quot; when the height of covid showed us that remote work and fair wages CAN be provided, shouldn&#39;t we be doing everything to protect those who want to work? AI when learning without blatant, explicit, and constant consent from the things it learns from is theft, plain and simple, and it needs to stop.
