Transformative and innovative technologies do not give us warning when they arrive, whether in the public or as citizens it very much feels like we have started the most important day of our lives snoozing through an alarm clock and waking up at 2pm. That being said, I recommend and commend the collaborative approach you&#39;re taking by allowing public comments, and I hope it&#39;s something we&#39;re able to circle back to on the quite massive RAID log that the undertaking of this project will be. As for myself I appreciate this incredible opportunity to be heard and I&#39;d like to make 3 opinionated points that I hope to bring convincingly to you. I believe we should force large billion-dollar institutions to engage in ethical behavior when sourcing AI training. I believe we should not discourage innovation, but also not allow it to be too profitable and get out of control, while these models are clearly transformative there should be room in regulation to allow profitable lawsuits to encourage model-creators to be wise about what it is they release. I believe we should be wary that these technologies can be existentially risky and include academics and ethicists in these discussions. I believe that we should evaluate models individually because they are non-deterministic and they are not all the same (sometimes). I believe in open-source and understand that it contradicts some of these other concerns.<br/><br/>Navigating AI is analogous to constructing a house with just a hammer; we might require additional tools. Yet, this hammer can be instrumental in three areas:<br/><br/>Legally Acquired Training Data - the foundation of our metaphorical house. Constructing a solid home requires legally and ethically sourced materials. The same principle applies to AI. Ensuring a legitimate legal framework is paramount. By mandating transparency about data sources&mdash;primarily for regulatory bodies&mdash;we bolster the doctrine of fair use. We must recognize that advanced learning models process copyrighted data and transform it dramatically. This transformative process shouldn&rsquo;t be subject to copyright any more than the collective knowledge an M.D. accumulates throughout their education.<br/><br/>AI Outputs and Overregulation - Think of AI outputs as watering a garden. Overwatering harms more than it nurtures. Similarly, excessive regulation on AI outputs, especially those innovating beyond their training parameters, risks stifling growth and innovation. The key is balanced oversight.<br/><br/>Open Research and Its Implications - The potential risks posed by advanced AI are undeniable. Yet, we must view each AI model as a distinct ecosystem. Their unpredictable outputs suggest that traditional precedents might not always apply. However, it&#39;s essential that these models remain open for study and understanding, not only for regulators but for society at large. Embracing this challenging path might be demanding, but often the most arduous routes yield the most rewarding outcomes.<br/><br/>In closing, traversing the AI-copyright intersection presents significant challenges. But with collaborative efforts, I&#39;m hopeful we can establish a solid framework for the future.<br/><br/>Warmest Regards,<br/><br/>Josh Smith
