I have stopped all passive income creations (Custom Calendars, Digital Prints of Original Artwork, art commissions, short stories, etc.) due to the influx of AI generated artwork not only flooding the market, but learning from and profiting off my name and style.<br/><br/>Websites and third party vendors like X/Twitter, Etsy, Facebook, WritWord, and other sites who have embraced AI generated and Data mining practices have made it impossible to track, report, and remove AI generated works that spoof of my original works. The income I have lost from this source of income has crippled my ability to afford food and water on a monthly basis, (as my main source of income covers the already expensive rent), and to cover the cost of materials used in the protection of my art.<br/><br/>Because AI has over-saturated the market I have deleted my accounts on every site I used, what remains online are the spoof and knock off accounts that have plagiarized my work. As I feel there is no point in selling my work online when it gets repeatedly stolen, barely modified, and resold at scab prices. I don&#39;t even trust the operators reading this comment to not steal any files I would have uploaded for personal gain!!!<br/><br/>AI needs to be removed entirely from the creative sphere, and all it&#39;s data that it was trained on: from it&#39;s first introduction online to the moment regulations are enacted: every site needs to be expunged from the AI generated works. AI utilizes need to get permission and pay the original artists the fees their art stole from, as well as copyright/use rights for their programs training. <br/><br/>Opting out of being Data Mined for training needs to be an easy to reach setting on EVERY site online. Third Party servers like Etsy should make it clear that there are AI generated and Original Human Works on their sites and allow people to filter their products accordingly. People who use AI should not be allowed to claim &quot;original work&quot; for inputting a few choice words into a program and selling off the regurgitated remains. Nor should ANY profit be maid from completely AI generated products (Unless the robot itself is capable of making purchases for it&#39;s needs and maintenance like I am paying for food and water. SI really should be called Statistical Amalgimation)
