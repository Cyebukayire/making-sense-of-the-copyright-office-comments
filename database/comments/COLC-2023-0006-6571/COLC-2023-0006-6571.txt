The single largest risk to society from AI is one where the powerful have a monopoly over AI. We cannot afford to deny US innovators complete, unshackled access to this revolutionary technology without censorship or outside control. The rest of the world will simply fly past us if that happens- if you ban us from using AI to its fullest extent, China still will. Technology and culture will advance regardless of anyone&#39;s participation or permission. You would not be ruling on AI; you would be ruling on whether clinging to the expired idea of intellectual property and bad actors&#39; desire to control speech are more important than the security of the US economy, and the freedom of its people.
