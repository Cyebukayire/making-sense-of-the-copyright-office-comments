Hello! I personally do not believe that AI generated art/images/video should be available to copyright because I think it puts small artists at risk of lawsuits as well as while it can be argued that there is forethought put into AI SEO art, it is not made personally by the artist themselves-it is generated based off of data pulled from the internet. <br/><br/>In regards to small artists, every digital artist knows the struggle of their art being reposted without their permission and the way that this causes them to lose profits that the scammers who took the art then garner. Due to the fact that digital artists, despite their best efforts, can have their artwork stolen, it is not a large leap to realize that an AI training on a site with stolen art (a site that artists have not agreed to have their art on) can then replicate or even duplicate original artwork and claim it as a random AI generation. This then puts the small artist in a difficult position if their art, through the AI, is now copyrighted, and they cannot dispute this as the AI is supposed to be referential as opposed to simply copying. However, AI cannot do anything more than copy. It has not original inspiration of it&#39;s own, it has hardwired algorithms that put together existing ideas in an attempt to fill a command. It does not produce new material, it recycles old material-and in the worst of cases, steals old material in an attempt to hodgepodge together a decent product. <br/><br/>In my opinion, if we cannot control the sources of our AI SEO to be ethical, free to use art, then we cannot in good conscience allow AI art to be copyrighted as it perpetuates and institutionalizes the theft of small artists&#39; work.<br/><br/>Art is an integral part of being human. To make and experience art is a necessity of life and if we are to support art and artists, we must choose to stand behind them in times like this and affirm that their work is valued enough to be protected and treated with dignity. I believe that one day AI art can be a medium sitting alongside oil paintings and marble stautes, but not as it is right now. It is too unrefined and new with many pitfalls and so I implore you all to please deny copyright for AI art until such time as it is ready to be it&#39;s own art form without having to steal from the many artists who choose to share their art on the internet. Take a stand in solidarity for artists today and in the future and please vote against allowing AI copyright.
