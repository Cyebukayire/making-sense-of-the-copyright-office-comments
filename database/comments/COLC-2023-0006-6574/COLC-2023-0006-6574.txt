If AI isn&#39;t against the letter of copyright law, it is against its spirit. Copyright is supposed to protect and incentivize art and culture, and AI violates that at every level. It uses data scraped from a creation to replace the creator. Previous lawsuits may have ruled that using statistical information from a work was admissible under fair use, but until now the data gathered wasn&#39;t capable of replicating an artist&#39;s work and driving them out of business. Copyright law needs to be adjusted to account for this new technology--nothing like this has existed before, and we need to be flexible if we want to continue protecting art. <br/><br/>I&#39;m an illustrator working in table top art, and I&#39;ve already started to see AI chipping away at entry level work in the field. I understand that at some level this progress is inevitable, but if an artist&#39;s copyright prevented AI scraping, then living artists would have a buffer where they could create work unlike anything existing in the AI&#39;s databases. If artists&#39; copyright doesn&#39;t prevent AI scraping, than I worry we will see fewer artists able to make a living, unable to compete with the machines that feed off their work.
