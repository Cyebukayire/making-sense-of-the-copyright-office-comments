I believe that AI desperately needs regulation for the good of all creatives across the board. As of right now, I think using AI is unethical and immoral for generating art in any form or medium because of the lack of consent from the creatives that AI blatantly rips off. This directly steals money from the creatives it rightfully belongs to and highly discourages the innovation and success of the arts. I think the developers of AI are directly piggybacking off of the years expertise, dedication, and love that artists put into their craft in order to put millions upon millions of dollars into their own pockets, a reality that only gets exponentially worse each day that AI goes unregulated. The people who continue to develop AI know what they are doing and do not care, with nothing currently in place to stop them. I implore that AI be regulated as soon as possible. It shouldn&rsquo;t be regulated out of existence, but needs necessary copyright and consent laws imposed on them to require both the consent and compensation of the artists they draw work from. This is necessary for the heath of the arts not only in the US, but across the globe.
