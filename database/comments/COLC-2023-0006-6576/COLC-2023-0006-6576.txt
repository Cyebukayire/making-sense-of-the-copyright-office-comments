Artificial intelligence in blatant theift. There is so computer learning to craft these works as a human could. It is simply fed stolen material and at best collaging it together. Allowing it to exist will destroy creative industries and take the soul of art and the beauty of its process. Please remember how much art has given humans up until this point.
