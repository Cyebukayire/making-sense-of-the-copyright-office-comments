Hello, I am an author who posts their work online. I am very unhappy with the idea of AI being able to freely use my own work for other people. If AI is allowed to take my work without permission or compensation where does one draw the line? Can AI work be copyrighted? If AI used my work and someone copyrighted that, do I get part of that? Or is it no longer my work? Can one get around copyright laws by using AI?
