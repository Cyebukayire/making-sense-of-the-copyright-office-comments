People&#39;s voices are being used to train synthetic voice and AI models without our consent, or even more importantly, our knowledge. Companies and individuals need to be fully transparent about their intention to use synthetic voice/AI models now or ever in the future, as this is a genre of work that is paid and can be negotiated. Anything other than transparency in contracts should be able to met with legal action.<br/><br/>AI models and synthetic voices are trained on work/parts of another human being that belong to other people. These people often do not make money on, or consent to, their work or body being used in this way. These works should not be able to be copyrighted in the slightest, because the people who are being used to train these models are not being paid or included in these agreements, when their work is clearly being used. Only if the people behind the work can be paid, that&#39;s when AI models and synthetic voices can be copyrighted.<br/><br/>Finally, in general, more regulations and restrictions are needed on AI models and synthetic voices. People are able to use other people&#39;s works/body in targeted harassment campaigns against the individual to make them say or create things that they didn&#39;t create. This is quickly becoming a threat not just among professionals, but among minors as well where bullying is rampant. This is being used as a threat against other students, purely because they don&#39;t like each other. Meanwhile, it has detrimental ramifications to make a student do or say something against the school&#39;s code of conduct, and the school has no way to prove or disprove that it happened. There needs to be legal repercussions for something like this.
