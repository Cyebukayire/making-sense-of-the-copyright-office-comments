Artificial Intelligence (AI) should not be carelessly used. People are using it to take someone&#39;s work and reconstructing it for their own gain, and it is done unethically as the work they are taking is done without the original creator&#39;s consent. People&#39;s voices should not be used for the purpose of AI, especially without their consent. Artists should not have their work taken and thrown into AI without their consent either. It should also not be monetized.<br/><br/>It should not matter if it is done &quot;for fun&quot; or not. I think the use of AI should be illegal if the work that is used for it is stolen, used without consent, and monetized.
