I am a VFX (visual effects) Artist currently working for the Pok&eacute;mon Company International (my views are my own). As such, what concerns me most is AI-generated imagery. I believe that while AI is a technology with great potential, that we must prioritize the human experience whenever possible. <br/><br/>AI is extremely efficient at what it&rsquo;s trained to do. This means that it can paint an incredible picture that would take me weeks of effort, in seconds. This is bittersweet. On one had, I believe that any intellectual progress is good, and that I can learn from AI as well. On the other hand, it takes the wind out of my sails. A robot programmed to do what I love&hellip; and it&rsquo;s far better and faster. How can an artist not feel jealous? Despondent? Tired. <br/>Those emotions are why I believe that the human must always be prioritized over AI in matters of artistic freedom. The same way technological leaps like infrastructure advancements can limit the great wilderness, AI advancements will limit human creativity. So please, make it harder to use AI for creative purposes! Prioritize humans! We are the ones that need art to help our hearts and souls. We never had the choice to consent to our art being used to fuel a machine that can make our jobs redundant.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;ve attached some of my personal art. These images came from my heart. My art fills me with joy when I create it. AI can recreate it in moments and steal my job with ease. How is this fair at all?<br/><br/>We should be making AI do the boring work, not the creative work! <br/><br/>Thank you for reading.
