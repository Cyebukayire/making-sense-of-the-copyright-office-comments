AI creations should not be allowed to be copyrighted. Furthermore, protection against AI should be established as to avoid infringement upon original creators&#39; rights. AI has positive potential, but unfortunately it appears to be more harmful than good at this stage. It has proven to be racist/biased/easily swayed/inaccurate. AI reform needs to happen &amp; in some instances, banned entirely in terms of making executive decisions like hiring/firing, screening, basing &amp; utilizing someone else&#39;s work as the root of a &quot;new&quot; creation for profit &amp; put in positions of general power that could mean life or death (a recent AI recipe maker put together lethal combinations, for example). AI is too reckless &amp; harmful to be considered a viable asset at this stage &amp; needs regulation &amp; fine tuning. Regardless of that, no work made by it should be allowed to be protected when the real protective rights need to remain with the individual artists used to leech ideas from. In fact, AI is violating their rights &amp; the privacy rights of the public in its collection of data. Allowing it any rights means the destruction of livelihoods &amp; creative integrity of human beings. It cannot be stressed enough how dangerous &amp; unethical AI can be as a whole, without the added negligence it&#39;d mean to offer it any form of protection. Therefore, simply stated NO, AI should not be allowed to be copyrighted by/in/for anything whatsoever.
