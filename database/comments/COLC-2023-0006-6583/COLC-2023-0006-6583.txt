As an illustrator and artist I feel like AI &quot;art&quot; is a direct threat to my livelihood that preys upon the work of others and myself and has no intrinsic value or merit other than disenfranchising human works and jobs. It is transformative yes but it seeks to replace the original in its methods and should not be allowed the same validity as a skilled laborer. The only way AI &quot;art&quot; grows is by consuming and excreting the works of human beings who worked and trained for years to hone their skill in the creative field and would be nothing without them, without us it would be nothing and that alone should be all that is needed to show that it is not worthy of any legal protections.
