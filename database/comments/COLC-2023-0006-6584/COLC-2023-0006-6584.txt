AI has severely impacted my work and safety as a woman. As a voice actress, my voice, and many other&#39;s in my field, have been stolen and replicated into AI. Content I would have otherwise been paid to do has now been replaced with synthesized voices to avoid having to pay the artists who&#39;s vocals and talents they are still using. This is dangerous, morally corrupt, and will only hurt the economy (outside my work) in the long run. As a woman, i have to avoid letting perverted individuals steal my likeness in both image and voice for pornographic material. Such material I would never condone or consent to. <br/>AI can be a wonderful tool to aid in human creation, but right now the open access to it with no regulation is making it replace our creation. Even as we are as individuals, people will our likeness for their own gain. No one is safe.
