AI generated images shouldn&#39;t be regulated under the copyright laws because there is no human behind the its creation.<br/>AI prompters has as much impact in the final product as a client commissioning an idea to an artist, in  wich case the copiright belong to the artist. <br/>The &quot;artist&quot; in this case, not being a legal person on the law, has no right to own copyright or transfer the copyright to anyone else. <br/><br/>On a side note: in my opinion. AI generative image programs should legally leave a trace that identify such image as an AI product to avoid scams and impersonation issues.
