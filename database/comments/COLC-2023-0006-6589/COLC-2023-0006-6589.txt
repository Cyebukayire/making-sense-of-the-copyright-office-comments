As an artist, I am very concerned with how AI is currently being used against human-created works. AI is being used to swipe a multitude of existing human-created artworks and cobble them together into something the AI user hopes to make a profit off of without having to pay any artists. In short, it&#39;s just plain, old-fashioned greed in the form of a complex version of art theft. If this type of AI must exist, then the regulations I would like to see put in place would be for an opt-in system, and opt-in ONLY. Any AI user must obtain express permission from EVERYONE whose creative works they intend to sample before generating an image or other work, and the copyright must belong to all of the people whose creative works were sampled. Nothing not made by humans should be able to be copyrighted, and no one should be allowed to profit off of the labor (creative or otherwise) of others without fairly compensating them.<br/>Thank you for your consideration.
