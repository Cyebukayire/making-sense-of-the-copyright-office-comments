I am a professional voice actor and I love my work and bringing characters to life and having fun with my job, but it&#39;s been scary seeing people take my voice via AI and turning into into something else- making it say whatever they want. It&#39;s uncanny and unprofessional. It is getting to a point where it is getting so close, people mistake these AI sound files for something I said for real. It is not only a threat to my job, but countless other professionals in the industry- and could put us out of work and how we make a living. This shouldn&#39;t be something allowed for studios, clients and ESPECIALLY the general public to do and get away with.
