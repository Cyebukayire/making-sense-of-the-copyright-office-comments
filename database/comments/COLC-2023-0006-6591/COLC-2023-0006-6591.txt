Were the technology under discussion actually &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; copyright might be a feasible factor for such creations, and would then be owned by the artificial being that created them; but what is today termed &quot;AI&quot; is in fact merely predictive modelling, which is not creation in any way; if it can be likened to anything it is mimicry, tracing, or even outright theft. There is not even anything &quot;transformative&quot; about the resulting &quot;works&quot; because for something to be transformative there must be an intentional intellect setting forth to create something new out of an existing work. That is not what our current &quot;AI&quot; does or is; none of the works created (more accurately: predicted and/or stolen) by today&#39;s &quot;AI&quot; programs merit copyright protections any more than the auto-fill option on your cellphone, because that is all that these predictive models are on a larger and more elaborate scale. Where there is no intellect, there can be no copyright for there is no creation; only the mimicry of someone else&#39;s extant work. Which again raises the spectre of AI works being intellectual and artistic theft... but even aside from that legal issue (which is admittedly no small thing) that means that there is no grounds for copyrighting such &quot;creations,&quot; as the rights to them belong to the creators of the original works which are being mimicked or &quot;trained from.&quot; Allowing someone to claim &quot;copyright&quot; over these AI &quot;creations&quot; would undermine the entire foundation of media creation in this country&mdash;and that&#39;s not even to think of the disaster that would result on a global scale, given how much copyright infringement we already deal with internationally. Please do not give in to the short-sighted greed of these corporate lords (who will also end up harmed in the end by such a policy, but are not farsighted enough to see the inevitable results) and instead protect intellectual property and the integrity of art, writing, and all other forms of human effort and creativity. Thank you.
