I have seen many AI covers done without the voice actor&rsquo;s permission. These People posting the covers on YouTube are using AI to steal their voices. I have reported such videos to YouTube that depict voices being stolen from many voice actors, including Erica Lindbeck, Matt Hill, Peter Kelamis, and the late Chester Bennington of Linkin Park. I have also seen tweets from people who don&rsquo;t approve of the idea of AI replacing voice actors, such as Brian Drummond, Kyle McCarley, and Stephanie Sheh. Three months ago when I attended A-Kon in Irving Texas, I had the pleasure of meeting Sword Art Online voice actress Cherami Leigh. She told the person right before me in line that she and many others no longer allow fans to request them to say lines on camera because of the growing concern. The fan conceded, as this is very justifiable. My hope is that President Biden is able to BAN the use of AI to steal voices in this manner and punish all who are caught with fines and possible prison time.
