Hi,<br/><br/>My name is Allen Chan. I&#39;m a professional voice actor. My line of work and lively hood is current being threatened by A.I. My voice and audio of my voice has been fed through multiple A.I voice acting softwares without my consent. Based on your own laws, ones voice is NOT in the public domain. Artists, writers, and actors will be phased out by A.I if nothing is done on a legistlative level.
