Hello!<br/><br/>AI works are not legitimate and shouldn&#39;t be treated as such. AI should be banned as source material for any creative work, such as visual media, audio, writing/scripts, choreography, etc.<br/><br/>Using any published or unpublished work to train an AI that the user does not personally have full copyright ownership of should be treated as identity theft. It is important to specify that even AI products that are not being marketed or sold should still be banned from &quot;data-scraping&quot; due to the ability of merely uploading something onto the internet counting at marketing when using AI. Parody law should not provide exceptions.<br/><br/>I will share some possible compromises that I have put thought into.<br/><br/>Any AI that would be used would have to publically declare any and all media used to train it, much like ingredients on food. Failure to do so should render a product illegal to sell. I am adding this stipulation because it would allow individual artists to train AI for their own personal use, using works they have created personally.<br/><br/>AI could also be &quot;single-use&quot;, meaning that once a work is created, the AI used to make it must be destroyed. This way, artists or companies may purchase the right to use a piece of media for AI training once. The amount paid for any media used must be proportional to above poverty cost-of-living for the artist. Single-use AI would not be allowed to use other AI generated works as source material, including previous iterations of itself.<br/><br/>One exception may be works in the creative commons licensing, but in that case, there should be a stipulation extending the amount of time since a work has been published and the ability to use it in AI. This is to prevent immediate descendants or otherwise invested individuals from suffering financially as a result of AI.<br/><br/>The USA is a media powerhouse and we need to treat that responsibility with respect. What we decide will be massively influential globally. Allowing companies or individuals to use AI as source material for creative works will massively compromise the integrity of American-made media that we might never recover from. Please consider the cultural impact. Please consider the economical impact; AI-use would put a significant portion of American citizens out of work and therefore reliant on government welfare.<br/><br/>To put it bluntly, use of artificial intelligence needs to be very strictly regulated.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
