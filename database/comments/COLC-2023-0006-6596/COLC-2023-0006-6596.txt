Large language learning models and AI corporations need to be bound by regulations that have serious enforcement mechanisms. As I writer, I do not and will not give permission to any AI and/or LLM to &quot;learn&quot; by using my work. The &quot;learning&quot; is, of course, simply plagiarizing. But many companies have already fed countless copyrighted works into their LLMs without any notification to or permission of request from the authors. Without realistic fear of significant penalties, these same companies will continue to vacuum up all written work without any compensation to the authors, and will consider any minimal fines as simply a cost of doing business. They cannot be trusted to police themselves, as they&#39;ve already stolen so much. Additionally, any &quot;work&quot; written by a computer or machine should not be copyrightable; by their nature, they have simply scanned and reused the work of others. It is plagiarism; it is theft. Bradley Paul, Los Angeles.
