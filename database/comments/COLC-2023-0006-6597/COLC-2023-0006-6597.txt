AI ruins everything, it will become self cannibalizing and that thing is, AI uses arts of others. And that is giving a hard time for artists to make a living, this discouranges artists and AI will cannibalize. And not just in visual arts, oh no. Writing, articles, every single type of medium of art will be self cannibalized by AI.<br/><br/>Every single time, artists have to go through this type of malicious things that target them. First it was NFTs and now this. Every single time there has been things that will kill the artist&#39;s soul to be driven to create. And do you want a stage of the internet to be a self cannibalizing,  and the thing is, it will look more inhumane. AI creates more mistakes than any beginner artist, it gives images/art 7 fingers, wrong proportions, and is racist and ableist. https://va.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_rz1apnAfYf1zb2zmi.mp4<br/><br/>That it just self cannibalization and is also not immune to human error. The video shows itself if you put a image of an autistic it always default to a white, young boy. Hardly giving someone older, someone that isn&#39;t a boy/man, and someone that isn&#39;t white.
