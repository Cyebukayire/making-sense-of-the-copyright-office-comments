AI Art programs are based on databases of the work of other artists, often taken without permission. Many artists I know and have seen have had their work taken without their permission, and entered into these learning databases to &quot;train&quot; it on their style of work. <br/><br/>Allowing these AI art pieces to be copyright is financially rewarding and protecting this theft- something copyright is supposed to protect artists from. Please ensure that AI artwork is NOT copyrightable under US law.
