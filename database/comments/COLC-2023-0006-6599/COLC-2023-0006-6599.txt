Works created by AI systems should not be copyrighted.  As the AI systems in their current state are not truly artificial intelligence, these works cannot be considered created by a person any more than one person who asks an artist to draw a sunflower can claim to be the creator of it simply because they had the idea.  As neither the prompter nor the AI can claim by definition that they created the work, it should not be copyrighted.  In addition, AI systems function as only an output of what is input. Instead of creation, what these AI bring into the world is regurgitative works.  No innovation of art can be formed, leaving us with a stagnation of art and culture should it be allowed to progress.
