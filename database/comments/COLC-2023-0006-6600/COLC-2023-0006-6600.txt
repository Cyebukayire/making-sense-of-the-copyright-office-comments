Hello! AI works rely on ripping art, voices, faces, writing and more from artists and amalgamating it into a shallow facsimile of human expression. AI generated works should never be copywriteable because the appropriation is impossible to credit and the artists have not been compensated or given permission for their original work to be used. I&#39;m a photographer, and the thought that there is someone behind a keyboard using keyword prompts to generate a &quot;wildlife photo&quot; from my work is abhorrent. <br/>Thank you for your time.
