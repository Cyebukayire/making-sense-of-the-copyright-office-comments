I am firmly against being able to copyright AI generated pieces as it&#39;s not creating the art, it&#39;s using applied statistics and being trained on stolen goods. In the sphere of fanworks (such as fanfiction or fanart), it&#39;s already difficult to get engagement and support with art theft and plagiarism running rampant. To me, this AI generated art and text is just a modern form of plagiarism, stealing the actual work from human artists.
