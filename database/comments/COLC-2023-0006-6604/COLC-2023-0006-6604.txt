I am offering comment as an individual and, frankly, a layman, though I do make art and post it online, so it is possible if not likely that my works are already being used in training AI models. It troubles me that I do not, and probably never will, know for sure whether my works are involved in training AI and whether anything has been produced using my work. Most of all, it troubles me that even if I did know this for sure, I likely wouldn&#39;t be able to do a thing about it. <br/><br/>1. With regards to copyright, I feel AI has the potential to take exposure and income away from less well-known artists or authors who might otherwise receive it, particularly were I to prompt an AI to generate an image in the style of one of these artists, then copyright and sell this design or merchandise using it.<br/><br/>4. As generative AI is a digital technology and sharing of AI-generated works is done primarily, if not almost exclusively, through the internet, it is critical for there to be international consistency in copyright law regarding AI works.<br/><br/>5. New legislation is absolutely warranted with regards to generative AI. It is imperative that there is legislation in place to protect human artists, authors, and anyone else whose lives and careers may be negatively affected by AI generated works, particularly in cases such as the example I gave in response to question 1.<br/><br/>6 and 7. While I do not have any examples ready, I have seen instances of AI-generated images in which the AI attempted to recreate a watermark, such as those found on stock images, indicating that some AI models are trained on copyrighted images. The AI often fails to successfully recreate a legible, accurate watermark that could be used to credit the copyright holder of the image. <br/><br/>8. In all fairness, an argument could be made that AI works are transformative enough to constitute fair use, though it would certainly follow that AI works cannot be used for commercial purposes; however, it is increasingly impossible to determine whether a work was created using AI. The most effective way to ensure that the fair use argument is not abused is to prevent the unauthorized use of copyrighted works in the training of AI models.<br/><br/>9. Given the volume of potential training material currently available on the internet that is tied to abandoned or lost accounts, it is critical that AI models receive affirmative/opt-in consent from copyright holders. If I find an attractive design on a paper blowing in the wind, this does not grant me the right to monetize it, even if the artist cannot be contacted. <br/><br/>9.2. If an &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; approach were adopted, how would that process work for a copyright owner who objected to the use of their works for training?  <br/>Should a copyright owner opt out of the use of their work for training, it would still be extremely difficult if not impossible to determine how many AI generated works were already created that were derivative of the copyright owner&#39;s work, and to appropriately compensate the copyright owner or otherwise correct the situation. In order to avoid such issues, an opt-in approach is necessary.<br/><br/>9.3. There is no reason not to get advance consent from copyright owners to use their materials in training. Inconvenience and lack of feasibility is not an excuse. Given the volume of works on the internet and the clear enthusiasm towards generative AI shown by much of the public, there will be no shortage of available works even if advance consent is required. If, for some reason, there are not enough works available with which to train AI models, this is simply a sign that there is not enough public support for their ethical use.<br/><br/>15. Developers of AI and training datasets should absolutely be required to collect, retain, and disclose records, with as much specificity as possible, indicating what materials are used to train their models, in order to provide some transparency to the models&#39; users and to the creators of said materials. This would also help rectify the issues in question 24 regarding the ability to prove that an AI generated image sufficiently copies an existing work to the point of requiring legal intervention.<br/><br/>28. Should the law require AI-generated material to be labeled or otherwise publicly identified as being generated by AI? If so, in what context should the requirement apply and how should it work?<br/>Much like the responsibility to disclose whether an individual or group received payment for a social media post, there should be a requirement to identify AI generated material in order to avoid misrepresenting one&#39;s ability or deceiving their audience.<br/><br/>28.1. Who should be responsible for identifying a work as AI-generated?<br/>Anyone who uses AI generated work in any capacity should be responsible for identifying it, and derivative works, as such. Many art sharing websites already require this, often due to popular demand and to avoid abuse.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this issue.
