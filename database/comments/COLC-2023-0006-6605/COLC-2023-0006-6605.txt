Nobody should ever have their work used for training by an AI if they don&#39;t agree to it. Right now, there&#39;s not enough oversight, and anything at all could end up in an AI&#39;s training data, much of that data being content the creator of did not permit to be used as training data. This is different from a human creator taking inspiration from another human&#39;s work, because humans put thought into every facet of their creations, creating something new for other humans. An AI is only trained to do what it is trained to do, it is motiveless. It is understandable that most people would not want to be reduced to data for an AI to train on, and their work should not be subjected to such a fate. <br/>AI creators need to be completely transparent about their training data, there shouldn&#39;t be anything they need to hide in there. Their data and results have to be vetted by humans, so it is not impossible. If they want to use human-made content for their training data to create AIs that can create infinite art, they should at least put in the work to vet and record it.<br/>Since a human that makes or prompts AI did not create the AI&#39;s output, and the AI cannot take reap reward or take responsibility for what it happens to output (such as harmful depictions and health hazards), and all AI is trained on data unethically sourced, the AI&#39;s output cannot functionally belong to anyone.
