I&#39;m scared that with AI it&#39;ll take all my hard work and people will claim it as their own. How come writers of the past were able to keep their copyright for almost a century, how can Disney keep it&#39;s own copy right of it&#39;s own characters when the original creator died almost a century ago, but we have to risk our content being stolen by people who simple just doesn&#39;t care? Please, please protect our content away from AI.
