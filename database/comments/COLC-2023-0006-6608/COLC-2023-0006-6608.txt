My husband and I are artists, and have at many separate times in our lives, made our livelihood off of our art&mdash;art is a passion, but for many like ourselves it&rsquo;s our job. AI simply is not making new, meaningful things&mdash;it simply takes from existing materials. It cannot functionally create something new. It only can steal what already exists and meaninglessly remix it. Remix culture is something I respect, study, and admire, and this is also not that situation. A remix is a purposeful, intentional, and meaningful choice by a human soul connecting with another human soul&rsquo;s work. This tool simply exists to erase the human connection entirely from art and make something to take money out of the hands of working artists. This is not to say that art is something to be gatekept&mdash;I truly believe that anybody can be an artist. But you have to put yourself out there and try. Not ask a computer to steal the words and works of others in an approximation of an aesthetic. Copyright exists to protect hard workers and their work. AI is stealing that work. It cannot and should not be defended.
