Whereas copyright is intended to defend the property rights of creators and all generative AI are trained on existing material, I would think that any content created by such AI would be in violation of copyright unless its training dataset was made exclusively of material either in the public domain or created specifically for the purpose of training that specific AI. And I would think only generative AI with that specific makeup of training material would be able to produce material even remotely eligible for copyright, but that even then the matter of authorship and ownership of that material would be dubious.
