AI is genuinely detrimental to the livelihoods of all individuals and corporations that make their living in the creative sphere, it harvests extreme amounts of copyrighted data from people who never consented and then the companies behind these AI ask to be paid fees as their AI uses copyrighted art to create collage images according to specific key words. Therefore, these companies are in fact making a profit off of using data they have have no permission or legal standing to use. Every AI generator is also heavily compromised with private medical data and illicit imagery of child abuse material that these companies refuse to purge themselves of because it would destroy the entire AI set as well. The damage that AIs will do to the economy and copyright without heavy regulation is incalculable.
