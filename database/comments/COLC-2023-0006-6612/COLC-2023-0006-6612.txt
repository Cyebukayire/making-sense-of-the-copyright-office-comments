A.I. and it&#39;s applications should never exceed niche internet humor. Officially licensing it&#39;s use to synthesize actors and their voices or try and replace writers is only going to rob many people of their livelihoods and ruin whatever media that uses it. I feel it is necessary to regulate it in order to protect actors&#39; and writers&#39; jobs as well as ensure we have quality content in our shows and movies. That&#39;s nothing compared to the possible illegal uses such as impersonation and defamation. I wish this technology had stayed obscure, but with how fast its popularity is soaring, it is clear that it needs to be controlled before it has a chance to do serious harm.
