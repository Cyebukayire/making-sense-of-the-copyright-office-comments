A.I. has become a widespread issue in this country. Besides people who work in the voice over industry having to fear someone replicating their voice without their consent, people outside of the industry also have to fear this due to scammers using A.I. to copy people&rsquo;s voices unsuspectingly and try to get money from their victims. <br/><br/>It&rsquo;s becoming an increasingly worrying situation and making things much more difficult for people to even be able to trust one another without knowing if someone actually said something or it was an Ai who said it.
