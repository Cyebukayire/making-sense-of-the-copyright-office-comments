AI has already affected my ability to receive commissions for my art since many of my clients have resorted to just using machines like Midjourney. Not only that, but they steal from artists. We are aware that no one owns an art style, but someone can create art that looks like I or another artist created it, and it&#39;s very easy for things to be made that I or another artist would never create, including highly inappropriate images. That could damage an artist&#39;s reputation. As well, without limits, AI will absolutely be used to replace artists, an already contentious industry to be in successfully. Art makes the world beautiful, and that has been done by human beings. We learn so much from ancient cultures just from the art they make, and to leave that in the hands of programs that have scraped the entire internet for art is inappropriate. Art is a skill anyone can learn with very rudimentary tools, and it takes years of passion and dedication to get to any level of skill. I graduated college right into the pandemic, and it was difficult enough to get an art job, let alone an art job during a time when everything was uncertain, people were dying and the jobs I invested that time and money for college weren&#39;t hiring.<br/><br/>AI Images (because they certainly aren&#39;t art but rather, replications of what others have done, Frankensteined into what should be a person, place or thing, but often misses the mark), should not be able to be copyrighted. Businesses should not be able to use stolen assets and profit from them while displacing hundreds of thousands of artists. And it isn&#39;t just visual art. It&#39;s music. It&#39;s animation. It&#39;s voice acting. There are millions of jobs on the line. People need to be protected from losing their livelihood just so greedy businesses can pump out mediocre art without properly paying artists for that work. If a monkey&#39;s selfie cannot be copyrighted, then neither can a program that stole millions of images from hardworking artists.
