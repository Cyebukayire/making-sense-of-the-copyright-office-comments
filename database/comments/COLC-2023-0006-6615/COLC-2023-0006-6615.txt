I come here as creator of both narrative an illustration, and as a librarian.<br/>It is vital that regulations be enacted upon AI. The way they currently operate is blatant theft of creative and academic works. <br/>To use visual art as an example: they scrape images off the internet without consent of any of the artists who&#39;s works are taken and used to generate images. The makers of AI then claim these to be original works, when it is created from an amalgam of others, again, taken without right or consent.<br/>Not only is AI theft of the artist&#39;s work, it is also used in the theft of artists jobs. Companies will use AI to generate images in lieu of hiring an artist to make them. Companies are paying to instead steal the works of hundreds of artists at a time to make a single image. <br/>But this is not just the case with visual art pieces; similar cases of theft exist for animation, actors likenesses, and even recordings of voice actors is ongoing.<br/>On top of these issues with both visual and audio media, the same is happening in writing. Not just in creative writing, but in texts in general. Text on the internet, texts submitted in work, in college, even high school level. Teachers are having to specifically state, that if students use AI writing they will be flunked, because an AI generated work is in of itself, a plagerized work. We already are in an age of serious misinformation issues, and AI generated media is making it 100 times worse. It needs clear laws and regulation, and it needs it now.<br/>If this tool is to be used at all, it can only be with consent of those who works are being used, or else limited to public commons works.<br/>The tool should also be called what it is: machine generated, as no learning is occurring on the part of the program.<br/>
