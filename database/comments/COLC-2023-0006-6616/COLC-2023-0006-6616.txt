Strict regulations need to be set in place for anything to do with AI, especially in the arts. AI has already begun to completely rob the human aspect of the arts, in favor of pumping out synthetic garbage for cheaper prices. Not only that, AI technologies are actively stealing others&rsquo; works in various ways and reaping all the benefits. I think some of the most heinous uses of AI can be seen in the entertainment industry. Countless peoples&rsquo; voices have been stolen and repurposed into synthetic voices, allowing others to use their voices in any way they see fit. If that isn&rsquo;t a blatant violation of simple human rights, then I don&rsquo;t know what is. AI is committing massive art theft, pure and simple. Something NEEDS to be done, otherwise the basic human expression and creativity found in art is going to be completely lost.
