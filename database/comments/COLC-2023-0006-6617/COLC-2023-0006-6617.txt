What is the purpose of image generating AI? <br/>To give the layperson the ability to generate countless images without formal training, knowledge or practice - while profiting industries developing these softwares.<br/><br/>How does generative AI produce images?<br/>Training based on images often created by people who spent years of their lives in formal training, practicing and who have decades or more experience.<br/><br/>It is ludicrous that publicly available imagery, scraped by non-profit scientific groups that package them as data sets like LAION-5B - can be consumed by for profit companies (Like Midjourney) who create software that puts artists out of work, using their own work. These are artists are told they can remove their training data for the next datasets by using systems that would require they spend many, many, many hours hunting down their own work which, depending on their popularity, may result in one image alone having potentially hundreds or even thousands of duplicates in a training set. This isn&#39;t tenable and it should not be the artist&#39;s obligation to carry this out.<br/><br/>The copyright office rightfully identified that AI created imagery can&#39;t be copywritten at this stage, but this won&#39;t stop AI imagery permeating the entire online experience and won&#39;t stop the issues raised above. <br/><br/>What is my point? The copyright office is a bulwark against large corporations that will want to avoid the litigious minefield that might arise from utilizing generative artwork. Corporation&#39;s positions are not taken out of concern for artists nor are they concerned for the morality of its use. The copyright office&#39;s position will dictate whether this behavior continues or not. If it is swayed by the opportunistic, amoral lobbying of the AI industry - we could see a future where the benefits or motivation for human creative work diminishes to such a degree that it becomes irrelevant.<br/><br/>It is up to the titans of industry and government to decide the fate of human directed creative fields, as unfortunately the lowly artists who found themselves in a very fortunate and brief period of time where they could make a living off their work may find themselves returning to a historical norm where their passion can no longer sustain them. They lack the influence and power to sway larger decision making and policy. Money talks and there currently isn&#39;t a single cohesive creative organized voice with a collective financial backing that can compete with industry. <br/><br/>Institutions like the copyright office are their voice, for now.<br/><br/>
