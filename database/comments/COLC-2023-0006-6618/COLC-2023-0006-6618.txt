Permission by and/or compensation for copyright owners should be required when their works are included, at any and all stages of AI model training and when used as a &#39;prompt&#39; for an AI model to work off of. An AI model cannot make decisions as to its training data - the developers of the model do so, and should be responsible. Records should be mandatory and publicly available for every stage of model training. If a work is &quot;good enough&quot; to be fed into the model&#39;s training data, then the person responsible for creating the original work should be credited publicly and compensated for their work.<br/><br/>AI-generated works should be ineligible for copyright in any and all cases, as no human was involved in the actual creation of the work. &quot;Training&quot; and &quot;prompting&quot; a generative AI system, regardless of the amount of control, is in no way the creation of an actual work. <br/><br/>Liability should be shared between the developers and users; the developers for not providing enough training material and the user for not taking steps to ensure the generated work was fair use or substantively different. <br/><br/>I am a digital illustrator. My hours of work and years of training and skill development are in no way comparable to an image generated by an AI, and if my work were to be used in training data or as a &quot;prompt&quot; without permission and credit, I would consider it a copyright issue.
