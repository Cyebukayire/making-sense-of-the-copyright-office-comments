&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a marketing term, Turing machines are not capable of producing the phenomenon of consciousness that people posses. These are just very complicated computer programs. The output of these programs are mathematically determined, the result of a fixed set of procedures. It&#39;s true that these procedures are extremely complicated and have many layers to them, making them seem at first glance to be something more than just programs. But that is all they are. Programs. The copyright office has a long history of defining copywrite as the result of HUMAN will and effort. To change that now, just because the computer programs have gotten very complicated, would be a foolishness that would be marked in history. Allow the output of &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; to be copywriteable, and you will be calling into question the very legal notion of intelectual property. You would be undermining the legitimacy of your own institution.<br/><br/>...which would actually be very cool. So do that. Push over the first domino that ends this archaic system once and for all. Let people who own AI do a copywrite on it&#39;s silly output.
