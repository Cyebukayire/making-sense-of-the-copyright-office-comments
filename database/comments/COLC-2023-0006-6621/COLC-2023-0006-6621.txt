What Silicon Valley is calling &quot;AI&quot; is built on the copyrighted works of others that just cuts and pastes parts of those works into something claiming it as new. It is wholly inaccurate at even basic fact checking, and incapable of matching the work done by humans that it&#39;s trained on. The point of the copyright system is to protect original works of actual artists from being exploited, while &quot;AI&quot; is built entirely on exploiting actual creativity. To grant artificially created works copyright status will basically undermine the entire copyright system. Not to mention that granting copyright status to &quot;AI&quot; generations will only be used to exploit actual creators by stealing their work and then never paying them when a program uses it to make something for free. If &quot;AI&quot; is granted copyright status, then we may as well not have a copyright system in place anymore because it means nothing when you can steal other people&#39;s copyrighted works and claim it as your own.
