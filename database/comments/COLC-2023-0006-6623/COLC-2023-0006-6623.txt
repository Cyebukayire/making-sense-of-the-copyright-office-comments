I agree with the following opinion from the case &#39;Naruto v. David Slater et al.&#39;:<br/><br/>&quot;We must determine whether a monkey may sue humans,corporations, and companies for damages and injunctive relief arising from claims of copyright infringement. Our court&rsquo;s precedent requires us to conclude that the monkey&rsquo;s claim has standing under Article IIIof the United States Constitution.Nonetheless,we conclude that this monkey&mdash;and all animals, since they are not human&mdash;lacks statutory standing under the Copyright Act. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.&quot;<br/><br/>Generative AI is not a human any more than a macaque monkey is; therefore, any media generated by generative AI cannot be enforced under current Copyright law.<br/><br/>It is my personal opinion that Generative AI content should immediately fall into public domain. If content is knowingly used in the making of a larger piece of media (movie, video game, audio track etc.) then that content should also fall into public domain by default. This will ensure that there is no profit motive to utilize content from generative AI (which is intentionally trained on skilled artists of all mediums) and ensure that human authorship of creative endeavors is the clear route that a for-profit creative venture would have to take.
