Hello, I am an author based in Texas with various concern regarding unregulated AI because of threats to copyright and livelihoods. This technology is already doing damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little to no recourse.<br/><br/>Instances of AI users taking advantage of the fact that many artists, authors, actors, models, etc. need to use the internet to market their work. They take the posts to put the person&rsquo;s content into a machine and then trying to sell these pieces off as the user&rsquo;s original work, when nothing is original about it. Imagine you made various cookies for a bake sale and another vendor comes to your table, steals your cookies, and then puts the pilfered sweets on a platter on their table and passes them off as their own cookies. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening in real life.<br/><br/>Worse is now we&rsquo;ve seen instances of people trying to sell foraging guides to make money on Amazon made with AI even going as far as to make-up fake authors with fake credentials. These foraging guides will tout that various inedible flora is wholly edible which will lead to illness, at best, and death, in a worse case scenario. <br/><br/>Regulations are a necessity with this technology as copyright holders and working artists need to know their creations can be protected and, given the above paragraph, will save many people from hospital visits or wrongful death due to someone taking advantage of a lack of regulations to make money.   This will not hinder any innovation, it will support it. The current unregulated generative model hurts hard workers in the field of art and entertainment and will soon hurt the average citizen. <br/>
