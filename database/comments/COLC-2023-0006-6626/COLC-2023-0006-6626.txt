Dear US Copyright Office, <br/><br/>Thank you for allowing the public to comment on the matter of generative AI and copyright. I am a published literary author, journalist and researcher, publisher, and a communications and marketing professional. I also own a small business which produces original content for clients. This means I have worn numerous hats throughout my career, and have had experience with and insight into the creation and usage of various types of content, from photography, art, and graphic design to audiovisual media to text.<br/><br/>On behalf of my firm, we fully agree with and support your AI Registration Guidance, which has &quot;reiterated the principle that copyright protection in the United States requires human authorship.&quot; In our professional opinion, no work, be it audiovisual, graphic, design, text-based, music, or other media or formats, should be protected with copyright if it was created in whole or in part by algorithms or computer code, such as Large Language Models, Generative Pre-trained Transformers, or other forms of artificial intelligence or computer systems. In other words, if a non human entity or process is directed by either a human or another computer to create a work, that work should not be granted copyright, and the human individual (or corporate entity) who guided the creation of said work should never be considered the copyright holder. More specifically still, if the non human entity or process (for example an AI system) employed in the creation of said works, had been trained on human-produced works without proper notification, consent, credit, or compensation, it should be deemed that any outputs are at least partially or indirectly plagiarized and therefore do not qualify to be considered &quot;original works&quot; in any sense of the word.<br/><br/>Granting copyright to AI- or machine-generated works would not only grossly devalue and invalidate the talent, creativity, ingenuity, and effort of millions of human individual creators around the world, it would effectively put into question the right to their own works, and diminish their potential to earn a living using their own skills. This would in turn destabilize the U.S. economy and likely the economies of other nations as well. <br/><br/>We urge the U.S. Copyright Office to stand firmly in support of the millions of creators and entrepreneurs in the United States, and protect their right to own their own original works and protect the concept, practice, and legal status of human authorship.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>
