I would caution against extending copyright to any AI generated materials. It&#39;s also in the name. &quot;Machine Learning.&quot; These types of so-called artificial intelligence do not include true understanding of their output. Especially problematic is the issue that many machine learning datasets are often trained with stolen data in the first place. I think that the copyright office should take a very narrow and restrictive view when it comes to granting copyright to any works generated with &quot;AI-assistance&quot; in conjunction with a human being as well.
