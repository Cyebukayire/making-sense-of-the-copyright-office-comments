As an author and a small entrepreneur who relies on written content for a living, LLMs and generative content are sources of great concern for me. I worry that these technologies could obliterate the competitive landscape, allowing larger players to flood the market with massive volumes of content, thereby drowning out smaller businesses.<br/><br/>Additionally, I have several concerns regarding generative AI which I will clumsily outline here.<br/><br/>Advocates of generative AI claim that it will usher in a golden age of knowledge. In truth, it will simply enable human laziness. Why create something original when a simple prompt can scour the internet and rehash ideas that have already been expressed in slightly different ways? While the transformative potential of these &quot;altered ideas&quot; may inspire and educate initially, there is a genuine risk that we could quickly find ourselves trapped in an unending cycle of recycled ideas, with few original ideas being created. This technology could potentially yield the contrary outcome, wherein instead of ushering in a golden age of knowledge, it might accelerate a period of innovation stagnation, keeping us rooted in today&#39;s ideas, convictions, and knowledge.<br/><br/>Generative AI will affect how our youth will think. Children growing up with this technology will mistake a clever prompt for an original thought. They might become curators of regurgitated knowledge, failing to contribute anything truly novel. What&#39;s more, they will lose their ability to wrestle with complex ideas when a computer can hand then &lsquo;an idea&rsquo;, if not the &lsquo;best idea&rsquo;. <br/><br/>At first glance, these two concerns may appear similar, but in the first case, it pertains to existing creators becoming complacent, which is worrisome in its own right. The latter concern, however, speaks to the complete inhibition of future original ideas. I suspect that the top 1% of innovators will continue to strive for originality, but how will their groundbreaking ideas reach us if we are inundated with recycled concepts presented as new? Their voices could get lost in the vast sea of existing ideas, and our species might become trapped in the limitations of today&#39;s knowledge.<br/><br/>What can we do about it?<br/><br/>We often hear that the genie is out of the bottle, a phrase I dislike because it suggests a sense of helplessness, as if there&#39;s little we can do. However, in the original stories about genies &ndash; or jinn &ndash; our hero invariably manages to reseal the genie before it causes irreparable harm.<br/><br/>So, how can we metaphorically reseal this genie? <br/><br/>Firstly, anything that is less than 70% human-created should not be eligible for copyright protection. Secondly, it should be publicly disclosed whether a piece of content is AI-generated or not. Those developing generative AI must implement visible watermarks on all art to easily distinguish between AI-created and human-created content.<br/><br/>For written language, a universally accessible library should be established to catalog all outputs from LLMs. As for art, watermarks and a searchable database can help identify all art generated through AI.<br/><br/>If creators of LLMs and generative AI cannot adhere to these technological capabilities, they should refrain from making their technology accessible until they can. After all, if their AI systems are all they claim it to be, then with said technologies, they should expedite the process of finding a solution, should they not?<br/>
