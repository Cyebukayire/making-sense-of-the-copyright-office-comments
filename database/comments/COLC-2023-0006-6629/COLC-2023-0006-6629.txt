I am sending this comment because I believe that AI is far too unethical to use in this regard. People work hard to develop the skills and techniques they use for their artistic endeavors, and letting others steal and reuse those efforts with AI would go against moral sense. These forms of AI should be banned from commercial use and face restrictions to protect and respect artists.
