<br/>Ai is a threat to existing works of artists, writers, designers and many other necessary jobs because it uses randomly sourced images without permission. It must be regulated heavily in order to avoid impersonation, copyright infringements, and the decaying of quality in things that nurture us, such as movies, art, books, and media. AI will mindlessly blend these things into amalgamate monstrosities that if not regulated, will also saturate the creative world with imitations and kitsch generated by computer algorithms.
