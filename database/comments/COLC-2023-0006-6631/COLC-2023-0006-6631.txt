As both a writer and consumer of all sorts of media and copyright enthusiast, I feel very strongly that AI generated content should not be eligible for copyright. Leaving aside creative intent and purpose of art for a moment, it sets a dangerous precedent for the artists who make a living at this. Almost every use of AI generated content I have seen has been to get around paying artists, an already competitive and underpaid field.
