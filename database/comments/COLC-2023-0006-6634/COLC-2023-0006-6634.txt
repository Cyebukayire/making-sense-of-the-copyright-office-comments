Hello, I would like to state as an artist that I believe AI works shouldn&#39;t be able to be copyrighted as there was no human involved in the making of the work (whether that be writing, &#39;drawing&#39;, etc.). Telling an AI to generate an image is not equal to spending time and effort developing skills to create a piece of art nor does it involve anything more abstract such as an intent to evoke an emotion, which is the intention of artworks. Thank you.
