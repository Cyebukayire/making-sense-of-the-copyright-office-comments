AI has already proven to be destructive to many creative fields like art and writing. More worrying is the generation and sale of plant guidebooks. These books are full of dangerous misinformation that WILL get people killed. Nowhere do they disclose that they were generated by AI for a quick buck. The most concerning thing I&rsquo;ve seen is the ability to recreate a person&rsquo;s voice and/or likeness using AI and a very short sample. Surely this poses a threat to security? I shudder to think about what else I could be horrified by if I were paying closer attention. Regulations NEED to be put in place, and quickly.
