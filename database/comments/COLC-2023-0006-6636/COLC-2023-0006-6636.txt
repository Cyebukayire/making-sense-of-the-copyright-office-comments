I&#39;m a small time artist who now fears posting my work publicly because of AI training bots taking my work. I&#39;ve lost my audience and livelihood and I feel like I&#39;ve lost my humanity. This was something precious to me that made me feel human and let me connect with people. Now it&#39;s just something considered so worthless that it&#39;s just taken away with no credit or even acknowledgement that a human being was behind this thing that&#39;s been made without my consent and gets paid more for stealing work that takes me hours to create. AI work is stolen property at its heart, it devalues all the care and decades of hard work real human artists put into our creations, it is not alive or feeling or caring, it does not deserve the right to legitimacy that is already barely afforded to living people who pour their lives into work that is now being stolen from them. I have so little to live for as it is, stop taking the last shreds of what makes life good away from us.
