There&#39;s a larger argument that copyright in general&#39;s being used for private greed and malice by trolls.  Under normal conditions, that would be perjury, but private companies aren&#39;t enforcing that part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, either.<br/>Knowing how intellectual property is to minds what zoning is for roads, I&#39;d rather see the whole of copyright and intellectual property abolished.
