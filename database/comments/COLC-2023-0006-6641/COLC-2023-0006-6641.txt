As someone who works for a tech company experimenting with various new AI technologies, I want to provide this observation.<br/><br/>When we create a large language model model trained on various subject matter experts&#39;s knowledge, the experts are aware that their work is going to be used. They are also getting compensated fairly for their services rendered. <br/><br/>Adobe trains their models on Adobe Stock, along with openly licensed work and public domain content where copyright has expired. This policy ensures that no copyright can be infringed.<br/><br/>Not many others are as transparent. To avoid the work being used without the permission of the original creator, there needs to be some protection present before the AI generated art can be copyrighted. Unless all artists posting their work online is made aware of a &quot;Do Not Train&rdquo; Consent form that allows them to retain ownership of their piece, i don&#39;t think any dataset nor AI generated art can be copyrighted.
