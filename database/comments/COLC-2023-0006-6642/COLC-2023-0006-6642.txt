I think that generative AI has a massive negative effect on creatives and our copyright. The fact that the data it is trained on is unregulated, other people&#39;s copyrighted work and in some cases private data, is an obvious reason - the purpose of copyright is to protect our work from being used in this way. Unlike satirical or parody works, they do not contain an intentional element of transformation - prompts may be used, but the actual end product is only made from scraps of other people&#39;s copyrighted work - most of which the prompter is not conscious of, other than when they input specific artists names, or the names of real people in order to create their likeness.<br/><br/>The fact that specific artists&#39; styles can be mimicked, and sold for profit is also a breach of their copyright - many working professionals are finding mimicries of their work made be image generators. This not only is replacing what would have potentially been a job they were hired for, but also creating a worse mockery of their work - not in order to make any commentary or conversation, but purely to profit off of someone else&#39;s brand and copyright.<br/><br/>The outputs are not benefiting artists or culture - they are often sub-par, for quick consumption and profit, and do not contain human consideration of nuance. <br/>It takes the human imagination and creativity out of &#39;created&#39; art, and what is the point of that? Progress does not happen with regurgitated data into worse images and stories; it happens with human choices, passion, practice, and work. Surely the point of automation is that people spend less time on taxing and unrewarding jobs, and more time to think, imagine and create? This generated content is the antithesis of this.
