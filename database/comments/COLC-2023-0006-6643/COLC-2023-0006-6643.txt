As a trained artist and graphic designer, I would like to make the point that AI training takes on much the same form as Human student learning. AI does not store copyrighted material. Instead, it studies it and learns what is the elements and &quot;essence&quot; of creative writing, language or art, and then whittles that down into a set of guides and principles it can apply to create it&#39;s own good content. If you outlaw this, you must also outlaw human learning. Because we too train on the work of better authors, artists, writers, and learn the principles required to improve our own skills. This is not plagiarism, this is how we learn.
