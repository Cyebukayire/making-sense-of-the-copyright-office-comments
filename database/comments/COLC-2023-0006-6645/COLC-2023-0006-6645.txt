AI is definitely a tricky beast. I am one who has tried to remain neutral on the situation, though it&#39;s become very clear that this has become a far bigger issue than simply creating images, sounds, even films or articles without direct human influence<br/>In light of this, I feel it would be strongly beneficial if AI were regulated similar to Vocaloid or UTAUloid voice banks. Certain models can be purchased, or created for one&#39;s own use, that models made WITHOUT an individual artist&#39;s permission are illegal (or at the very least frowned upon), that large companies cannot use them in direct creation of their products.<br/>As an illustrator myself, I find AI helpful in regards to combating art block, and I feel this shouldn&#39;t be an issue for individual artists. But again, this comes with the risk of detriment to the livelihood of artists that make art for a living.  Or, for example, an individual who wants to commission a piece of a character of theirs but doesn&#39;t have a reference sheet.  AI can help bring that individual character to life, and the artist doesn&#39;t solely have to rely on a written description.<br/><br/>It boils down to how, who, and why AI is used.<br/>If it&#39;s to influence/advance the creation of a work directly, such as a film, it should be illegal.  If it&#39;s an individual simply looking for a means to combat art block or get an idea for a piece, then it&#39;s fine.<br/>But again, LoRa and other such tools used in AI simply need to be more regulated akin to the voice banks used in UTAU and Vocaloid.
