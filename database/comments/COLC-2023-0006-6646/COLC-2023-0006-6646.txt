Whilst AI created material may pass the current laws for copyright because the content generated from a user prompt may not be 100% the same as another piece of copyright material, the copyright laws must be updated for this onset of advanced technology.<br/><br/>The artists and authors that the AI technology was trained on gave no consent for their art and material to be used to train the AI model and now AI technology such as Midjourney and Dall-E create images with human artist signatures in the bottom, clearly proving to even the ordinary layman that these technologies are profiting off of splicing together other artist&rsquo;s material without consent or any payment towards the original artist.<br/><br/>Some claim that this isn&rsquo;t too dissimilar to how art worked already as human artists become inspired by artists they admire and create similar material. However, in order to create material that  had over 90% similarity with another artist&rsquo;s style, it would have taken many years of dedicated practice and by that point such an artist would often times take in other influences over the years and profit more by creating in their own style as it is more unique. For this reason, human copying hasn&rsquo;t ever been as much of a threat to the livelihood of the original artist.<br/><br/>However, with this technology, an AI tool can generate hundreds of copies of another artist&rsquo;s style within minutes at a much cheaper cost to the business wanting to use the material without having to practice for years or decades and developing its own style. This does directly effect the livelihood of the original artist.<br/><br/>So we have a situation in which artists have not been asked consent for their art to be used in these AI collage tools and their art can be re-created at low costs simply by typing &ldquo;in the style of ____&rdquo; and including the name of the original artist as a prompt.<br/><br/>Previously the copyright laws did not include reference to style because in the context of human created art it was hard to define.<br/>However with AI, the consequences are much more severe and there are clear objective ways to create the laws. If typing &ldquo;draw me a painting of a flower in the style of&rdquo; and including the name of a living artist is made illegal, then artists can retain their livelihoods and income as they can make a living off of the style they spend decades crafting. <br/>Copyrighting style with human artists is difficult because theres subjectivity in what inspired the art and how much affinity there is between the &ldquo;styles&rdquo; of the two pieces of art. However, with AI tools, there is objectivity in which prompts were used. For example, did the prompt indicate that the user of the tool had the direct intent to steal the style of another artist? Its a much easier question to answer. If the prompt included the name of another living artist, the answer is yes because their name is being used to guide the AI tool to make something similar to that artists body of work without working for it or asking permission to use that artists body of work.<br/><br/>The benefits of this technology are that art, both visual and written, is cheaper for businesses to generate at low cost.<br/>The negative consequences are much more impactful. Businesses will flood the internet with content because its so easy to do so with minimal effort and at mass scale. This means consumers of the internet won&rsquo;t be able to trust what they&rsquo;re seeing or hearing. <br/>Furthermore, as explained, artists will have businesses making money off of their style that took years or decades to create without paying the original artist a penny.<br/><br/>It must be recognized that the copyright of style is distinctly different between human made art and AI made art. A human artist has never and will never be able to simply say &ldquo;write a novel in the style of J.K Rowling&rdquo; and have a book automatically written in seconds where as a user of AI can. Whilst doing this exact feat may not be possible now, it is most certainly where the technology is heading. A human would have had to practice for thousands of hours to achieve a written style that so closely resembles another&rsquo;s and in dedication to a craft for thousands of hours, in most cases, such an artist would take in other influences and develop their own style. Human made art and AI art are clearly different. AI art also has the clear evidence of a prompt that can be used to objectively see wether stealing another artist&rsquo;s style was the user&rsquo;s intent. Human art and AI art must be recognized as separate processes by copyright law.<br/><br/>Copyright laws must be updated to include an artist&rsquo;s style in the context of AI and prompt based technology because when it comes to written prompts, intent to steal is so clear and objective that laws can be written around them. Not doing so leads to a host of negative consequences that far outweigh the positive consequences of leaving the laws as they are now.
