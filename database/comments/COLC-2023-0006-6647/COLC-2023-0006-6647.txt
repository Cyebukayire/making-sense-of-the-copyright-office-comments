Speaking as a freelance artist, the current renditions of generative AI are designed to directly compete with and ultimately replace people in all sectors of creative work.<br/><br/>While generative AI could potentially be beneficial to everyone, the current dynamic of unsolicited scraping and training sets up a dangerous precedent where the majority of the benefits of creative labor are redirected away from the original creators towards the pockets of technology companies.  Without a robust response, this process will result in an environment where the already poorly compensated creative sector will be robbed of the fruits of their labor while it is consolidated to the owners of the generative AI models.<br/><br/>People should not have to be concerned that the work they produce will be entirely exploited by an outside party without any form of permission, recognition, or compensation.  It is especially egregious when large companies stand to make billions off of this exploited labor, enriching themselves at the expense of the masses.
