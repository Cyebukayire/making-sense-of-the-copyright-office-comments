While I believe that generative AI is an amazing technology with great potential for human creativity, I also firmly believe that visual artist should be protected from scraping, theft and brazen profiteering of their craft and work.<br/>An unregulated genAI landscape will become a nightmare for the creative field, that especially in industries such as cinema, animation and games is already predatory and self-referential.<br/>Many artist and activists have eloquently spoken out about the dangers genAI poses and I believe we as a nation and as a world would benefit from protecting our creatives.<br/><br/>Yes AI is a tool, but any tool must be used responsibly. Legislators have a responsability to care for their electorate and fellow citizens. While it might not be as tangible as raw natural resources or firepower, art is fundamental to humanity and should be cared for.
