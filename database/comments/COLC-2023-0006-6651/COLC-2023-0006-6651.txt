At this point, AI generated media has no place within the copyright system. It is all created as a derivative work from an original, no matter how different it may seem from the source material. It is very much akin to &quot;sampling&quot; in music; another work was created using elements stolen from an existing work, potentially damaging the original artist financially. Without assistance from human hands, the work has no merit. If an AI generated work was taken and altered to reasonable degree by a human (i.e. correcting imperfections, small details; using the work as a base to build a large work on), then I would say it now has an intent. Once the work has been deemed &quot;good enough&quot; to alter, once it is altered, that means that someone found enough value in what it represents to merit putting more into it. At that point, I would say it now has creative merit and should be allowed to hold copyright.
