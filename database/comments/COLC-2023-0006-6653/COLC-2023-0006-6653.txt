Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment. I am both an artist and supporter of artists, &amp; recognize how important it is to support the artistic fields in a democratic society, as well as for artists to be able to monetize their creations. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is unconstitutional. The authors should have explicitly given consent to do so (which you may find that many will not), otherwise it is a violation of the author&#39;s rights to control their work. The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training. Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>
