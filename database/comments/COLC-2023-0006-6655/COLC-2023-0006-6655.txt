Firstly, thank you for opening up this question to public comment. I am an employee at a company currently transitioning a voice assistant AI to an LLM stack, and I am very concerned with the ethical and legal questions raised by generative AI models in general.<br/><br/>While there are doubtlessly positive and constructive applications of model-generated text and artwork, and the models themselves are revolutionary in their scope and application, there remain legal concerns around how training data for these models is sourced, and how the output of these models is utilized.<br/><br/>It is my understanding that many of the current publicly recognizable LLM and text-to-image models, including OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT as well as Stable Diffusion, are trained on unethically sourced data and images, including those that have been scraped off of websites in express violation of their terms of service. This is not only a legal violation as I understand it of those sites&#39; terms of services, but of the copyrights held by the original creators of the works. Data sets should be composed only of those works whose creators have consented to such a use, and mechanisms should be implemented to hold data set creators and managers to account and to verify all elements of a data set are legally and ethically sourced.<br/><br/>Additionally, some measure of disclosure should be implemented on the output of these models to inform an audience that the image or text is model-generated. There also should be guardrails implemented around copyrighting and monetization of any output of a model. It is my understanding that human-transformative works such as fanfiction are not legally copyrightable or monetizable even as they differ from an original creator&#39;s work, as they draw on the core elements of the original creator&#39;s work, and so too should machine-transformative works be held to the same account.<br/><br/>Until the data sets for these models are verifiably legally and ethical, and the use of model output is regulated, these models will be doing more harm than good to the creative communities of the United States.
