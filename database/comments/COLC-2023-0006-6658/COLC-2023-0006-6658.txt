Items created using artificial intelligence (AI), such as books, music, art, photography, etc., should not be eligible for copyright. In addition, copyright work should not be permitted to be used to train AI systems, unless the person who holds the copyright gives their consent in writing.<br/><br/>Artists and writers are already suffering enough because of piracy. Now we are battling floods of AI art and books hitting the internet and markets. People are loading specific artwork into AI, which makes only minor alterations, then calling it their own. Similarly, people are loading unfinished series (that are copyrighted) into AI to &quot;find out&quot; what will happen next and publishing them. Stronger rules need to be put in place to ensure human creatives are not pushed to the side lines by people looking to steal copyrighted work and calling it their own, especially when their intensions are to sell the AI generated product.<br/><br/>Additionally, AI generated work is becoming misleading. I have seen where people actually believe images created by AI to be real. I also have seen first hand people purchasing and using AI generated work from stock art sites. If nothing else, there needs to be regulations where AI generated material must be marked with an obvious identifier (a watermark or brand) that it is AI generated, and the product should be prohibited from being sold on any market.<br/><br/>Please continue to support human creatives.
