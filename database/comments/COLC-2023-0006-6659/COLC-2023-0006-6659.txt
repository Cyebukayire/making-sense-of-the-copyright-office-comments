I am an artist and a student going into animation. My dream is to one day break into the animation industry. The onset of AI is, in a word, terrifying. It&#39;s being used in all the wrong, unethical ways and so far nothing has been done to regulate it. Especially with Marvel using AI to make the intro sequence for their new show Secret Invasion, they&#39;re setting a dangerous precedent that I only hope isn&#39;t followed. Art is part of what makes us human-- the most a robot can do is copy us, not create something of it&#39;s own. AI generated media should not be abke to gain copyright protection. AI should not be trained off of media stolen without the original artists&#39; consent. AI should not be used to take the place of trained artists who have spent years mastering their craft. This is not what it was meant for. All I want is a career to look forward to.
