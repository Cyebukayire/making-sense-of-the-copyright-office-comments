As a self-published author I believe very strongly that AI works should not be able to be copyrighted. There is no human creator whose rights are being protected, no human labor being rewarded. Current AI utilizes work from writers without their permission (which should already be a violation of copyright), and can create so much output so quickly that it threatens the livelihoods of actual creatives by flooding the marketplace with soulless patchworks. If the intention of copyright as concept exists to protect a citizen&#39;s ability to profit from their intellectual property and labor during their lifetime, AI generated works stand in opposition to that, especially in their current form, and do not deserve protection under the law. Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>(I can&#39;t even submit this form without confirming I&#39;m NOT a robot, which I&#39;d like to think makes the point even clearer!! :) )
