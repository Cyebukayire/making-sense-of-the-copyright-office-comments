As a struggling artist, I can tell you that AI has been nothing but a problem for me for the past couple years. First I had to stop posting on DeviantArt because they started opting people in for AI scraping without their consent, meaning I had to manually go and un-opt my hundreds of works on the site dating back to my middle school years. Next I had to outright delete my art Twitter because the platform began scraping everyone&#39;s content without any consent. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve gotten a commission from anyone outside my close artistic friend group in years, in no small part because a not-insignificant number of would-be customers are using AI to generate art without having to pay any of the artists for the works they had copied and used to train the AI. I&#39;ve seen quite a few people hiding their work behind layers of complicated and distracting watermarks in a desperate attempt to preserve their work, or even just quitting art altogether. I used to post works in progress all the time, but now that an AI user can take an unfinished piece, have an AI &quot;finish&quot; it, and then demand the original artist pay them for the copyright because the finished product was theirs, I don&#39;t dare update people on my progress anymore.<br/>I think AI should require permission from the artists whose work is being used to train their algorithms. It&#39;s clear that there&#39;s a major accountability problem among that community, and it will only get worse if left to their own devices. I, for one, do not want to see the independent art community have to go underground because some tech junkies don&#39;t respect the intellectual property of actual creators.<br/>Beyond that, I&#39;ve noticed a few other disturbing trends in relation to AI and the arts. Apparently, studios are looking to scan and copyright people&#39;s actual faces for use in film, without their permission and without compensation. One would think your own face is your own intellectual property, but I guess not! I find that abysmal. Additionally, it seems that in their efforts to cripple American culture for the purposes of profits, they&#39;re looking to replace writers and actors with AI by taking their work and scraping it to train algorithms. I think it&#39;s downright criminal that people can take the copyright of someone&#39;s work, depriving them of income, just by using a technological loophole. I think that loophole needs to be closed, if this country is to have any contributions to the entertainment industry in the near future.
