It makes no sense whatsoever to have a copyright provided to someone who did no work, consulted with no engineer, and essentially just rolled some dice hoping that what they&#39;d make would be random enough, to be usable. This is, of course, to say nothing of what the AI would by necessity be trained on: other copyrights or patents. Unless the machine is trained on media made prior to 1920, which would be highly difficult to acquire, it by necessity engages in copyright infringement by using it for commercial gain. There is so little public domain for AI to work with, I have no idea how an AI could work without infringing on the rights of others.
