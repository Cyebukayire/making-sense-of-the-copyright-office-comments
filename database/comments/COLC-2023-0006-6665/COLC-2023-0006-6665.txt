I feel that most AI content as it currently exists should not be eligible for copyright. AI models rely on the theft of works created by humans to generate their content, and an image or piece of writing created by an algorithm making composites of artists&#39; work, often without their permission, should not be considered intellectual property. The use of AI models to spread misinformation is also concerning. AI software has no awareness or intention of its own; people who use it expecting an &#39;intelligence&#39; to create coherent work for them can end up with a product full of errors, such as a legal briefing full of invented legal precedents, while bad actors can use it to create faked photos or audio that can be used to fuel political bias and extremism. All this is often done by using copyrighted work without permission. I think AI technology has the potential to be useful in many situations, but in its current unregulated state it is violating the intellectual property rights of many creators and undermining the power of copyright law. For this reason I support regulation on AI technology and stronger copyright protections for creators, to prevent their work from being appropriated by an algorithm and used for others&#39; profit.
