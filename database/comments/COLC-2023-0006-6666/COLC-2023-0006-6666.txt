I am a man that organized years of my life towards the goal of being able to become a freelance artist, always while juggling other work to make ends meet. I made a lot of sacrifices to reach the skill level I have reached. Now I see that all that work means nothing because anyone can take my work and the work of any artist, run it through a machine without regard to any law, regulation or established norm, and make the entire field of passionate people who own the work used without their consent &quot;obsolete&quot;.<br/><br/>This whole thing is honestly an indictment of the idea that workers own what they produce, since it can all be taken away by any company with enough money. Not just for me, this is one setback among many working class people - and a statement about what really matters in our system. Money and who has it.
