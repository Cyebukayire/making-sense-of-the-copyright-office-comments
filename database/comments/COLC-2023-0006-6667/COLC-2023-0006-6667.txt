Hello. I am a voice actor for a popular video game from Riot Games. My voice, as well as others from this game, have been reproduced on many occasions by AI software in an unauthorized fashion. Aside from the non-consensual use of my voice, I am concerned for younger viewers who may not be able to tell the difference as well as the libelous possibilities since the AI can be told to say anything. Thanks for your time.
