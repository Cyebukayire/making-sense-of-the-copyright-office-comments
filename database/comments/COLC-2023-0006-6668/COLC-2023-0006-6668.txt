I do not think that AI-generated artworks or writing should be allowed any form of protection under copyright law. One of the reasons I paid for copyright documentation is because I wanted my human-made work to be distinct from the many artificially generated works online. AI images and written works can be generated at a much faster rate than any human being can produce a piece of writing or art, even with the assistance of normal editing software. I acknowledge that some skill is required in choosing prompts for the desired outcome in AI works, but this is nothing compared to the decades it takes to hone a craft. Is prompting to become the only skill of any value in the future? If AI works are allowed copyright protection, there will be no incentive for anyone to develop skills in the very human fields of writing and art. The specificity of human creativity is what makes it valuable; it draws from a small source of lived experiences and culture, not an impersonal global database. If people cannot earn a living from the arts, and they are relegated to becoming hobbies few have time for, we will become increasingly dependent on technology to think and imagine for us.
