AI is for all intents and purposes a plagiarism machine. To allow for this content to have the protections of copyright is a slap in the face to the hardworking real people who&rsquo;s work was stolen to feed the machine under the guise of &ldquo;learning.&rdquo; Nothing about AI is notable or proprietary and thus should not have access to being copy right or trade mark or any of the other legal protections that are in place. And none of this is Fair Use or anything by any stretch of the imagination that could be deemed as public domain. To copyright AI would be a gross misuse of the regulations that are meant to keep PEOPLE and their intellectual property safe.
