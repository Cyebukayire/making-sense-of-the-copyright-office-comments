Hello, I am an artist who finds the current application of AI especially disturbing in creative fields such as writing or art, due to the rampant and inherent theft by use of current sampling techniques implemented by the AI tools. This is unconstitutional and does not transform the work enough to merit usage. I don&rsquo;t believe AI will ever fully be decommissioned, so my opinion is that for AI to continue to be used, it needs to maintain an ethical boundary that protects human creators. The AI must only sample pieces of work that are completely free use. There absolutely must be boundaries placed on this tool, otherwise human artists will suffer in a multitude of ways. AI should only ever be used in ways to help humanity, not to steal or be used in unethical ways that go against our foundations and constitutional laws. If humans cannot and should not steal from other humans, artificial intelligence must also be held to that same standard, that human rights are held above the rights of AI tools, and that the law remains equal.
