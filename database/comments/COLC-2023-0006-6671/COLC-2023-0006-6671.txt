I&#39;m commenting image generator aspect. <br/>The plagiarism scripts are being used to take jobs away from working artists, images created in the style of the artists they no long have to pay. <br/>Plagiarism scripts only work because the training data was stolen without permission or compensation.  It may be technically legal to scrape the art and use it, but that&#39;s just because the technology didn&#39;t exist up to this point to steal art skills before. <br/>There is an argument used that humans learn like plagiarism scripts, so plagiarism scripts should be ok.  It&#39;s a false argument.   Human artists do reference other artists work to learn their skills. But humans evolve into their own styles. If they mimic too closely, they are plagiarists or forgers. <br/>Plagiarism scripts cannot be erased, but if their training sets are not acquired legally and ethical, they should not allowed to profit off stolen content. It is no different than a business that can&#39;t turn a profit without using underpaid illegal workers. <br/><br/> I don&#39;t care if hobbyists generate images, as long no profit is generated from the images. Using plagiarism script images trained from illegal sources for commercial use should be illegal. Any further training sets must acquired with permission and compensation if they are to be used commercially.
