Please continue to uphold and strengthen the current policy on artificial intelligence (AI) technology as described in &ldquo;Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence&rdquo;. Regulatory copyright language should explicitly state that AI-generated work is not copyrightable. Copyright law was and is designed to protect intellectual property from humans, and AI creations, by definition, do not come from intellect. They are algorithmically-generated works comprised of samples and inferences, and the AI sources do not have intrinsic rights with regard to them.
