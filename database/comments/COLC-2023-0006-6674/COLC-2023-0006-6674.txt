I will get straight to the point and say that my opinion of AI in workspaces is a negative one, especially in fields involving writing and art in any way. AI takes the hard work that others have put into their jobs and creates something that is typically not as well made or worth putting out into the world. The fact that some people want to use AI instead of the work of other talented people and workers is lazy and in many cases cruel. It not only could potentially take away jobs, but AI purposely takes other people&#39;s works, and copies and tears it apart to make something not well made and in some cases, things that don&#39;t even make sense. Thank you for your time in reading this, and letting my opinion be heard.
