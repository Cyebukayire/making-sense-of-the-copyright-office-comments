Due to the nature of how AI models are trained, which is very similar to how a human learns, it is not correct to consider AI-generated content as violating copyright. There is a misconception that an AI model stores the actual training data, for example, a book, and is copy-pasting that into its responses. In reality, the relationship between words and concepts has been distilled into a distributed model of language. Just like when a person reads a book they do not store the book in its entirety, but their neurons change and adapt to having read the book, and the impression the book made on the individual is distributed across various parts of the brain.<br/><br/>Neither should training an AI model be considered a violation of copyright. It is not a violation of copyright for an artist or author to look at others&#39; works to learn about drawing, composition, and what makes a good story or piece of art. In fact, it is the way in which all artists learn. <br/><br/>If we consider training an AI model to be a violation of copyright it would be technically incorrect, and merely an attempt at minimizing the potential disruption that such powerful systems could create. If we want to make new rules governing AI and copyright specific to computer-generated content we can, but as it stands now I think we would be merely bending the law to our will to avoid the potential pains of growth. While I understand the concern and fear, there is a great we could gain from training AI systems, and creating impediments to this emerging technology simply to protect the status quo does not seem like a good idea.<br/><br/>I think the best thing we can do is allow this technology to advance, give it all of the highest quality training data available, and see where the limits are. If we cling too tightly to what we already have we may be kicking against what ultimately is the most powerful and beneficial technology to ever grace the human race. <br/><br/>As they say, a closed hand can never receive.
