AI uses copyrighted content as training data in order to produce uncopyrighted content. As such, it is a borderline form of piracy. It harms the income of larger creation studios and art teams by stealing their work to produce an inferior product for a fraction of the cost. AI models should not be permitted to use any content (that they are not licensed to use) as training data.
