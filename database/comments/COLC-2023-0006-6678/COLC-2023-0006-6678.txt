Thank you for opening this conversation to the American public. <br/>Unchecked AI use is a threat to people who get their livelihoods from creative fields like artists, composers, voice actors, and writers. I am not myself any of these things, but I have seen the fear in these people over losing their jobs and being replaced by robots and no longer able to support themselves due to the greed of large companies looking to cut costs. <br/>AI can only combine and reconfigure what is already out in the world. It uses people&rsquo;s intellectual property to &ldquo;create&rdquo; new, similar works. Often, it uses copyrighted material in this process, and while the final result may not look exactly like its basis, this is dangerous. It is not the same as getting inspiration from popular works in the way a human might because rather than summarizing them and then going on creatively from there, it uses the actual pixels and words from this material. <br/>It is a threat to creativity itself. AI cannot make something new, and in our capitalist economy the only feasable incentive for most adults to create is the money that can be made from it. If companies can get that by legally stealing past work our culture of creativity and art will crumble. Slowly, seemingly innocently, and maybe unnoticable at first. <br/>I do not know very much about copyright law, so maybe this is a fantasy. But it seems to me like it should be illegal to use copyrighted work to train AI. And if copyrighted work is not used, people and companies should only be able to use AI to produce works that do not bring them money, seeing as it&rsquo;s not their own work. <br/>I also think that there needs to be a new category of intellectual property. I grew up using &ldquo;CC&rdquo; images, and the ones that say educational purpose without financial motivation only, in google to put into school google slides presentations on whatever we were studying in class. This was before modern AI was really a thing, before it was realistic to say your art or work would likely be used to train something that you may consider as a dangerous &ldquo;replacement&rdquo;. My use of those images was what those artists had in mind for their art to be used for. I therefore think there needs to be a new designation for art whose artists want their work to be in creative commons with the exception of being used by AI bots. So many people are against it that it doesn&rsquo;t seem fair that&rsquo;s not an option.<br/>If using AI to complete an assignment for a class, whether writing or drawing or code, is morally wrong and can get you reprimanded or kicked out of your school, there seems to be no reason that doing the same thing with the purpose of making money within a company setting should be any less punished- indeed, if you&rsquo;re getting money for it without compensating the artists adequately, shouldn&rsquo;t that be considered much, much worse?<br/><br/>Thank you for listening and I hope you will do the right thing for the future of our country, our culture, our freedom, and our children.
