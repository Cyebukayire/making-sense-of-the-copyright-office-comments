AI poses a threat to working artists everywhere. <br/><br/>(&ldquo;Artists&rdquo; in this case refers to any visual artist, musical artist, writer, or voice actor&mdash;anyone who creates art).<br/><br/>Art takes LABOR. This is a fact, not a theoretical argument. Even if it is often enjoyable and a vehicle of self-expression, it still takes years of study, practice and struggle to learn and use effectively. As such, artists deserve to be fairly compensated for their work, and that work must be protected by copyright laws.<br/><br/>AI art is created by a computer from a database of preexisting art. It takes no effort to produce on behalf of the &ldquo;prompter.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s as easy as typing a phrase into a search bar. The issue is with that database&mdash;it often contains work that was collected without the original artists&rsquo; permissions. At the moment, nothing is stopping anyone from appropriating these massive databases of stolen art and profiting from them. The fact that AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; tends to be full of errors, inaccuracies and therefore of lower quality is also of concern, but the main issue is whether it is legally defensible at all. <br/><br/>Consider: Why should another person be allowed to use a computer program to quite literally plagiarize the labor of artists&mdash;and then be allowed to copyright, and profit from, that stolen material, when no work has actually been done on their part? In what universe would this behavior be considered legal by a civilized nation that supposedly values their artists?<br/><br/>By allowing thieves to steal from artists without consequence&mdash;whether this is a random internet seller trying to make a quick buck off an actual artist&rsquo;s work, or a media corporation asking actors to sign away their likeness for indefinite future use without royalties&mdash;this undermines actual working artists, who were willing to put forth the time, effort, capital and creativity to pursue their passion.<br/><br/>How do we envision our future? Is it one in which nothing is original and everything is a soulless rehash of art that has already been made? Art that is full of meaningless inaccuracies? Art that offers no insight into the human condition?<br/><br/>Or do we envision a future in which art and artists are protected, have legal recourse, and can flourish?<br/><br/>If we as a society want to CONTINUE to have art, then we must ensure the protection of the ARTISTS that actually make it.
