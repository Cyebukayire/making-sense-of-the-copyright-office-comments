The rise of AI technology is proving to be a danger to creative and informative professions. Artists who utilize social media to promote their work and advertise commissions are seeing their hard work scraped and stolen and mashed up to be spat out in seconds, with no credit. They are actively losing money and work as their consumer base is turning to quick and easy AI generators.<br/><br/>WAG and SAG-AFTRA are striking in part due to AI. The guilds are expressing concerns that their work will be scraped, the writers will be pushed out from their jobs while studios us AI for scripts, and actors are having their voices stolen for AI generated work.<br/><br/>We have seen AI be used to write journalistic articles and legal documentations, including falsified cases to support the text it is writing. In academics, students are turning to AI to write essays or research papers, and those that are not are being accused by their professors of doing so. We are losing our ability to determine human work from computer generated work, and computer generated work is being accepted as original with the potential to be spread and monetized.<br/><br/>As an aspiring author, I have major concerns about what the rise of AI is going to do to the publications field. When will the work of real people be dismissed for the quick turn around of an AI generated story (a problem already occurring in the transformative work sphere)? When will publishers decide that&rsquo;s fast AI generated novel will make more money than a lovingly, painfully, and emotionally crafted novel by a person who put in the time it takes to create properly? When will we as creatives have our work lose all of its value because AI can make a faster buck?<br/><br/>If AI programs are left unchecked and works using stolen content are continued to be allowed and posted and monetized, it is my belief that we will see the death of what makes us human: our ability to create art and share information freely.<br/><br/>When AI was discussed in science fiction and treated as a far off reality, it was always portrayed as a system to make human lives easier. It would streamline services. It would be a virtual assistant. It would do the menial jobs so humans could pursue work and passions that are meaningful; this includes art, creative writing, and journalistic ventures. What we are seeing happening is the exact opposite of what every imagination has come up with. AI as it stands is removing the creative work of humans and turning us into machines. We are not machines. AI is not human. AI cannot have a right to creativity or creative works. The day it does is a day in which we have lost the right to be human.<br/><br/>Creative works are not meant to be stolen. They are not meant to be fodder for a computer system to take and chew and destroy and put back together in a semblance of what they once were. They are not meant to be mimicked by technology. They are certainly not meant to be taken by someone else and sold without consent.<br/><br/>I would like to ponder the following quote from the 2004 movie &ldquo;iRobot&rdquo;, in which Will Smith&rsquo;s character asks &ldquo;Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot take a blank canvas and turn it into a masterpiece?&rdquo;. While this was turned back on his character, the point stood as the imagery Sonny drew was an image programmed into him. Sonny was an intelligent and independent robot, but he had limitations and could not independently create. That is something reserved for humankind.<br/><br/>That is the reality of generative AI. It will never be able to create from nothing. Every work it can produce will be a mashup of stolen work from humans who did not consent for their work to be taken. It will never be original. It will never be true creation. We need to stop pretending it is. We need to stop the progression of digital theft. We need to stop the monetization of stolen work. We need to protect creatives, and our right as humans to create.
