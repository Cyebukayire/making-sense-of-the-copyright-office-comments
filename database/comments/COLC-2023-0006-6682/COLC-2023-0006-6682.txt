&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; isn&#39;t intelligence, it&#39;s applied statistics. It has no thought nor creativity and does not need nor have any use for copyright protections. Humans do have use of copyright protections. Apply copyright to those to whom it is useful and intended. Thanks. <br/><br/>(PS: The irony of having to confirm one is not a robot in order to reply is noted, and should be a hint about how this should go.)
