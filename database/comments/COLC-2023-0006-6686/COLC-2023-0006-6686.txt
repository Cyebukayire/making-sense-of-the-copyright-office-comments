The nature of &ldquo;AI&rdquo; generated content is that of an aggregator: to use AI is not to generate wholly new creation but to reference a large sum of material and to directly copy and reassemble portions of it, giving it only the &gt;appearance&lt; of something new.<br/><br/>To attempt to copyright an AI creation as original is akin to copyrighting the results of an internet search; it is simply not original material.
