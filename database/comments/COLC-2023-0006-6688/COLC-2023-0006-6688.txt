Generative A.I. is too much of a grey area when it comes to copyright. Because users of it may argue they have created something new in the same process a human would, but anyone who actually creates will easily tell you otherwise. A machine cannot reinterpret an idea. It cannot give you wildly different options in creative ways. It doesn&#39;t have a flexible sense of logic like a person. It takes what it is given and amalgamates an approximation of what it&#39;s asked for from that. And all the data that generative A.I. has been given is stolen wholesale from the internet. There was no chance for anyone to opt in to contribute. The process to remove data is left to the individual affected because databases assume no responsibility for their own efforts. Said process is often difficult and confusing to the layperson, they wouldn&#39;t know where to start. What&#39;s worse is that these databases don&#39;t focus on just creative works. It&#39;s already been proven that they scrape private information as well. Medical records have been found in databases before. This is, plain and simple, an invasion of privacy and breach of such laws. Data collection is entirely indiscriminate and unmoderated with no accountability. There is no telling what else is or will be added and from where.<br/><br/>Corporations like Adobe now implement by default data collection from their users. Many professionals in industry jobs use Adobe for work as it has been an industry standard for decades. This puts at risk the IP of publishers and studios when the work their artists/designers/writers use those programs and someone else gets to freely benefit from that labor.<br/><br/>This easily also creates a security and information risk. Because generative A.I. is already used to imitate the likeness and voice of people. You will find many videos on youtube of A.I. imitating the voices of living American presidents. This could extend to Congresspeople and those of high rank in secret or armed forces before we know it. Again, this is a breach of privacy and potentially security with the ability to create misinformation.<br/><br/>Ultimately, generative A.I. uses what it doesn&#39;t own or have permission to in order to build something the same way predictive text works. Sometimes for worse than one may initially anticipate. This is dangerous on legal grounds and safety grounds. It is dangerous to more people than just creative workers and performers. It could upset the job market, economy, and government authority for the sake of profit for a few who refuse to do actual work as functioning members of society.<br/><br/>Do not permit generative A.I. to have any copyright protections. It will only encourage the abuse of hardworking people and the privacy and safety of the general public and government.
