1. As described above, generative AI systems have the ability to produce material that would be copyrightable [...]<br/><br/>My view of AI currently is nigh-catastrophic. For a technology that has been pitched to the public as a grand jump in what we&#39;re capable of, the most dramatic effect I have personally witnessed is AI/ML threatening the livelihoods of artists and writers who already are forced to subsist on sub-par wages.<br/><br/>6. What kinds of copyright-protected[...]<br/><br/>6.1. How or where do developers of AI models acquire the materials or datasets that their [...]<br/><br/>OpenAI, one of the big language learning models, was recently discovered to be trained on fanfiction of all things. There was no request for access to fanfic authors&#39; work. It just happened, because it&#39;s assumed that anything posted publicly online is scrappable. This is deeply demoralizing and also seems like an incredibly stupid stance. Does every public article of a news site become fair game? If I copy and pasted someone&#39;s work and posted it as my own, I would rightly be dragged over the coals, and if I were financially benefiting from that theft I would deserve to be sued.<br/><br/>I am fine with public domain work or work that is directly commissioned by developers to be used in learn models. For me, it is extremely important that people OPT INTO these data models, not be tricked into OPT OUT systems.<br/><br/>Also, the idea that a large collection of written or artistic work might be offered up to teach large scale models. Lets say a massive site that has been active for a very long time, such as ArtStation, suddenly emails ALL USERS to say &quot;Hello, we are going to share your personal artwork with this AI/ML data set. If you do NOT want to be included, let us know!&quot;<br/><br/>That&#39;s a fine idea but is equally useless. What about users who have changed email addresses and miss that vitally important email? What about people who have moved onto new sites? What about people who have PASSED AWAY who stand to lose this basic protection of their work through zero fault of their own?<br/><br/>The only ethical data sets are ones that the artists OPT INTO with full understanding of the process.<br/><br/>8. Under what circumstances would the unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train AI models constitute fair use?[...]<br/><br/>There is no circumstance where unauthorized use of copyright works should be used to train AI. Fair Use should not apply to AI/ML because when a human being creates work protected by Fair Use, there is intentionality and interpretation happening. An AI is reacting to a prompt. There is no intentionality or interpretation, only using someone else&#39;s work to generate more of that exact work.<br/><br/>8.3. The use of copyrighted materials in a training [...]Does it make a difference if funding for these noncommercial [...]<br/><br/>I love these questions here because the initial questions made me think &quot;well perhaps for research purposes it would be ethical&quot; but the subsequent two additions reminded me why, no, actually, it would not be ethical. In the same way Accuweather profits off the work of the NOAA, the perfect ethical dream of a Moral Use Of AI would inevitably be turned into profit. No. Keep copyrighted and unauthorized work out of datasets, even non-profit and research-focused AI/ML.<br/><br/>9. Should copyright owners have to affirmatively consent (opt in) [...]<br/><br/>Opt in with robust, easily-understand parameters and legal agreements is the only acceptable consent. Opt out is not viable for the reasons I described above.<br/><br/>9.4. If an objection is not honored, what remedies should be [...]<br/><br/>I think if the objection is not honored, the owner of the dataset should be forced to either discard the entire dataset immediately or to give 100% royalities to every single result of that data set. I want the punishment for not honoring such a request to be so severe it completely dictates the way these things are operated.<br/><br/>15. In order to allow copyright owners to[...]<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>18. Under copyright law, are there circumstances when a human [...]<br/><br/>The only situation where AI-generated work should be copyrightable is if the dataset was exclusively sourced from the author. <br/><br/>20. Is legal protection for AI-generated material desirable [...]<br/><br/>I don&#39;t care. I feel like I have watched AI/ML generated art go from an interesting oddity to a massive threat to truth, art, writing, and the livelihoods of everyone who makes a logo for a new soda, who does art commissions of people&#39;s pets, who writes bestselling novels, who works as a script doctor. <br/><br/>The people behind this technology have proven over and over and over and over EXHAUSTIVELY that are willing to screw over every creative person they can all in the name of profit. I don&#39;t think generative AI is &#39;ready for prime time&#39; so to speak and until these issues are resolved, I don&#39;t care about encouraging the development of the technology. Because they&#39;ve proven they don&#39;t care about art and the human labor behind it.
