I&#39;m a visual arts educator. A lot of the talk about AI-generated images in education is the lack of ownership and transparency. When I have students submit pictures or discuss thinking about using AI for their assignments, it&#39;s basically a disservice to the engagement of the content material required. Other schools have policies that limit the use of AI for text generation, but in the art sphere, there&#39;s not much action towards it from an administration side other than plagiarism and digital citizenship. If there are regulations on AI images, especially for educational spaces, then it will help mitigate such concerns.
