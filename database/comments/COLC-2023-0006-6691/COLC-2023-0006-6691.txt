AI is not art, there is no originality behind it as it is trained on art made by people that have actually studied, trained and developed the skill necessary to create true original work. Letting people run a prompt through an algorithm to create disjointed, subpar work is only going to make it harder for true artists to have their work respected and even seen in a sea of opportunists expecting to get rich by copyrighting something generated at the push of a button.  Artists are already being looked down upon for being upset about their art stolen and work belittled, meanwhile publishing companies are closing submissions due to waves of AI generated stories they can&#39;t reasonably sift through.  It will become harder for artists to be respected, let alone capable of making any sort of living on their work when it is compared to AI work, meanwhile AI work will only become a greater and greater problem as it starts an unsustainable cycle where its only option is to train on other AI images, creating worse and worse end results.<br/>I love writing, but the thought of someone creating work at a push of a button after training a system on another writer and claiming it&#39;s just as valid as the heart, soul and thought that takes to creating a world and being able to sell it as equal to anything I make is so disheartening it drains any hope of actually sharing my stories with the world and hoping for them to be loved and accepted.  Art is a human experience that brings meaning to life, not something to be ran through an algorithm to create a profit by people that have no respect for the time or skill for the very art they trained these wretched machines on.
