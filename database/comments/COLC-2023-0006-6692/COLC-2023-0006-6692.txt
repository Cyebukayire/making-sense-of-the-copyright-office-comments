Unregulated artificial intelligence is the issue. While it both positively and negatively affects many industries and lives, I&#39;d like to specifically talk about my own: voice acting. I am a full-time voice actor and provide for my family using the funds from my craft, which I&#39;ve been studying and honing since 1996. I act, I teach, produce, direct, and more. As you&#39;re undoubtably aware, generative artificial intelligence has made its way to voice acting through synthesized speech. While there are legitimate cases of AI use in products, vast percentage have so far been unethical by bad actors feeding voice actors&#39; publicly available performances into AI to generate speech that was not consented to. For now, it&#39;s funny videos and song covers on YouTube and TikTok, but we are not too terribly far from politicians singing about the Holocaust. <br/><br/>AI is a wonderful tool - and that is where it must remain. It cannot replace human imagination and creativity. All it can do is ingest the existing content and generate content that is of resemblance. Due to this, at some point at this rate, there will be no new art. Music, theatre, film, and other art of original inspiration/imagination/creativity will end. And at the rate at which this is happening, we&#39;re not looking too far into the future, either.<br/><br/>People&#39;s livelihoods are at stake. The hundreds of thousands of on-the-ground actors who are not 5-star celebrities. As well as the directors, crew, production staff, and everyone in between. The human spirit, of creativity and imagination, is at stake. All in the name of profit and greed. <br/><br/>How much longer will it be before AI starts replacing humans in other - and continuously expanding - capacities? It truly is a scary thought. Please work quickly and act quickly to regulate AI.<br/><br/> For my industry, a beginning step is to make human biometrics copyrightable. As far as I understand it (I&#39;m not a lawyer), biometrics isn&#39;t something that can be owned by an individual. But my voice (and my likeness) is my content. It is my product, and the service I offer. It is my brand. Much like how I cannot create a dark-brown soda from my garage and sell it with a &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; label, others must not be able to distribute my voice in my likeness. <br/><br/>One organization I&#39;d like to point to is the National Association of Voice Actors who have been on the forefront of AI in voice acting, sharing resources, education, awareness, and more. <br/><br/>https://navavoices.org/synth-ai<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to speak up about this issue. I&#39;m one of the fortunate ones who have found a passion that intersects with work, which allows me to enjoy my American dream (I&#39;m an immigrant, now a naturalized citizen) while being a responsible husband and dad to my two boys. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
