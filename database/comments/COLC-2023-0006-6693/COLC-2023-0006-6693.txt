I have a college degree in Simulation, Animation and Gaming. The unregulated use of AI tools by companies and individuals is actively threatening my ability to get jobs in my field. It makes me feel sick that all the art I posted online to build my career, can be stolen at any time and used without my permission in the name of &ldquo;technological advancement&rdquo;. Art theft is not technological advancement. It is crime, and it is the type of crime that hurts artists, a vulnerable group, in very real ways. AI scraping of non-consenting artists&rsquo; work should not exist. AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; as a whole, should not exist. It is not artificial intelligence. It is simple theft. And it is not art. It is a mockery of what artists work so hard and spend many years to accomplish. This cannot be allowed to continue; the very livelihoods of artists like me are at stake.
