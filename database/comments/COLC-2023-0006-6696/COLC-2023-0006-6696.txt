There is no world in which AI copyrighting is ethical or right. Each piece made by AI is simply a mess of stolen and jumbled works made by the hands of someone else. Entering in a prompt and receiving another person&#39;s hard work is not art. AI has its place but it is simply not ever in a copyrighted capacity.
