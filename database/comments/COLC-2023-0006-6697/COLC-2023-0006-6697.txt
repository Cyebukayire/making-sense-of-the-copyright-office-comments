I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in this topic and its consideration of public feedback. I am an artist and author whose work appears online. The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works. While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.  To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies. I think the current AI models are built on unethically sourced work and content, and therefore should not be allowed to continue or grow. It is my opinion that these models need to be destroyed, and if there are to be replacements, they should exclusively use training data with permission from the rightful copyright owners.
