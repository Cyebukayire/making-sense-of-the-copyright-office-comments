AI-generated works of any kind should not be able to be copyrighted, as such works are only generated from existing/stolen work and cannot contain anything new or transformative (as the AI system is incapable of actual thought and feeling) and is therefore just dressed-up plagiarism. Works created by humans should be protected; AI can only make rip-offs and imitations. Do not protect plagiarists or allow them to profit from their theft. AI-generated works hurt true creators who have spent years honing their craft and deserve fair compensation for their labor and expertise. AI is a soulless shortcut that destroys the point of art - human expression.
