I believe all works of copyrighted material should only be used by the write or with the writer express permission. Meaning AI should not be able to use their works to generate new works. Allowing AI to do this would take work, monies, and ideas away from the writer. I think AI has it place but needs to be closely monitored to make sure writers, play writes, reporters etc.... don&#39;t have to worry about their jobs/livelihood taken from them.
