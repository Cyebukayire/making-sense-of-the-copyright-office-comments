How is this even a debate, people are losing jobs and having THEIR work stolen, in one of your documents you literally stated &ldquo;&hellip;the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models and whether this constitutes infringement&hellip;&rdquo; UOU SAID COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE. It should not be copyright they are stealing human art and things we took years to master in order for their gain to teach a robot to do it in seconds, it is not the future it is a job killer and a home wrecker at this point. AI is deliberately stealing the work of hard working adults and stealing money from those who&rsquo;s lives depend on it. As for the voices, yes do not use them for competitions, no it shouldn&rsquo;t be copyright either and it most definitely should not replace real musicians. A friend of mine lost their entire lively hood because someone had taken their artwork and shoved it into a bot and stole her work selling it for cheaper and taking her following by using her art, HER COPYRIGHT.
