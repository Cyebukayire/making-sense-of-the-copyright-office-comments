Government regulation and copyright law might be the only thing to stop film studios from using AI to generate entire films and series. The technology already exists, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they start creating entire series using AI. <br/><br/>I am a set decorator. I design film sets. Currently, I can&rsquo;t even put a painting on a set wall if it looks too much like an existing painting, Bc it&rsquo;s protected by copyright law!! Actors should have at least the same level of protection that a Thomas Kincaid painting does! <br/><br/>Netflix just posted a job listing for an AI content manager, for $900k/year!! While we are on strike, the studios are pursuing AI.<br/><br/>If studios don&rsquo;t need to film real actors, they don&rsquo;t need film sets. Or props. Or costumes and makeup. Or sound stages. Or cameras. Or grips, or electrics, or sound operators, or craft services&hellip;.<br/><br/>They don&rsquo;t need to feed the crew lunch, or rent locations, or rent trucks. They don&rsquo;t need hotels or flights, or to rent office space.<br/><br/>If studios are allowed to start doing this now, at first it will be clumsy and shaky, but give it 5, 10 years. 20 years. 50 years. AI will get better and better, and become the norm. Live action filming will go the way of 35mm film stock. Using real actors and sets will become a thing of the past&hellip; &ldquo;Old Timey&rdquo;. Something that only the most eccentric and traditional directors will demand.<br/><br/>We see it today with using Digital vs Film stock. With Greenscreen vs Visual Fx. If it&rsquo;s cheaper, digital always wins.<br/><br/>If AI is cheaper and with no risk, AI will win. <br/><br/>AI doesn&rsquo;t call in sick, doesn&rsquo;t need bathroom breaks or air conditioning, doesn&rsquo;t have capped hours or overtime pay, doesn&rsquo;t need health insurance or benefits, doesn&rsquo;t go on strike.<br/><br/>The government needs to pass copyright protections. Regulations are the only way to stop this. If you try to make a commercial product from an actors likeness, you face a lawsuit. It makes AI more expensive and less appealing.<br/><br/>I hate the idea of more government regulation, but our whole industry may depend on it.<br/><br/>AI is an amazing tool - I love using it to assist with the creative process and to help develop ideas. But when AI replaces everything, and becomes the actual product, we&rsquo;re all in trouble.
