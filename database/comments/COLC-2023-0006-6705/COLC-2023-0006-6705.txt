As an artist, I don&#39;t think that people should be able to copyright works made with AI. The process of making AI art is dishonest at best and actively harmful at worst. I don&#39;t want to have my work used to train an AI, but this has become an issue so prevalent that I don&#39;t really have a way to stop it anymore. I count myself lucky that no one has used AI to copy my style yet, but I dread the day that it happens. This isn&#39;t right. It isn&#39;t right to let an AI skim the internet, learning from works that people intended to be viewed, not copied, so it can produce a hollow copy of someone else&#39;s work. In no universe should artwork made by AI be able to be copyrighted.
