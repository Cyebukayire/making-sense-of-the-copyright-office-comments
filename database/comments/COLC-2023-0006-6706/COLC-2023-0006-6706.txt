Hello,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today to voice my strong opposition to AI having any ability to copyright its work without human involvement, as well as my opposition to penalties for infringing upon AI generated work. I do not think AI should be using copyrighted material in its training material, and I do not think AI should be able to imitate human artists. I am a human artist, and I believe art belongs to humans, not machines. AI does not have &quot;rights&quot; in the way that humans do because it is not a living thing. I urge you to exercise caution and thoughtful judgement regarding any new copyright laws regarding AI, and to consider how they may effect real human artists moving forward.<br/><br/>Thank you
