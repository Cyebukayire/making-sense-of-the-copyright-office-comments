I believe there are sufficient concerns and points raised in the Notice to warrant rigid guidelines and regulations on artificially generated content across all mediums. My view is that while there are untold benefits from the curation of this technology down the road, artificially generated content should be subject to as much- if not more- regulatory scrutiny in regards to copyright infringement and the use of a person&#39;s likeness. The use of artificially generated content in a for-profit manner seems to be one of the most hotly contested issues, as there are many parties involved with a lot to gain or lose. In terms of artificially generated content that aims to be copyrighted, distributed for sale, or used in marketing campaigns, full transparency should be maintained on the kinds of assets used to generate the content, the human involvement in the generation of the content, and the representation of the fact that this material was generated with artificial intelligence. This approach protects both the party trying to copyright content as they have readily available proof that no infringement was done in the generation of their work, and provides other parties with clear grounds for dispute if their copyrighted works appear in the dataset used to train. Fair and legally permissible use of artificially generated content should be facilitated. However, there is sufficient precedent in copyright law (as pointed out in several sections of the Notice) to apply equally stringent protections against illegal use of works, likenesses, and other already protected attributes of a person or type of content. I am glad the U.S. Copyright Office is taking this matter seriously, and hope that due diligence on these regulations causes the least amount of undue stress as can be possible. Thank you.
