Copyrighting AI-derived works is not only unethical but also impossible. By definition AI collects data from many sources and creates amalgamations of this content. There is no way for AI to credit the original creators, because the AI result is the result of folding in many sources - including individuals who are using AI personally to provide it with more data for their own projects, but whose personal contribution is later used by the AI to add to strangers&#39; projects that they may monetize. Copyrighting this generated material would be rewarding the act of stealing from others.
