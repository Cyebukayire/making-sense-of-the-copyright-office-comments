I personally utilize Google Docs to write as a hobby. Utilizing google&#39;s service allows me to share my hobby with friends all around the US and in other countries. I do not like that an AI drive can skim my works to create its own story using my concepts. I do not think that AI art works should belong to anyone except the public domain as artists work for years to master their techniques and AI recreates aspects of their works. Creative outlet often equates to life experiences that shape each individual&#39;s works. AI can&#39;t experience human emotion nor harship which is why it must scan human creations. Barring AI copyright will not hinder AI use in the slightest. It only levels the playing field as the technologies steal information from honest folks just trying to make a living.
