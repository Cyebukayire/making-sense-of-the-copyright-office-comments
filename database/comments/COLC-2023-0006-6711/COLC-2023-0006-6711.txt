AI models should not be allowed to use copyrighted material without express permission from the copyright holder. This is how copyright is designed to function and how it&#39;s always worked, scraping a massive pool of data does not and should not exempt you from this requirement.<br/>AI-generated material should not be able to be copyrighted. Using AI it&#39;s trivially easy for an individual to generate every single permutation of an idea or content, and thus hold the rights to more ideas than was previously reasonable or possible for a single human to do. Copyright is for human-created efforts only.<br/>Copyright liability should fall to the owner of the AI, if your AI breaks copyright then you as the owner are liable. This ensures that companies will not use AI generation legal loopholes to avoid responsibility.
