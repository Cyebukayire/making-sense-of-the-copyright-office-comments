Two principals that I would suggest might mitigate the issues AI presents towards copyright:<br/><br/>1) Anything created by Artificial Intelligence should not be eligible for copyright.  Copyright exist to encourage humans to do the hard work of creating, machines do not need nor should they get the benefit of copyright.  Having a human operator or human editor of an AI work should not grant it copyright as the &quot;creation&quot; was done by machine.<br/><br/>2) For machine created works, only, artist should be able to copyright styles.  While copyright does not protect styles for human imitating styles, machine emulation of style is a fundamentally different activity. The ability to duplicated a machine &quot;artist&quot; that has learned a style means that the style itself has become a product.  And creating a style represents a good deal of creative work that requires a human to do at this point. A machine algorithm that can consistently produce a style should be considered a human made artwork itself and subject to copyright restrictions.
