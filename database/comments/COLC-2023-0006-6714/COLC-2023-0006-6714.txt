The issue, I think, comes down to how generative AI is trained. If it were trained purely on a single person&#39;s work, anything it generates should be property of that person. When trained on multiple people&#39;s work, its results should belong to whoever owns that work. The issue is that most, if not all of these algorithms, are trained without the explicit written permission of the people whose works are being used. Unless given full rights by the creator, it should be illegal to use their works for this purpose, but these works are being either mined against their creators&#39; wishes, or often a line is being added to the terms of service of a website that says something tantamount to &quot;we own whatever you upload&quot; but it is purposefully hidden behind dozens of pages of text that as a result, don&#39;t get read, and while that is technically on the users for not reading the terms of the agreements they are agreeing to, it does bring up the fact that companies would not be able to do certain things like own anything you upload without a contract explicitly stating just that or using your own work to make you obsolete without your explicit permission. Personally, I feel like if there isn&#39;t an individual contract for every single piece of work used to train a generative AI algorithm signed by the creator of the work giving full rights to its use to the algorithm&#39;s creator/owner, it should be illegal to use it in such a way and they should be forced to erase it from its training. Furthermore, the creators of the original work who did not give explicit permission should be compensated for work lost for every single piece created by the algorithm using their works, as that is money that was effectively stolen from them by taking away their work. I say these things, not being a professional artist in any way, simply as a person who understands the work these people put into their craft and doesn&#39;t want to see it go away because it&#39;s cheaper to steal their work than it is to pay them for it
