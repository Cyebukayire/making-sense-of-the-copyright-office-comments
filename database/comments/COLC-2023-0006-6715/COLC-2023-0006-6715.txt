There is no way to put a copyright on anything made with AI since it&#39;s all computer generated from other people&#39;s work. Everything in the databases of most, if not all, of these AI generators is either user submitted or pulled from websites with nothing in place to make sure the images or text being used even CAN be used without infringing on another person or company&#39;s copyright or trademark. Most of the images or text being used in these AI image and text generators are more than likely already infringing on a person or company&#39;s copyright or trademark.
