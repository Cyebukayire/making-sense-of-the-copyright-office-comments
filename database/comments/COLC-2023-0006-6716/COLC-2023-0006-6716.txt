Generative artificial intelligence, while undoubtedly revolutionary and full of potential, produces, in its current state, a hodgepodge of stolen content. AI requires input in order to generate output &mdash; and the only true input we have is things that humans have created, things humans have crafted and thought about and poured their emotions into. AI is just that, artificial. It has no metaphorical soul, it has no emotions, it has no life experiences, it is not human; at least, not yet.<br/>At this stage it would be grossly inappropriate to treat generative artificial intelligence as anything other than a tool which can be used to either merge preexisting content together or turn it into another form. We cannot allow this content to either be exempt from copyright laws nor be protected by them &mdash; we need to protect human creativity above all else.
