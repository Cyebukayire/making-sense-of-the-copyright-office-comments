Personally, I think AI AT ALL, right now, is being used ONLY to take away jobs from people because companies want to increase their bottom line. When it&#39;s not companies, it&#39;s people trying to cut artists&#39; out of the process of creating art - in any form - because &quot;they think AI can do it just as well&quot; - but all it does is steals from artists. AI is being used in a way that removes people, our creativity, our humanity and our ability to use our skills, talents, and dreams in a way that leaves us feeling fulfilled - and sometimes also contributes to society in many different forms. <br/><br/>I fully believe that AI as it stands right now, is nothing but a negative to society, culture and the economy as a whole and shouldn&#39;t be allowed to continue. If AI &quot;&quot;must&quot;&quot; be a part of society, we need to put a freeze on ANYONE using it outside of testing how it works, until we have strict rules in place that prevent it from being used to replace people. AI COULD be a helpful tool alongside actual human beings, BUT it is NOT and should NEVER be a replacement for them. AI is only as good as the people who make it, and right now a lot of the people making it are horrible people. <br/><br/>In regards to Copyright issues with AI, I believe that things made solely through AI should NOT be considered copyrightable at all, as computers do not have any rights. Yes, a human being used AI, but it is doing all the work for you. Putting in specific words to generate art, or writing, ect. should not be considered enough to achieve copyright. <br/>Now, if a person used AI as a tool to HELP them create something, rather than being the only/majority of the contribution to the end result, that should be copyrightable. Copyright has always been about carving out a space for the PEOPLE involved in creating something to retain the rights to their work.
