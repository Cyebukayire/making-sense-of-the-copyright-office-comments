There is no such thing as artificial intelligence, only data mining or data scraping. It&rsquo;s infringing on millions of artists and writers intellectual copyright from works to manufacture something so someone can say that they &ldquo;made it&rdquo;. It could be an incredibly useful tool but as Ghandi said &ldquo;What I object to is the &lsquo;craze&rsquo; for machinery, not machine as such&hellip; The supreme consideration is man. The machine should not tend to make atrophied the limbs of man.&rdquo; AI can be a tool perhaps with more development but as it stands it will work it&rsquo;s hardest to atrophy the limbs of man while stealing from the hard work of others.
