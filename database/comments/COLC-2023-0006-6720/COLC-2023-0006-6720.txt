AI generated results should not be protected by copyright. These kind of programmes are trained on billions of licensed data without any consent or compensation. (Which is highly unethical)<br/><br/>Another reason why AI generated results shouldn&#39;t be protected by copyright is to ensure that individual creators are safe from exploitation and corporations abusing with the generative AI. If AI generated content can&#39;t be protected by copyright, then companies won&#39;t find generative AI programs useful to make the product, therefore individual creators will still be competitive in the market.
