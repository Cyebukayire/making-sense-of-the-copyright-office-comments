With the rumblings of using AI being used in all media, there needs to be very strict limitations on it. AI is taking from previously made works and mashing them up into works that never make sense. The art looks horrible, script make no sense and the idea of using AI to replicate people is bordering on federal laws. Greedy companies trying to use AI to save money are playing with fire and are already getting burned. These programs should not be available to the public ever and needs to be reigned in.
