I make my living as an artist. I strongly believe that allowing the copyright and monetization of generative AI works will be damaging to everyone who likewise works in creative fields. Many existing AI tools are fed by scraping work indiscriminately, and so what they produce is akin to plagarism. They infringe on our intellectual property, denying us credit and potential income from the use of our labor. I don&#39;t believe it qualifies as fair use either, given that there can be no intent behind AI generation. It is not a true &quot;intelligence,&quot; and only acts according to its programming. There is no thought behind the work, as there might be behind, for example, a human artist creating a collage.<br/><br/>The very existence of AI work also throws the work of real artists into question. Our creations are scrutinized in ways they weren&#39;t previously, with creators being accused of using AI when their work bears some resemblance to particular sentence structures or rendering techniques. I&#39;m not sure this is a bell that can be unrung, but if generative AI can&#39;t be profitable, then that reduces incentive into its development and usage, minimizing its footprint.<br/><br/>I believe a reasonable case could be made for permitting the copyright of works which utilize AI, where the AI can be shown to be fed solely on data it has permission to use (either works old enough to be out of copyright or where the creator permits such use), similar to the use of royalty-free materials in larger works. However, I don&#39;t think that a solely AI-generated work, without any human-created content, should be able to be copyrighted.
