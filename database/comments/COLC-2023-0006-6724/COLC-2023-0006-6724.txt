I am an actor whose livelihood is based off of voiceover work (ie: video games, animation, commercial). The actor&rsquo;s union is striking against major studios at the moment in part due to already egregious use of AI without actors&rsquo; consent beginning to take shape in our industry, with only worsening conditions on the horizon. AI in entertainment is not inherently a bad thing, but it&rsquo;s current and intended use seems to by far be heading in a direction of cutting out the human component entirely - destroying jobs and undermining art. It should NOT be a substitute for human performance and leech on human jobs, which will inevitably happen as a result of corporate greed. There needs to be regulation in place for studios to feel limited in how they can exploit this technology. If not for the sake of art, then at least for the preservation of American jobs. I implore you to support the worker, not the corporation, in this matter.
