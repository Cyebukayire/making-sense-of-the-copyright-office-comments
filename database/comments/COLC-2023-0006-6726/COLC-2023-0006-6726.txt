I am significantly concerned by the potential applications of generative AI, particularly in regards to writers, musicians, and artists being able to earn a living. It is clear from recent comments and actions by executives in the entertainment industry that corporations would like to replace skilled artists and writers who must earn a living wage with generative AI where possible, despite the fact that this will have a detrimental impact on the livelihood of artists and on the quality of the material produced. As a software engineer who has studied machine learning and other current forms of AI, the technology is not as mature as widely believed and tends to reflect the biases of the training data provided. The training data often is also gathered without the permission of the original creators, sometimes in clear violation of copyright and licenses such as Creative Commons.<br/><br/>If corporations are allowed to replace skilled artists with generative AI, the consequences will be public misinformation, poor quality art, and the economic destruction of artistry as a way of supporting a living. We would all be left off poorer for it, both economically and in terms of quality of life. This is not to say that there could not be ethical and interesting uses of generative AI and there are some examples of this, but it can only be done if the humans involved are protected and those using the technology properly understand and respect its limitations and shortcomings. My concern is that without governmental regulation, corporations will prioritize short-term profit and shareholder value over the long-term sustainability of creative practices and those who engage in them, to the detriment of us all.
