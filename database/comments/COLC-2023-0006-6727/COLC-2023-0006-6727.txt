I use AI in my writing and it is just a tool. It doesn&#39;t do all the writing because it would be boring and poorly written. It&#39;s not anything but a tool to assist people with their job. Just like a camera can be a tool for an artist that wants to paint a beautiful sunset or a mathematician that uses a calculator. Please take one of the many classes showing how this technology works before making judgements.
