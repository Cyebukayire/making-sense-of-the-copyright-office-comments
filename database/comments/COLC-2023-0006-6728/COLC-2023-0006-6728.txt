Generative AI steals from artists and photographers. The only way you can get an image is by drawing it, photographing it, or photomanipulating images you buy. For photomanipulation, you need to own a license to do that. Generative AI skirts that and creates images &quot;out of nowhere&quot;, but it&#39;s not nowhere, it comes from hardworking artists who spent sometimes years honing their craft and now see their work stolen. AI doesn&#39;t create anything. It&#39;s not something new to add to creativity. <br/>For text, same. If you reference sources, you need to cite them! Otherwise it&#39;s plagiarism. AI is a plagiarism machine, and people are using it and plagiarizing tons of writers who came before them. Not only that, AI is polluting the internet with tons of fake images and poor-quality texts. AI should not be allowed to make money, and in fact, if its source material has not been properly licenses, should not exist. Stealing from millions of artists and writers is still stealing. Just because we can&#39;t pinpoint one source doesn&#39;t mean AI creates its outputs.
