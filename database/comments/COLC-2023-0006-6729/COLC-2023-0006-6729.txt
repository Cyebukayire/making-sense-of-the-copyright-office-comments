Im a professional artist working in the games industry, and I am deeply worried and sickened by the state of ai, specifically generative ai. <br/><br/>The way that these companies have used the lion b data base to effectively steal from and data launder from artists is criminal. The fact that they have targeted illustrators and visual artists who do not have a centralised means of protecting themselves is one example of how cowardly and exploitative they are. Another example is not automatically opting out artists let alone giving them the choice to opt out in the first place.
