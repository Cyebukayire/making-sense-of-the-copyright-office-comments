I do not believe works using generative AI should be given any consideration for copyright protection, especially given that the AI itself may have been trained on copyrighted materials without permission. Copyright exists to protect the author&#39;s or artist&#39;s intellectual creation in their work, and protect them from theft. The &#39;artist&#39; using AI has provided no intellectual creation, merely used prompts to deliver an image much in the same way someone using a search engine would, and they have already committed theft as none of these AI&#39;s specify the sources they were trained on. I doubt you&#39;d award copyright to someone who stole a variety of famous artworks, mashed them together and claimed the result as their own.
