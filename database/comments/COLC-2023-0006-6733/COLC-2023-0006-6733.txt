I believe that in the future AI generated images should be available for copyright for the person who prompted the image. It should be treated similarly to photography, recognizing that the image was not painted or drawn, but it takes knowledge and skill to generate high quality, specific images. It is another medium of artwork, in the way photography is a separate medium from painting/sculpting/cgi rendering, etc.
