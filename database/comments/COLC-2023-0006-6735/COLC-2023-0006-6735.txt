I am a published author and have worked in digital content creation and strategy for many years prior. The rise of AI puts every creative job I&#39;ve ever held at risk of non-existence. <br/><br/>It is essential that the US Copyright office take swift and unwavering action against AI. AI programs are learning at a rapid rate, and they are, for the most part trained on stolen works from scraping across the internet without user consent (see ChatGPT having been trained on Swashwords and AO3 content without consent). Authors and artists have had their copyrighted works uploaded to these programs without their consent so that it can be replicated without their consent. Beyond just emulation, the produced copy and art is being monetized (AI books are across Amazon, and the generators are bragging about their profits (see: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-sell-books-on-amazon-kdp-audible-ai-chatgpt-2023-9), all on the backs of others they are not compensating for their stolen works. <br/><br/>This theft and behavior is having a massive impact on artists and creatives. As an author, I&#39;ve seen droves of my colleagues stop publishing because of the discouragement that comes with this. We were already having piracy issues, and now to have our books stolen in another way, and resold against our will has been too much for many. The artists that we commission for our covers and character art are quitting as well, finding that users are not willing to pay for art creation when an AI bot can producing something instead, ignoring the fact that those bots are trained on the decades of hard work and skill honing of the artists themselves, again without compensation, even while the products of these bots are being sold for profit. This is theft, in and of itself, and it&#39;s rapidly killing an industry. Even beyond the economic devastation of eliminating a creative workforce, it&#39;s removing the empathy and experience from creative works. Our history is catalogued in our art and our writings; by removing people from creative processes, we are setting a dangerous precedence for art and works that can only regurgitate the thoughts and experiences of the generations before. If people stop creating, we stop preserving the human experience. This can have devastating consequences on society, historical records, and our general culture. <br/><br/>Even more dangerous than theft and human erasure, AI is being used to threaten the security of the individual. Voice emulators are being used to replicate a person&#39;s voice, gaining access to banking information and more. Actors are having their likenesses stolen, used  to essentially remove them from employment even as a generated shell of them is used for purposes without their consent. When you can replicate a person&#39;s face, voice, writing style, and artistic talent at the press of a button and a few little phrases, we remove all security of self and expression from the individual. <br/><br/>For all of these reasons, AI needs to be fiercely regulated. It cannot be allowed to be copyrighted when at it&#39;s heart, AI is nothing more than plagiarism and theft. It cannot be allowed to be profitable, as again, it is theft, and there is no way to compensate the original creators under the current models. It cannot be allowed to flourish as it erases people from being people. We need firm regulations and penalizations for using this software, otherwise we will continue to watch creative fields disintegrate into nothing but regurgitated simulation. Please take a firm stance that AI is plagiarism, it&#39;s use for profit is punishable under the law, and that it cannot be legally protected. <br/><br/>
