Although AI is fun as a casual affair, it cannot and should not replace the efforts of actual people. For instance, although I can get the Nightcafe AI to make me a pretty picture, if I want an image of Underverse Frisk wearing the Lamp E.G.O from Lobotomy corporation I need to draw that myself. If I want something abstract I need to draw that myself. AI is a fun novelty, but it isn&#39;t a replacement for people who are honed in their craft, whether as writers, artists, game designers, actors, directors, etc. There need to be regulations so that AI remains a tool for these talented people, rather than a replacement. Otherwise, these industries will suffer from a lack of forethought and innovation.
