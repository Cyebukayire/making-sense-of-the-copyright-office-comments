I own a small business involved in writing and publishing. As it stands now, &quot;AI&quot; -- which is non intelligent generative content created from data stolen from actual human creators -- will irrevocably damage and eventually destroy our industry, degrading the progress of our art. <br/><br/>Most published authors already struggle for visibility and to make a profit. A flood of generated scraped content regurgitated by automated processes further devalues the work of real people. The world doesn&#39;t need pink slime poetry, spewed from datasets of stolen words. Copyright is intended to promote the progress of science and art. But giving protection to &quot;AI&quot; generated content is the opposite of that, devaluing the originating artistic element and eliminating the meaning of creativity itself. <br/><br/>Please, protect real people and real working artists by denying copyright to &quot;AI&quot; non intelligent generative content. Thank you for your time.
