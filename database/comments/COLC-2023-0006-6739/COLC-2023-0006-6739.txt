AI generated content should not be copyright protected because it wasn&rsquo;t made by a human. The current LLMs are based off stolen intellectual property. They were trained on stolen IP with zero compensation to the original copyright holders. Machines and algorithms can not own things. AI generated content threatens the livelihoods and professions of real artists. If AI produced content can be copyright protected then you will see vast layoffs of creators in the writing, movie, artist, and other communities. Please support human artists before corporations looking for easy ways to decrease costs and increase profits at the expense of their employees. You can support artists by continuing to deny copyright protection to AI generated content.
