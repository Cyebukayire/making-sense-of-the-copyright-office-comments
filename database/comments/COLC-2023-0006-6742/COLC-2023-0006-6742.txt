I believe that artificial intelligence in our entertainment is going to take us to very dark places. How much ai should we allow? What percentage will be ok? The gap between 10% and 90% will close almost instantly as the technology improves. We are heavily opening ourselves to unwanted biases that are not made by humans, the ai doesn&rsquo;t pay taxes, and most importantly, it creates a sad future where we are each isolated from each other being entertained by machines. It&rsquo;s not a future I want to be a part of. Visual art, music, film, literature has always been people showing their humanity. If we let ai copy and fake that humanness we are giving something vital and essential of our humanity.
