It is my belief that allowing AI to learn from the work of creatives (writers, artists, etc.) without consent and payment will be detrimental to our collective culture as a whole. The reason why America funds the arts is not to let only the talented thrive, but to allow everyone to participate in the act of creation. From every terrible read of Shakespeare to paintings that know nothing of dimension, these practices allow people to experience growth and joy, with some finding a passion to make it their career. &quot;AI&quot; art/writing does not create. It takes from established work without thought, working within the limits of the prompter. As important as limits are to creatives, they are able to bend them when they see fit. The algorithm cannot, it is only as smart as we make it.<br/><br/>I do not, however, believe AI content creation should be banned. This is not a personal feeling, but an observation. The genie is out of the bottle so to speak, so we cannot stuff it back inside. What I believe should be done is to limit where it can take pieces to generate, and it is only fair that it takes from what everyone else does; the Public Domain.<br/><br/>The Public Domain allows free use of characters, stories, and artwork for anyone to use and profit from. Disney, despite their sordid actions toward the Public Domain, have many of their famous films based on the stories listed in the public domain. If companies using AI-generated content wish to utilize this content without paying the creators of the works they take from, they should be limited to works listed under the Public Domain. Otherwise, companies need to offer a fair and reasonable sum when taking content from others to feed their algorithm. Companies that plan on using the works of their platforms need to be extremely transparent on this. It should be the first thing that pops up in terms and conditions, bolded for emphasis. <br/><br/>As much as I would prefer these AI programs to vanish, they will not. Their existence threatens the creative lifeblood of the United States. Our citizens should be encouraged to pursue passions, not have their passions filled by a prompt. It is not the destination, but the journey within creating, where the piece matters to people individually. <br/><br/>Please, I implore you to regulate the use of artificial intelligence before it is too late and we are creatively cannibalized.
