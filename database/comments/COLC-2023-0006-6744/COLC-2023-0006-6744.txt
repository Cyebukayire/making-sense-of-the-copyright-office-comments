As an artist and a human being, the situation regarding the development of artificial intelligence is something that worries me because, as we are seeing, it is gradually displacing humans from the workplace; the lack of regulations regarding the development and implementation of these technologies are also issues that our governments should consider very seriously, ensuring the well-being of citizens.<br/>I am against the unauthorized use of the work of other artists for Artificial Intelligence training; this is considered plagiarism and seriously affects artists who invest a large part of their time and money in cultivating our skills.
