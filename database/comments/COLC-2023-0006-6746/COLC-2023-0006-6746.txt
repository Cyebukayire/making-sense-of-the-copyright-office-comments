Copyright exists to incentivize creation and reward innovation. Copyrighting machine-generated creations does the opposite. Human creators, who cannot compete with AI&#39;s mass production, can no longer earn a living. It&#39;s their work exploited by AI that is then used to replace them. <br/><br/>Copyrighting AI allows corporate industry to replace the human creator in favor of cheaper, faster, easier machine production. There isn&rsquo;t innovation when human creators leave and what&#39;s produced is only the echo chamber of an AI&#39;s learned data set. <br/><br/>Furthermore, AI doesn&#39;t pay income tax. For every human replaced, the less taxes is generated and more tax money needed to support job loss.<br/><br/>Copyrighting AI works and heavily-dependent AI creations allows for corporate exploitation and harms the individual human creators. If a work can&#39;t be copyrighted, it can be copy and resold by someone else, inherently decreasing it&#39;s value to insustry next to employing human creators. If AI is put on our same level as human creators with copright protection, theb there will be a clear winner. It won&#39;t be humanity. Only the humans who market and sell, not create, will be left.<br/><br/>To prevent copyrighting AI content, regulations or search abilities need to be created to allow checking for AI generation. Images and long chains of text need to be made searchable to the copyright office in AI databases. Or perhaps there needs to be an invisible watermark embedded in text or images that exposes the origin of a work. Something must be enforced to allow detection.<br/><br/>Corporate interests will never favor the individual working person. The government is the only entity that can protect human creators&#39; livelihood and preserve the value of human creativity.
