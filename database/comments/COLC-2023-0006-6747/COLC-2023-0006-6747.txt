My name is Boaz Elad, I&#39;ve been an artist all my life, I almost never used my talent to profit or for business, I mostly used art to express myself and for pleasure! I love the process,<br/>drawing and creating art was always my biggest passion I always used it to introduce myself to the world and also as a form of natural communication with other human beings.<br/>taking this away from me would be like taking away my ability to speak!<br/><br/>On the other hand we humans have always desired to get things done as quickly and cheaply as possible,<br/>this desire brought us into the industrial revolution and into the digital age that we are currently living in, we create machines to do all the dirty, unwanted and repetitive work for us,<br/>so that we can have the time to do the things we like to do.<br/><br/>The problem we have today though, rises with the question of the new AI technologies,<br/>AI just like any other machine can be great for doing repetitive work, calculating, summarizing generating and managing business and products. <br/>AI is indeed revolutionary! and it can change the future of humanity! for the good and for the bad...<br/><br/>however with such a powerful new tool we also need to take precaution and responsibility for this new technology just like we did for many other technologies prior to it,<br/>take the invention of the car for example, imagine we would never have came up with laws to limit it&#39;s use, accidents could go completely wild!<br/>in fact I&#39;m even willing to compare AI to a weapon! yes this technology is that powerful! imagine there would be no laws to limit the use of guns?!<br/>with AI there is literally no limit to what we can achieve!<br/><br/>With all that being said AI needs to be limited to no more then another industrial machine,<br/>and as I&#39;ve mentioned before industrial machines are designed to make our hard labor easier, but is art really a hard and tedious work that we want to get rid of it&#39;s traditional process?<br/>For many artists, their skills and talents are also a source (if not the only source) of income that they have, but even far more then that,<br/>art is also their natural source of expression and passion! the source of their free will and imagination! no real artist would ever tell you that they hate drawing! you cannot take this away from us,<br/>it&#39;s in our blood! therefore, taking this passion and industrializing it would be a horrible mistake for our culture! depressing and depraving people from doing what gives them purpose!<br/>because what makes our craft so special is the journey! the process! NOT the end result! our craft is not a product! it&#39;s part of our soul and passion! we love CREATING it! not producing it.<br/><br/>There&#39;s also another Issue with AI and that&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s current way of working is that it literally scrapes and steals our precious creations in order to mass produce new ones of it&#39;s own...<br/>As mentioned already an artist&#39;s craft is part of his soul! part if his identity, stealing an artist&#39;s art style and passion would literally count as identity theft! it could potentially leave him menially devastated!<br/>how much so would it be if you would find a way to industrialize this kind of theft? the consequences would be unimaginably bad to the point of no repair! that&#39;s exactly the case with AI.<br/>And no AI does not get &quot;inspired&quot;, it copies and endlessly repeats the process just like any other machine, it&#39;s simply not a fair game, businesswise and mentally.<br/><br/>There&#39;s also those who argue &quot;thanks to AI, art is now democratized and free for all! everyone can be an artist now!&quot;<br/>I say NO! on the opposite! AI steals ideas and mixes them all together making it impossible for anyone to freely express themselves!<br/>the passion and the process are not the same and there is no way of giving credit to anyone! it&#39;s just a way to mass produce &quot;art&quot; which was never meant to be industrialized in the first place.<br/>Traditional art was already naturally democratized! we don&#39;t need a generating machine for everyone to be an artist! art is within our human nature,<br/>everyone can become an artist with enough practice and dedication, and the satisfaction of it would be far more real and rewarding! no matter how &quot;good&quot; you are at it.<br/><br/>So please, in honor of humanity and for the sake of our passion and love for what we artists are all doing, we have to make the right decision now! since this technology is developing rapidly and fast!<br/>please make the right choice and limit this machine, please give us the right for our passion and suppress the use of AI, so it has to follow moral standards and values and respect human made art,<br/>so that we can all create art without the fear of someone stealing our rights for our passion and credit.<br/><br/>thank you.
