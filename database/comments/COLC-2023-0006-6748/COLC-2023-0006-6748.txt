I believe generative AI is not only fundamentally unable to by copyrighted, most applications involve a violation of other&#39;s copyrights. &quot;AI,&quot; consisting of amalgamations of data, ultimately is simply a composited collage of collected, or outright stolen, works made by people who were not involved in the AI&#39;s creation. These data sets are so vast that, even if one claims to have permission or own the copyright to all images or text used by the AI, that claim is essentially unverifiable for any practical examination. Essentially, even one says their AI did not steal anyone&#39;s work, no one has the capability to effectively prove that statement. It is in the best interest, both for hard working artists and the efficacy of the Copyright Office, to assume that an AI composited work has taken and used art (image-based or textual) from an artist without that artist&#39;s explicit knowledge or consent. Therefore, a copyrighted AI work would near-inevitably be violating the copyright of someone else.
