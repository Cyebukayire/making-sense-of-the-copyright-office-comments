My current views on the concept of A.I are mixed. On the hand of creating a sapient &amp; sentient A.I which would be capable of human levels of intelligence, I find the concept fascinating and believe that the government and private sector should focus on these improvements, whether that means that A.I should also be crossed with improvements in robotics and neuroscience. <br/><br/>However.<br/><br/>The current A.I is by no means something I look forward to. America is built on the backs of creatives, from every special building we have to the clothing we wear to the interiors we walk into, and the shows we watch. The books we read. The art showing our glory. The flag itself was created through minds not A.I, and it is an upsetting thing knowing that people are losing their jobs and their livelihoods, their passions and what makes them, them, to what accounts to be a device which is trained, without the permission atop of that, of other people&rsquo;s hard work, sweat, tears, blood, and strife. It takes very little to truly make things with A.I, simply putting in parameters and making a prompt you can come out with soulless art and writing, effectively ruining what another made. <br/><br/>I do not believe that people should be able to earn any money from A.I, nor do I believe it should at all have any copyright. I believe A.I should stay solely in fields with proper interest such as medicine or creating better technology. It should stay away from the creative field, the soul of America, the soul of Humanity, and the Soul of Earth.<br/><br/>I do not like, nor do I approve of A.I in the way it is used and I hope that proper change can be made. Thank you for taking the time out and reading this comment, and may you have a blessed day.
