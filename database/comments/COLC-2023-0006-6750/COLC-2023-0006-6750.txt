There must be a separation between AI-generated images and images captured with digital cameras to ensure the legitimacy of images. For images generated via AI, one must ask, &quot;Who is the owner of the image&quot; Is it the person who created it or the AI engine that created it? Understand images created via AI are computer-generated images that do not have an &quot;owner&quot;, because the generated image IS NOT a creation of the author, but rather what the computer generates.  There must be a mechanism developed that can track AI-generated images vs in-camera-generated images. Currently, Reuters/Canon have developed a &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; method to identify AI-generated images through metadata tracking. Without safeguards for the photographic creations done by photographers, AI-generated pictures will be commonplace and disrupt an entire industry of dedicated professionals. Copyright must address each genre and develop a method to 1)protect and 2)preserve the originality of digital works of art.
