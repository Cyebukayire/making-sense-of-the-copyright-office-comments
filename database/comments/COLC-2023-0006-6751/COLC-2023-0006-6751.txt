I strongly believe that, when regulating new technologies with the potential to have large and meaningful impacts on society, preference should be given to upholding the rights and benefits of those struggling over the rights and benefits of businesses and corporations that have the power and privilege of exploiting those materials to their own ends.<br/>The government&#39;s role in regulating technology that can drastically change labor, privacy, and art, should not be one that favors a vague ambition of &quot;innovation&quot; over one that favors the stability and sustainability of those who have already been struggling in a system increasingly designed to leave people at the bottom of the pyramid.
