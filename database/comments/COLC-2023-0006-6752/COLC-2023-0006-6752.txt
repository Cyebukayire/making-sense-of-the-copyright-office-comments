AI image and media generation is blatant theft that disregards and actively harms the livelihoods of the original creators of the media stolen and misappropriated without compensation or consent. It is immoral, legally dubious, and should be banned in all its forms; if not that, then at MINIMUM it must be heavily regulated so that real creators and their livelihoods are not harmed and put at risk by thieves using AI media generation and stealing their work. In short: BAN IT. If it can&#39;t be fully banned, HEAVILY REGULATE IT.
