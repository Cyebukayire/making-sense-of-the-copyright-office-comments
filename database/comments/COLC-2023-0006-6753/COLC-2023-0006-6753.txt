Any work constructed by AI should remain public domain and be ineligible to hold a copyright. This does not include works using individual tools such as spell/grammar check or specific design tools. Included uses would be generating in part or full: concepts, drafts, film, audio, or imagery. Whether they are altered after generation is moot as their base point is made from a tool using stolen work. Every day there are articles, clips, posts, etc showing artists dead and alive being stolen from. It has been made blatantly obvious that the training materials were already under copyright and by allowing a copyright of generative AI works, the US Copyright Office is taking a stance that a copyright means nothing. If AI is allowed to hold a copyright then that copyright and every other copyright is by definition invalidated. AI is a useful but dangerous tool without any regulation. Firm boundaries need to be set and upheld and this starts with the copyright. Please do not allow protection on works of others who protection is being taken away to create these new works.
