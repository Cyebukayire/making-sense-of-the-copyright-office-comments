I&#39;m a unionized concept artist and an independent author, and I strongly believe the only ethical path forward is to quickly develop protections and regulations in regards to AI-generated information gathering processes and outcomes. <br/><br/>AI data collection has been opaque from the beginning, with many months of scraping data from copyright-protected sources before public announcement. It crawls across websites, including portfolios, studios, galleries, museum archives, research databases with pay walls, and many more. This in particular is an atrocious abuse of copyright law in any other circumstance, and should be address with strict, certain terms. It&#39;s not just a question of who owns rights to an image, likeness, or words. It is also a question of privacy, creative/innovative security, and personal agency.
