The world is headed toward AI being in far more things than it is now. But what we must remember is that most everything in the world is inspired from something else. The main problem with AI is it can&#39;t differentiate between inspiring and plagerism. It shouldn&#39;t be able to lift, word for word, a story that someone else wrote and give it to another person as if it generated it and didn&#39;t straight up copy it. In my opinion, artificial intelligence is a downward spiral to a greater issue emerging where people, especially those who struggle to invent or be creative, will only be useful for physical or menial tasks. The desire to create only to have your work be stolen is crushing. But laws and regulations can&#39;t change that. The only thing you could do is try to ban ai, but we all know that isn&#39;t happening, so I think this is a moot point. We are headed toward ai taking over and no amount of regulation will stop the people at the top from having ai even if it&#39;s banned for us normal folk.
