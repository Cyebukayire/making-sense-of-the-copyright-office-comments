My name is Yasmine, I&#39;m 29 years old, I have been drawing since childhood, I have always loved to draw, throughout my life I have always been called the painter and the artist, it took me many years to reach a high level, quality art is not learned in one day, it takes hours upon hours and years of investment. I cannot describe the Passion and the satisfying feeling that I finally finished a painting after many hours or days or even months, something that is uniquely mine.<br/><br/> Since the Ai came out something in me has shut down, I no longer have the desire to draw like before, because the computer can already do it better than me in just a second, it makes me depressed and my heart cries, it takes away from me the love and passion that I had all my life, and takes all these years I acquired on my own into such a cheap thing with no personality or soul, without any appreciation or respect<br/><br/>The consequences of Ai will lead to generations of people who cannot imagine for themselves, who do not know how to express themselves with creativity, and will destroy the culture of art,<br/><br/> Please remove Ai from the world, this world will no longer be a place that gives room to develop deep thought and creativity, and you have the power to change that.
