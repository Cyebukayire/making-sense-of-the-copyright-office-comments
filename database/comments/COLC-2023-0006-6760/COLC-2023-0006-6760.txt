AI art is made from the hardwork of talented individuals that make theur livelihood from drawing. AI steals from artists without their knowledge and permission using their copyrighted work to create something. However AI does noy create, it takes from other work and just takes bits of pieces to make a Frankenstein piece. AI steals from artist who make their money from their work. Its how they afford their homes their meals. Allowing AI art is a slap to the face to every individual who spent their life creating and making art. There is no ethical way to allow AI art because it can not create it only takes from others work and gives nothing back. Everyone can learn to draw if they put in the time or effort.
