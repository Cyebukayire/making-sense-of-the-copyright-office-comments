I think that AI generated works should only be copyrightable if they were generated from training material that was either wholly owned by the content creator, or legally free use, not content scalped randomly from the internet or obtained illegally. I also think that work that was generated and then manipulated by a person beyond a certain percentage (using the same percentages for legally creating work based off of someone else&#39;s work) should be considered as if the person doing the manipulation was making composites or fan work instead of wholesale created work. This opens up tools that allow an artist to create AI generated art trained in only their own work, and for people to create works from open source work, that they can alter to make new works with that aren&#39;t just mass produced and pumped out by the computer.<br/><br/>I do think that if AI is used to directly emulate someone, their works, or their style, and was trained on their likeness, their works, or their style, so that someone could generate content based on them or their works, without actually paying them for it, then this is the same as intellectual property theft, and should be considered as such.<br/><br/>I also think that if any kind of copyright allowances for AI is made, then what must also be included is access to the training material. I don&#39;t think any AI made content should be allowed unless they can verify that all the training material was fairly sourced and that all parties had their content used with knowledge and consent and or compensation for that project.
