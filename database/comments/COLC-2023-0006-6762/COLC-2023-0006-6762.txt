As both an artist and writer. I do see were a lot of people who do not support Ai in copyrighted works  comes from but also from some one who uses Ai Art generator and has had Ai help with an upcoming project.  I personal think there is a balance that can be found,   Ai Art of already copyrighted characters  should not be able to get any protection,  and the use of some one elses voice is also something that should not get protection,   But original new art should have some protection   but not full protection   if its used in a collection such as a Book, Game, or other kind of work  then  it should have protection  and if the stand alone is used to damage the collection then there should be some kind of protection for the collection.   But again I think we can find a balance
