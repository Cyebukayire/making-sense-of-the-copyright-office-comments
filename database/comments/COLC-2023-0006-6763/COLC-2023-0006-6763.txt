As a self-published author, I am not comfortable with AI having the ability to use my intellectual property for any reason. I am not comfortable with the possibility of AI generated literature having the ability to penetrate the literary market, thus affording it the ability to force authors like myself out of jobs. Alternatively, I do see how AI can be a tool for creating marketing copy, but I do believe that all works that are deemed creative, should remain created by humans and inspired by the human experience behind them.
