I am a digital artist, the owner of my intellectual property. AI art ignores this, successfully stealing my work for programs such as TikTok AI art filters, AI &quot;art generators&quot;, and risks being used in deepfakes. This is in no way fair use, nor is it in accordance to artwork copyright. On a moral scale, this puts countless artists at risk of losing work, and losing their livelihood. AI &quot;art&quot; is a form of theft and plagiarism that IP laws should definitely redefine to protect artists of all forms from falling victim to these &quot;art generators&quot;.
