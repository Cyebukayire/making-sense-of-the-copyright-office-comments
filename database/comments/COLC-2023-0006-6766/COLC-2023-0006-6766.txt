Q1. I&#39;m not against use of AI in generating works, whether they be text, visuals, or other media, but how does the author ensure that the output doesn&#39;t infringe on another&#39;s copyright? I&#39;m not sure they can. If an author uses the world around them as input, it&#39;s open to their interpretation of it. It&#39;s subjective. It&#39;s personal. If an AI generates content, is that content given only to one author? I doubt it. It&#39;s not personal. It&#39;s data output by a system. I believe works generated by AI have to be identified as such, separate from non-AI works. What&#39;s to stop someone from prompting - write me a book using a famous author&#39;s work as a guideline? Or write me a fantasy like this book? <br/>Q2. If I see another author&#39;s work similar to mine, I can take them to court to determine the degree of similarity and if they infringed on copyright. How do you do that for AI? What if they use a prompt to say I want my books to be similar to x author? My tone of voice is just as unique to my stories as the plot, characters, dialog and other variables. <br/>Q4. I do think this needs to be an international approach. Other countries often use more stringent privacy laws to protect their people than the US. And some countries don&#39;t recognize any of our copyrights. We have zero protections against them except in countries like the US, or EU, etc. Given that most of our revenue is generated in US, EU, etc. I look to those countries to have a unified approach to identifying and copyrighting non-AI and AI-driven works.<br/>5. Yes, new legislation is warranted. My view is simple compared to all of the complex viewpoints on this massive discussion. I simply want AI works identified separately from 100 percent authored works. I see the need for both types of works, but I think the legal governing the production of the works differs widely and therefore, the works should have different degrees of protection. <br/>Thank you for allowing this simple author the chance to comment.
