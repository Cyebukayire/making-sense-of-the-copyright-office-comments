Tech writer Mike Thomas described the following dangers that concern me: <br/><br/>LACK OF AI TRANSPARENCY AND EXPLAINABILITY <br/>AI and deep learning models can be difficult to understand, even for those that work directly with the technology. This leads to a lack of transparency for how and why AI comes to its conclusions, creating a lack of explanation for what data AI algorithms use, or why they may make biased or unsafe decisions. <br/><br/>JOB LOSSES DUE TO AI AUTOMATION<br/>Goldman Sachs even states 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to AI automation.<br/><br/>SOCIAL MANIPULATION THROUGH AI ALGORITHMS<br/>Online media and news have become even murkier in light of AI-generated images and videos, AI voice changers as well as deepfakes infiltrating political and social spheres. These technologies make it easy to create realistic photos, videos, audio clips or replace the image of one figure with another in an existing picture or video. As a result, bad actors have another avenue for sharing misinformation and war propaganda, creating a nightmare scenario where it can be nearly impossible to distinguish between creditable and faulty news. <br/><br/>&ldquo;No one knows what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s not &hellip;.So it really leads to a situation where you literally cannot believe your own eyes and ears; you can&rsquo;t rely on what, historically, we&rsquo;ve considered to be the best possible evidence... <br/><br/>SOCIAL SURVEILLANCE <br/>A prime example is China&rsquo;s use of facial recognition technology in offices, schools and other venues. Besides tracking a person&rsquo;s movements, the Chinese government may be able to gather enough data to monitor a person&rsquo;s activities, relationships and political views.  <br/><br/>SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITY <br/>If companies refuse to acknowledge the inherent biases baked into AI algorithms, they may compromise their DEI initiatives through AI-powered recruiting. The idea that AI can measure the traits of a candidate through facial and voice analyses is still tainted by racial biases, reproducing the same discriminatory hiring practices businesses claim to be eliminating.  <br/><br/>WEAKENING ETHICS AND GOODWILL<br/>Pope Francis warned against AI&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;circulate tendentious opinions and false data&rdquo; and stressed the far-reaching consequences of letting this technology develop without proper oversight or restraint.<br/>The rapid rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard gives these concerns more substance. Many users have applied the technology to get out of writing assignments, threatening academic integrity and creativity.<br/><br/>FINANCIAL CRISES BROUGHT ABOUT BY AI ALGORITHMS  <br/>The financial industry has become more receptive to AI technology&rsquo;s involvement in everyday finance and trading processes. As a result, algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets.<br/> <br/> LOSS OF HUMAN INFLUENCE<br/>Using AI in healthcare could result in reduced human empathy and reasoning, for instance. And applying generative AI for creative endeavors could diminish human creativity and emotional expression. Interacting with AI systems too much could even cause reduced peer communication and social skills.
