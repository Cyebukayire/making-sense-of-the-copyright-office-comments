AI-written books should NOT be copyrightable. The simple reason: books that ALREADY have copyright protection have been used to train the system. 170,000 books.<br/><br/>&quot;Upwards of 170,000 books, the majority published in the past 20 years, are in LLaMA&rsquo;s training data. In addition to work by Silverman, Kadrey, and Golden, nonfiction by Michael Pollan, Rebecca Solnit, and Jon Krakauer is being used, as are thrillers by James Patterson and Stephen King and other fiction by George Saunders, Zadie Smith, and Junot D&iacute;az. These books are part of a dataset called &#39;Books3,&#39; and its use has not been limited to LLaMA. Books3 was also used to train Bloomberg&rsquo;s BloombergGPT, EleutherAI&rsquo;s GPT-J&mdash;a popular open-source model&mdash;and likely other generative-AI programs now embedded in websites across the internet.&quot; (Alex Reisner, The Atlantic, August 19, 2023, https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/books3-ai-meta-llama-pirated-books/675063/ )<br/><br/>It&#39;s one thing for a human to read books and be inspired to write their own work (not including plagiarism). It&#39;s quite another to have a machine pull from more books than a human could ever read in a lifetime, and create works from it. Those works should not be copyrightable.
