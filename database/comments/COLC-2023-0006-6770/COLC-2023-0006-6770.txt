I want to thank the Office for allowing the public to weigh in on this very serious topic. It&#39;s absolutely not something that should be decided by a few wealthy and powerful tech companies.<br/><br/>I am both a writer who posts my work online for the enjoyment of readers and a supporter of other writers and artists. I value the arts as the invaluable part of our cultural heritage they are. <br/><br/>Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution. While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.  To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.<br/><br/>These violations are both legal and moral.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>There is also much to be considered about this alleged &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; being used by large companies to replace the work and creativity of actual human artists, enabling them to stop paying actual human beings and instead &quot;create content&quot; based on the work of writers and artists whose rights are being violated, whose consent is not given, and who are not being paid. <br/><br/>Thank you again for your thoughtful consideration of this topic. I hope you will make the right decision.
