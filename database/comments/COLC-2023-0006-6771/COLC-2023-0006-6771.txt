   AI absolutely has to be regulated. It is already being used to exploit artists by making copies of their voices, art, and labor in order to produce films, video games, and TV shows without having to pay these people. Artists work very hard to perfect their art. Non-artists seem to think that because art can be enjoyable, that it is not hard work and does not deserve a living wage. As an artist, I can say that this is so far from the truth. Art is a labor of love, but it is labor all the same and requires tons of hard mental and physical work. Not to mention, AI is also already taking from works that have been posted online, essentially stealing art to put it through an algorithm to regurgitate images that are just an amalgamation of those stolen images that it uses without consent from the artists. People have already been using this to maliciously copy the art of specific artists to argue that they can now make art just like that so that artist no longer has value. But without that artist, the AI &quot;art&quot; wouldn&#39;t even be able to exist. Artists already are overworked and underpaid, and this new tool is already being used to make that problem even worse, forcing artists out of work and into dangerous living situations. As a society, we value art, but we do not value the people who make it, and I do not want to see what happens when that situation gets even worse. AI can be used as a tool that works along with artists in some ways, like cutting down on certain tedious tasks, but it is a very dangerous tool that can be and already has been used for major exploitation. It needs to be regulated so that it cannot be used to steal from artists, whether that art is visual images, animation, voice acting, writing, or music.
