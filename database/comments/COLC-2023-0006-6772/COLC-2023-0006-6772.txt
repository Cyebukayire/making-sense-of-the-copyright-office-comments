I am a working writer and filmmaker. Among the feature films I have written and directed is Repo Man (Universal Pictures, 1983). Thanks to US copyright law, 35 years after the release of the film I was able to recapture the US rights to the screenplay, including all sequels and remakes. So, unlike many authors who surrender their rights to the studio, I am the copyright owner of my own material. <br/><br/>In May of this year I asked a friend at the University of Colorado to use an AI system to get an idea of to what extent my copyright material has been &quot;scraped&quot; from the internet. He asked ChatGPT 4, which is owned by Open AI, to come up with a screenplay outline titled Repo Man on Mars. The result was several pages of written material, all of it derived from my original Repo Man screenplay. The scenes were the same. The plot was the same. Individual sequences and suggested speeches were the same. Even the character names were the same.<br/><br/>All of these are breaches of my copyright. In the non-virtual world, no writer or producer is legally able to prepare an outline or screenplay based on another person&#39;s copyright, for commerical purposes. Yet in the virtual world, AI companies have boasted about &quot;scraping&quot; the internet, so as to &quot;educate&quot; the AI systems which they have created for commercial gain. This use of my copyright material is not &quot;fair use&quot;. Open AI is a multi-billion dollar commercial enterprise, 49% of which is owned by Microsoft. The other owners are wealthy oligarchs including Elon Musk.<br/><br/>This &quot;scraping&quot; of copyright material from the internet is against the law. Yet the law is not being enforced. As a result, the Writers Guild of America is currently on strike against the big studios and streaming companies, in order to defend the status of writers. If Microsoft, Musk, and OpenAI are allowed to practice massive copyright theft, if the studios and streaming companies are able to starve the writers out, the position of a creative writer will be destroyed. Writers will be reduced to copyright spotters, helping the studios and streaming companies reap greater profits, by removing obvious copyright violations from AI-created outlines, synopses, and screenplays.<br/><br/>OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies must be made to pay massively for their copyright breaches to date. All copyright material must be removed from their data bases. Until this is done - and seen to be done - no AI-generated material should receive copyright protection, as it is currently the product of large-scale copyright theft.
