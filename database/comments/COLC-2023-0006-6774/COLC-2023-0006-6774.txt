I am deeply concerned about the use of AI by corporations and other monied interests, especially in industries where it will take jobs away from humans who need them and allow companies or individuals to pay less in salaries while instead lining their pockets. I do not want to live in a world with AI art, television, or movies. I continue to value the contributions of creatives even if corporations would rather stop paying them so they can pass that money along to their shareholders. We already live in a country where the needs of a few monied people are prioritized over the needs of the many and AI is already exacerbating that. I encourage you to curtail the allowed uses of AI in the interest of humans. Thank you.
