Any item that has been presented for the public to see or has been legally obtained, should be able to be used for Ai training.  If a creator does not want work derived from their work, they should keep their creations out of the public eye.  No creator  creates in a vacuum, all works are derived from other works. Every artist, writer, musician, actor, engineer, dancer, etc. derives their work from other works they are exposed to; This is true for humans and artificial intelligence.  Learning from others should not be restricted.<br/><br/>    Copyright should handled the same as any work that is created using a tool that makes creation easier.
