I believe that AI is a useful tool that needs to be carefully regulated. I believe that AI should have strict laws governing what can and cannot be used to train it, and that any content created by AI that was trained on anything except what belongs to an institution should not be copyrightable by that institution. For example, if Disney had an AI help with animation, that AI should only be trained on work that Disney SOLEY owns. If it is trained on anything else, the work it produces should not be copyrightable. I also believe that artists, writers, and other such workers should be fully informed of what of their work could be fed into such an AI model, and either have the option to opt out or, at the very least, to be fully, 100% aware of the implications of such before taking a job with that entity. Lastly, I believe that using AI to replicate real individuals, whether that be the faces, voices, bodies or other forms of identity in an audio, photo, or video media should be illegal without consent, as a form of identity theft, libel/slander, or copyright infringement of an individual&#39;s right to their own face and brand, in order to protect both the livelihoods and reputations of both celebrities and your average individual.
