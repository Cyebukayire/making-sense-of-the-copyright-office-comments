As the founder of an award-winning video game studio, I have a large body of concerns revolving around intellectual property rights as they pertain to generative AI models. And before I outline those points, I would also like to stress that the bulk of these concerns are held by practically every professional artist and creator I know, particularly those who own their own intellectual property.<br/><br/>1. Generative models are not true artificial intelligence &mdash; they are probability based algorithms &mdash; and by extension, the work they perform is incapable of being transformative.<br/>2. Generative AI models rely on mass amounts of training data obtained without consent, and without the opportunity for artists to opt or, or, in cases where they would opt in, without any mechanism to compensate said artists for the use of their labor. The most mainstream models, including Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, have scraped most images from the internet as part of their training data without consent.<br/>3. Though proponents of AI Gen models will argue that diffusion-type algorithms generate unique images, repeated examples of generated images veering remarkably close to training data&mdash;including artifacts the retain part of an artist&rsquo;s signature&mdash;show that this is not the case.<br/>4. The human-level input on AI Gen image and text generation is minimal &mdash; it is a series of single word or short phrase prompts that spit out dozens of images. If we agree, for instance, that by default, the intellectual property rights for a commissioned piece of art belong to the artist rather than the commissioner, there is no reason to believe that using an AI-gen model is any more transformative than providing a description to a human artist, aside from the fact that the AI&rsquo;s work itself is not transformative.<br/>5. Since nothing transformative takes place, and since the model relies on billions of points of data without the license to use it, I believe that beyond not being copyright-able, all AI art generated by those algorithms is infringing on some level.<br/><br/>I don&rsquo;t have copyright related concerns with AI-gen models where the user owns a license for all of that model&rsquo;s training data, but given the massive scope of data necessary for a model to function, I find it hard to believe that those hypothetical models would be functional.<br/><br/>I have a number of other issues that extend beyond copyright implications, but given the focus of your office, I will hold those concerns for this comment. The negative implications of these tools in terms of disrupting the labor market and negatively affecting the arts, however, is astronomical.<br/><br/>I can also say that has someone who travels in the professional circles of artists and other creators, my concerns are ubiquitous across that section of the economy. Absolutely nobody, aside from self proclaimed &ldquo;disruptors&rdquo; has a favorable view of artificial intelligence on the arts, and all share concerns around their work being used without their consent on an industrial scale to try and replace them.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my comment,<br/>Tony Howard-Arias (President, Black Tabby Games)
