It should be considered copyright infringement to use someone else&#39;s work to train an AI to produce products based on such works without permission. The biggest problem right now is that artists, writers, musicians, etc. all have to burden themselves with taking extra steps to prevent artistic work from being used to train AI models when it is the people who are training AI models who should be the ones required to take extra steps to ensure they are using data that has been approved for such use. The laws of an AI &quot;using something&quot; should be equivalent to if a real person were to do the same, and the person/organization creating the AI needs to be held legally responsible for everything and anything that AI produces.<br/><br/>Allowing AI to exist and operate under current broad and fuzzy copyright legalities only perpetuates negligent usage of said AI. If a person is telling an AI to train off of a set of data, that person needs to be held 100% responsible for everything that AI does with that data. If AI is training AI, then development needs to be traced back to the first human person within the chain and they should be culpable. Using art to train AI without the artist&#39;s consent absolutely needs to be considered copyright infringement.<br/><br/>Art should be protected. Art is art because it&#39;s made by humans. Art is a human experience. Art is valuable because of the people who make it, not the machines. Art museums exist to showcase the historical work of artists - the Louvre would not be the same should it be filled with &quot;art&quot; created by algorithms. The way AI is regulated going forward will have huge lasting impacts on humanity and the technological landscape; do not take this lightly.
