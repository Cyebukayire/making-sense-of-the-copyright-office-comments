With the arrival of AI technology it would be wrong if creative professionals are not  protected from having their work plagiarised by an algorithm and then used by others for commercial gain. This would have the effect of undermining  the dynamism of the creative industries upon which a large element of economic vitality depends. It is my view that consideration should be given to copyright law reform in response to this changing landscape. It would be very wrong in my view both ethically and economically for copyright to be afforded to individuals for creative works which they have not been responsible for and which have been created by an algorithm derived from the work of others. We have laws against plagiarism, forgery and appropriation so surely laws surrounding the use for commercial gain of works derived from this new technology should reflect that.
