As an independent author I come from the view of one who knows how much work and time it takes for a human to compose and collect thoughts, refine them and put them out to the world. I also value the skills that it takes for those who create my covers and I have to say that I feel that regardless of human involvement, if the base product is generated by AI no copyright should be issues.<br/>I Also understand that policing this will be difficult and space for comment here limited. So, I will just say in gist, if caught claiming AI content as anything but should be meet with the forfeiture of all copyrighted material held by said individual or company. Make the penalty such that it is not worth the risk.<br/>
