AI has great potential to be helpful for so many other things but for content creation it is nothing but a legal nightmare.  AI being used for creative purposes has been trained illegally off of scraped data and images that the creators did not consent for to be used in this manner.  Unless forced to shut down, wipe, and retrain, all current AI engines used for creative purposes must be shut down permanently and not allowed to copyright any images generated.  I&#39;ve personally been AI scraped and it is such a disgusting feeling knowing I didn&#39;t consent for my illustration to be used for AI generation and there&#39;s nothing I can do about it.  At this stage, every image or creative piece generated by AI can not be allowed to copyright said image/piece since it&#39;s built on a stolen foundation.
