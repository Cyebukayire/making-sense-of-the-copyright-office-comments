I am a small author with a catalog of about 20 books under different pen names. I earn less than $10k per year from my writing. In the five years I&#39;ve been publishing, I have encountered many challenges in my career, from Amazon&#39;s near-monopoly on ebook sales in the U.S. to pirated (stolen copies) of my books appearing on websites without my permission. But having my work taken from me, without my knowledge or consent, to be fed into a giant algorithm at for-profit companies, is a challenge I do not know how to overcome. I cannot opt out from entities that require me to check a box coercing my &quot;permission&quot; when I depend upon such entities for distribution. I cannot compete with the people who use LLMs/generative artificial intelligence to &quot;create&quot; what might charitably be called &quot;books&quot; and flood the market with unreadable garbage. This turns off readers who can choose to do anything else with their time: watch TV, play video games, listen to music, etc. Except that television scripts written by AI are, inevitably, going to be the same unintelligible dreck currently clogging up Amazon&#39;s ebook sales. I am but one small author. If the U.S. Copyright Office permits content written by A.I. to receive copyright protection, it will be undoing its own legacy. It will undermine thousands of small authors who may yet be the next Colleen Hoover or Rebecca Yarros (the author of Fourth Wing), but in the meantime depend upon those sales to send our children to camp, pay for extracurricular activities, or bridge the gap between a paycheck and the end of the month. We will give up. *I* will give up, if forced to compete with an AI onslaught. The creative economy accounts for billions of dollars&#39; worth of economic activity - just look at Taylor Swift and Beyonce&#39;s tours. Our imagination and hard work should not be ripped off and exploited by well-funded for-profit companies without fair compensation - and the results of such so-called &quot;transformative&quot; work should not be eligible for copyright protection.
