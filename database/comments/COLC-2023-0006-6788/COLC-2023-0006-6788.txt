Artificial Intelligence is misleading in name. They are man made algorithms made by people that steal and gather data from other creators. AI generated art or writing of any kind should not be allowed to hold any legal copywrite because the ideas made by artificial intelligence are not original content. It&rsquo;s cobbled together by stolen work. Much of the work that has been trained in mid journey for example is stolen from already trademarked or copy written materials. The original artists did not give consent and were not given compensation. The vast majority of the art and writing community is rallied against AI because it devalues and circumvents input and creations by real, human individuals.
