Hello. As a young American Citizen, the idea of AI works being able to be copy-written is concerning. Artificial Intelligence is a misnomer, though an impressive program, it does not produce original works and thus cannot claim it as its own. AI, such as in its nature, can only echo human creativity and to train it, all images and texts it is trained with should be consenting to the use of their works, or their works are in free use laws. However, the use of voices in any work that has the ability of making money should not be allowed as it not only takes jobs from actors and voice actors, but also undermines laborers work and should not be allowed in any capacity. I believe the ability for AI works to be protected under copyright law is an injustice to humanity itself and that creatives must be protected from any copyright infringement via AI using their writing, arts, photos, and voices in any capacity that has not been explicitly consented to.
