Essentially I think we should outlaw AI in all but except the most unusual situations where it has a track record of potential benefit and low extremely potential for harm. There seems to be very few situations that meet this test, and creative pursuits are not among them. Allowing AI to &quot;generate&quot; creative works based on human artistic works is so harmful to artists, and spoils the value of what our artists give to us. We simply should not allow it.
