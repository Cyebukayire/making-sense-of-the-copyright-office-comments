I&#39;m a Voice Actor for games, animation and dubbing. To date, I&#39;ve found AI replicas of characters I&#39;ve voiced on at least 5 sites. These sites scrape my voice from past work, then use an AI to simulate my voice, without compensation, to say anything that people on the Internet type in. This not only is without consent and compensation, but I believe it may violate copyright laws. Two additional challenges: finding sites that use my voice (there are more every day and they often don&#39;t list my name, only the character), and getting sites to remove AI content once it&#39;s found. All of these sites, along with contracts allowing companies hiring Voice Actors to freely use their voices on future projects, often with no compensation, is creating a situation that is eroding the industry.
