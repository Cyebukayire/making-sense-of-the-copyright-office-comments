My comments, as an individual artist who uses the technology, are regarding the domain of Art vs Generative AI. See PDF included. And I would highly suggest you to watch the very informative series entitled &quot;&quot;Everything is a Remix&quot; video series (the last and final episode is dedicated to AI) which I believe is a great eye opener for anyone not aware of what is the creative process is in all of its forms. It has a clear and easy explanatory approach for anyone to understand.<br/>EP4: Everything is a Remix AI:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rswxcDyotXA<br/>Other episodes:<br/>EP 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ2GuvUWaP8<br/>EP 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhMar_eYnNY<br/>EP 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwxtW1Aio68&quot;. <br/><br/>Thanks for your time.
