&quot;AI&quot; is a scam. It&#39;s simply fancy branding for LLM and the fact that corporations are using them to scrape the web of written and image content in order to train their models without the creators&#39; express consent is ridiculous. Giant corporations only want to automate things using &quot;AI&quot; in order to suppress wages and put people out of jobs. As an author and content creator I do not support anything that so blatantly flouts copyright law and steals my work with no recourse for me. We need to legislate these Large Language Models and &quot;Generative AI&quot; to protect workers and creatives.
