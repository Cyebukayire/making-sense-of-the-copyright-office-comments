AI generated art is currently generated by sampling artist&rsquo;s work without their permission, and without paying royalties. This is an infringement on artist&rsquo;s rights.<br/>Furthermore, AI has the capability of generating unlimited content that may be similar or a near replicate of artist&rsquo;s work. If AI work can be copyrighted, we will see an issue unfathomably worse than the current issue of patent trolls. There will be businesses created around making libraries of random content and then filing lawsuits claiming similarities and infringements. It will render future copyrights almost useless.
