AI does not request nor receive authorization before directly scraping and using copyrighted material. This is wrong and unjust. It completely circumvents any established copyright laws to the detriment of the copyright holders. AI needs to be held accountable to copyright laws and it also needs to clearly define and detail the means and mechanics used to search sources and pull information. This basic requirement will help prevent copyright violations and allow for claims to be made if a violation has occurred.
