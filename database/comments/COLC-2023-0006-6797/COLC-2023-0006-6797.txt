I don&rsquo;t believe AI content should be copyrighted. Ultimately any work compiled by AI is a select composition of data collected from other copyrighted sources. Also any AI work is not expressed from a human, so the AI itself would need to apply for copyright, not the person who gave the AI a directive to create something with only a few keywords.
