Work using AI should not qualify for copyright protection, including written works/books, illustrations/artwork, and any other publication.  AI at its core uses the content of real creators to generate what is requested of the user.<br/><br/>AI is dangerous in that it can be used to duplicate or mimic the work, style, or look of someone else.  I believe all AI content generators should be required to state that AI was used in their creation, whether in whole or in part, even if the AI material was later modified.  It might further be beneficial for such material to contain some sort of mark or stamp or notice, required of content generators such as ChatGPT and OpenAI.  This should be done in a way that does not risk falsely accusing those not using AI of doing so.<br/><br/>There is also a societal risk of AI content generation, especially if allowed alongside original, human-generated content.  This risks many wannabe artists using AI as a shortcut to getting content to market, making it more difficult for legitimate artists to be found.  It could have the impact of making human beings more collectively less creative, as more and more people turn to AI generation to quickly do what they would otherwise have needed their own brain for.  AI also makes the market less attractive for real creators, who already have an uphill climb to making a living as an artist, writer, illustrator, etc.
