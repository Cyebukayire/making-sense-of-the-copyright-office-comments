It&#39;s extremely important to protect copyright of authors and refuse to allow AI to use these copyrighted pieces. If the makers and developers of AI want to &quot;train&quot; these AI systems, they need to do so with pieces that aren&#39;t copyright protected. If they want to use a copyright piece in their AI, they need to receive the express permission of the author, AND agree upon monetary compensation. The name of the piece and author should be listed in a section explaining which pieces of writing were used to train that AI system. As of now AI developers are stealing copyright materials without compensation or acknowledgment. This is wrong and should clearly be defined as illegal activity. Copyright work is copyrighted for a reason and should be protected from AI thieves looking to gain through exploitation.
