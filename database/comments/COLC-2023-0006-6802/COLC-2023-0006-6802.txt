It should not be considered a legitimate use of another person&#39;s intellectual property or copyright to use such materials to train generative AI absent permission. It should especially not be permitted to them market that AI commercially or otherwise obtain profit from that AI without permission of the creators used to train it, much less without compensating those creators. Those who create generative AI should be held responsible for the misinformation generated by their AI system, especially misinformation that is then published as fact (see many books cropping up in digital form that are the product of generative AI and are dangerously mistaken on the facts). Since the generative AI itself is not a sentient being, sentient beings must be held responsible for its work products, or there is vast potential for abuse and chaos in our society. <br/><br/>All that said, AIs show remarkable capabilities and immense promise for the betterment of society. But we must place sensible restrictions around their training and implementation such that this powerful technology serves our society rather than abusing and endangering the people who live within it.
