The use of A.I is being used in dangerous way and is evolving at a rapid rate. <br/><br/>1. Non- Creatives are using it to artificially recreate and profit off the works of artists. Such as running the artist&#39;s work, animation, writing, editing, music, even the voices of deceased voice actors though an A.I in order to train it and sell their &quot;works&quot; to people who don&#39;t see the different. Even giant companions like Disney are using A.I to fill in roles that should be done by a human being because they would rather use it then pay people. Those who work in the creatives are worried that they&#39;ll lose their jobs to A.I or have a deceased loved one&#39;s work be dragged through the mud. <br/><br/>2. Recently A.I is being to generate fake videos of mainly celebrities, I don&#39;t think I need to go into details about how this can quickly evolve to be used to severely damage a regular person&#39;s life. The one with A.I can easily use it to make-up/ generate horroriffic evidence and easily get away with it, while the one accused can get backlash at best or life in prison at worse.  <br/><br/>3. It can be used to generate and create CP. Now, there will be those using A.I who will counter with &quot;But this is better ! Real children won&#39;t be harmed !&quot;. <br/><br/>Which (to me at least) is a bold face lie, A.I can&#39;t make stuff up on it&#39;s own it needs to have feed going through it in order to &quot;train&quot; it. So in order for pe**s to create their..... &quot;content&quot; they have to get pictures, videos, even VOICES of CHILDREN in order to make it. How long will that last until they start going after the real children used for it, once they get bored of the A.I ?  I don&#39;t think I have to say anymore about this. <br/><br/>There needs to be rules put in place, if not rules then just shut it down.  Don&#39;t wait until something happens.
