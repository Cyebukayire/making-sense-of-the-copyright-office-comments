As a working artist in the field of comics, as well as a college-level teacher in the same field, I am troubled by the prospect of images generated through AI/machine learning being protected by copyright, as the sources from which these tools scrape and create their datasets are original pieces whose creators will not benefit in any way from their use, and it jeopardizes the economic future of trained working artists.<br/>Every original piece I create is made with a specific intended purpose, either as a personal piece or for a paying client. When I share a personal piece online, through a portfolio site or through social media, it is to cultivate a community of readers, patrons, and fellow artists, as well as cultivate a publicly available body of work on whose merits I can be hired to create new pieces. These pieces, made with intention, are not raw ingredients in which an algorithmic tool can absorb and extrude a new piece for a consumer&#39;s benefit. Worse yet, a comic that I created specifically for a client, be that an individual, organization, or publisher, is at risk of being scraped by AI and repurposed, diluting the commercial value of the piece I was hired to create and jeopardizing the working relationship with my clients.<br/>Moreover, as a teacher whose responsibilities include preparing students to become creative professionals in a technologically volatile industry, I am troubled by a potential future of copyright in which the working artist can no longer rely on their ownership of their own intellectual property being respected if they are to participate in the creation of art for commercial work or public engagement. Such a future would cripple the economic and legal power of a substantial fraction of the American workforce.<br/>
