GenAI made by the likes of Midjourney, Stable Diffusion etc all use copyrighted works without any permission from the creator. The LAION dataset is used for every single piece of AI generated piece of art. LLMs scraped millions of words from people&rsquo;s personal posts, again, without permission. - there is absolute no justifiable way to allow any piece of AI created work to be allowed to be copyrighted. Furthermore, I do not think OpenAI et al should be allowed to continue using the data that was scraped without permission to fuel their products and make a profit by selling the usage of their tools that only work but capitalising on others&rsquo; personal work.<br/><br/>Companies seeking to use works created by AI should have to pay a tax equal to or greater than that cost of hiring a professional in the field. <br/><br/>Any works made by using AI to specifically reference another&rsquo;s work, should face the same legal ramifications of direct and intentional plagerism.
