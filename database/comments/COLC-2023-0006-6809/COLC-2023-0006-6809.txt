The Constitution states that the function of patents, copyrights, and trademarks is &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.&quot;<br/>This does not apply to AI-generated works. <br/>AI does not think; it merely rearranges data fed into it. It takes existing works and rearranges their parts. <br/>AI will slow progress in the arts. If AI-generated works are copyrightable, no one will pay a living wage to artists.
