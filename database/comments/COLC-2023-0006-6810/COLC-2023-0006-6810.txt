The US Constitution gives authority only to Congress to enact significant changes to the rules. (See Article I, Section 8, Clause 8) Therefore, the US Copyright Office (USCO) should maintain its current stance that non-human creation of writings is outside its authority to grant. Consider ATF&#39;s litigation given recent changes to rules absent clear guidance from Congress. Granted USCO is a part of Congress, but the Constitution in this case anticipates action from the representative political body. Congress should consider legislation instead. This shifts the burden to the appropriate office of government, and helps stiffle controversy and future litigation directed to the USCO by its detractors.<br/><br/>US Copyright is intended to protect and incentivize human creativity; machine-generated content of this nature was not fathomed at the clause&#39;s writing. AI doesn&#39;t &quot;create&quot; in the traditional sense; it processes data using pre-defined algorithms. Much of that data is dubiously sourced, questioning the legitimacy of a right granted to an AI. Granting AI copyright could diminish the value of human creativity. It would chill the creation of content and likely the further development of future AI algorithms. Allowing AI to hold copyrights will flood the market with AI-generated content, devalue original human work and monopolize certain sectors. This is especially true since an AI can hold a vast amount of information, and could theoretically drown a single creator. This cannot promote the useful arts, and will undermine the public good.<br/><br/>Copyright law promotes the arts by granting a financial incentive on the author, though the protection is not limited to for-profit works. AI does not benefit from financial incentives in the way humans do. Instead, its wealth flows to the AI&#39;s developers and owners, centralizing wealth and creating monopolies. This will stiffle competition and innovation in the long run. Thus granting copyright to AI undermines the premise of Copyright law.<br/><br/>Current copyright law presumes a living creator based of identifyable legal status. AI are applications, programs, algorithms. They are unliving and lack legal status. Thus the rights would fall on the parent corporation, see above, or would fail to attach.<br/><br/>Extending copyright to AI would fundamentally shift the balance of the system and could lead to unintended consequences that stray from copyright&#39;s primary objectives.
