AI should not be given equal copyright to those who originally created the materials on which said AI was trained on. More often than not the materials used in training modules for AI is used without the knowledge or consent of the original creators. Take, for instance, the Getty Images vs. Stability AI lawsuit in which the plaintiff Getty Images accuses the defense of using millions of stock images to train their AI without the exchange of royalty fees for use of said images. Regardless of the validity of the plaintiff&#39;s claims the case poses the realistic dilemma of the piracy and unfair use of millions, or potentially billions, of copyrighted and protected images, videos, and audio clips.<br/><br/>This is not even taking in to consider the affects of AI specially in the film industry which will cost thousands of jobs in America, adding to the already dire unemployment rate.<br/><br/>I urge you to place strict regulations on the use of AI for commercial means so that this country and its economy can avoid a potentially devastating period of economic recession.
