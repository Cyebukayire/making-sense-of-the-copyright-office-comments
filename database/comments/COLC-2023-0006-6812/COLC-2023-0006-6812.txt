AI is just a new user interface for human operators to create content.  It doesn&#39;t do anything people do not already do, and it is being incorporated into every tool we use to make media (word, google docs, grammarly, photoshop, premiere).  If the copyright office bans its use in copyrighted works, or makes registration of works very difficult, multinational companies will still use it, because the can afford to jump through hoops or use trademakrks and other tools to make selling generated work protectible. Individual artists will not be able to do those things.  So they will stop registering their work at the copyright office in many cases because they used one or more AI tools in its creation and do not want to risk tryimg to register it for fear the copyright office will deny registration.  Better to treat AI enabled work as we have always treated creative work (whether created by camera, xerox machine, or photoshop).  Is the work transformative.  Google Books mashes together millions of copyrighted works, huge portions of those works, and it was accepted for copyright.  Google uses bots every day to scrape the internet, and its pages are protected by copyright. How is a unique Midjourney image any different? They frequently take many iterations to create, and are  taken into other editors to finalize. Penalizing people for using a natural language editing tool is odd...
