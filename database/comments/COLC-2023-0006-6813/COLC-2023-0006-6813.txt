AI has no place in art.  Art is what makes humans human.  It&#39;s the outward expression of human emotion, passion and creativity.   Art cannot, by definition, be created by a computer algorithm regurgitating the butchered likenesses of something a real person made.<br/><br/>Algorithms aren&#39;t people, aren&#39;t human, aren&#39;t real.  Everything output by an algorithm is a fraudulent mockery, and that should not EVER have the chance to become the dominant producer of art.  It should not put real people, the very people it&#39;s fed it&#39;s data from, out of work, out of homes, out of sharing their genuine, vibrant creativity with the world.  Maybe there are people who want to see stale, formulaic computer-generated stories and images for a novelty, but no one wants to see that indefinitely.  We look to art to see and hear a message, to find a bit of ourselves reflected back from the heart, mind and life experience of an artist that has the skills to put to paint and word and shape what we cannot for ourselves.  To share and enjoy together as viewers and readers, but also with the artist that made what we love.<br/><br/>Whenever you see a beautiful piece of art, a genius bit of acting or read a perfectly written sentence, you wonder: who made this?  We look for the names of painters and singers and composers and writers and actors and a thousand other kinds of artist, and we seek out who they are, how they came to create what we loved.  We ask questions and follow their work and aspire to meet them.  Our minds are broadened and inspired by the art, but also by the artist.<br/><br/>AI is nothing.  It is a thief, but a cold, lifeless one that never needed or wanted anything.  It takes without thought all the hard work, all the brilliant flares of inspiration that came in the middle of the day or jolted someone awake at night, and scrapes it down to formulas and numbers, then shuffles them together in an order that&#39;s statistically right and presents this monstrosity in a moment, effortlessly and without any meaning.<br/><br/>AI and the algorithms must be reigned in and regulated.  Stopped from stealing livelihoods, but also from violating the very spirit of human artistic expression.
