AI that trains on copy-write protected artwork without the artist&rsquo;s permission or knowledge is theft. The generated artwork is not original in many cases, as it&rsquo;s too close to the protected art. Training should only be allowed on work in the public domain or with explicit written permission from the artist. Anything less is a disincentive for working artists to create new work.
