I strongly do not think AI-generated writing should be open to copyright protection. Nobody arranged the words. An algorithm did. Even in the event of somebody changing out a gender or name in the context of an AI-generated story should not be protected. This is people plugging in a handful of words to generate a full-length novel (10,000+) while actual writers spend days, weeks, months, years carefully choosing the words to reflect what they Want to say, not what simply works best in a prompt.<br/><br/>The Hallmark of art should be the fingerprint that humanity leaves upon it.
