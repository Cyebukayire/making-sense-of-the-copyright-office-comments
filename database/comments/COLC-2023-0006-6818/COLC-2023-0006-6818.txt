I write as a third party looking into the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence in the workforce. In my years I&#39;ve seen how technology has evolved with humanity as a tool to assist people. The argument is that technology, due to AI tech, has evolved passed the need for human input to where it would replace the human user. The introduction of AI tech has brought into question if the human element is even needed whereas ten years ago technology was at a point where we were evolving with it. Because of this advancement, that question of the necessity of people has become prominent. AI tech has taken from different users, creators and artists to where a computer can create art akin to Disney or Ghibli with creativity or talent while taking from those style. The likeness and voice of a person can be manipulated in ways that shouldn&#39;t be, from actors to politicians and even to the basic online streamer. Technologists will not like it however the reality is technology should be slowing down to let humanity work with it instead of be replaced by it. That being said there are companies that are choosing to or have removed the human element. At the lowest, companies like Sam&#39;s and Target have replaced most tellers with digital check outs. At the higher ends, Disney and Universal area replacing whole writing teams with AI tech and now look to replace musicians and actors only to have their likeness while paying out the minimal amount. If technological advancement can not be stopped, then it must be limited and contained to the highest amount. If not, there is a chance you&#39;d see higher unemployment levels among other things. I request a limit to a full halt to the advancement in technology.
