As we barrel forward towards a future enriched by machines and computing power, we run a real risk as a society of forgetting that human beings have souls, have wants, have ambition, have creative power, have compassion, while computers have none of these things. And in this forgetfulness, so easily brought about because of the level of sophistication that AI uses to merely mimic human language and artistry, I fear we are very close to granting inalienable human rights to a soulless circuitboard. <br/>I am a concept artist in the entertainment industry. I&#39;ve spent over a decade studying, working long hours, and building human relationships to secure a career in which I could provide for my family of four. I am not and never have been searching for fame or a lucrative paycheck. Like so many others, I want to raise my kids securely in a country that values their generation, their parents&#39; generation, and their own children&#39;s generations as purposeful. As human. <br/>In 2020, I had my first child and in 2022, my second. I have been out of work raising both of them since, all while looking to rejoin the workforce once they start school. But around the end of 2022, I watched in horror as generative AI started to take off and almost overnight, the art commission industry that I used to rely on dried up. Sources from inside the industry told me they had outsourced all their positions I would qualify for to a few AI experts, saving their company the salary of many an artist they would usually need.<br/>I understand the technology for AI exists and isn&#39;t going anywhere. But the datasets that these generative AI beasts use are an abomination of copyright infringement. Supporters harp on about &quot;it&#39;s just a tool,&quot; it&#39;s like the creation of photography,&quot; etc., but it is entirely different. The machine CANNOT be creative. To take a photo, to use an art tool, the human artist mind must still envision the image, must still understand principles of design and make a composition. The generative AI does this now, and it can only do it because it has fed off of billions of images scraped from the web. The supporters will say that it&#39;s &quot;fair use,&quot; but when it takes away my means of employment? My means of supporting my family? I&#39;ve never once cared that my art would be viewed by other human beings. That&#39;s the point of publishing it publicly on the web. I am a social species. I love to inspire others and be inspired. I love that we as humans can all learn from each other. But I would never, EVER give permission for a machine to effectively consume my creativity, learn from it and regurgitate it. My art has been scraped by these programs. It sickens me. I feel violated on a deeply disconcerting level. There is so much surveillance already, so much lack of privacy, but now the machine wants the rights to bastardize our creative work? Even worse, to turn around and make all of us collectively who have trained it become obsolete? How is that &quot;fair use?&quot;<br/>Like I said, the technology and the code won&#39;t change. I understand it&#39;s a losing battle in the long run. But the current datasets are a violation of copyright, even if it&#39;s a grey area currently. It&#39;s not good enough to just let the artist know their work has been used. It&#39;s not good enough to just back-compensate, if such a thing were possible amid the billions of images used. It&#39;s not good enough to have an opt-out option moving forward. The current datasets are an INFRINGEMENT and are UNETHICAL and need to be made illegal to use. And moving forward, if artists want to feed into a new training dataset, they need to OPT-IN. And it goes without saying that anything the generative AI spits out is authored by the machine, and therefore not copyrightable. If anything can be copyrighted, it&#39;s just the &quot;prompts&quot; and the software&#39;s dial settings because that&#39;s the only part that a human has actually touched.<br/>We are in real danger of losing our humanity, and losing it at the cost of making those at the top even richer, even more powerful. Our copyright laws are to protect us all, including the small individual. <br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my comments. I trust in your judgement to make the right, ethical decision concerning this dilemma. <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Collette
