AI ranges from simple theft (ai creating art based on art created by a human) to dangerous misinformation (ai created foraging guides encouraging people to eat poisonous plants). The only safe way to train an AI is with explicit consent from all involved; if that consent isn&#39;t given then there needs to be a way to protect the arts and protect writers and to protect scientists from having their work taken and used without their credit or consent.
