I am writing this comment regarding Artificial Intelligence and Copyright. I am someone who has made a living making creative works. It&rsquo;s something I both enjoy and can survive on, but not in a future where the Copyright Office gives legal permission for Artificial Intelligence to use copyrighted materials to generate content. It has already reduced the demand for original works, and the companies that provide such a service profit from it. <br/><br/>Making copies of original works for artificial intelligence training in any form should never be fair use, and yet this is how they all are made. Large companies should be required to ask to legally license these works for training, and accept a no when it is given. This is how the creative industry has operated for years, and how workers have managed to make a sustainable amount of income.<br/><br/>I don&rsquo;t see how it could possibly be legal to allow these rich companies to continue blatantly stealing from creatives in this way. Even their argument of artificial intelligence being &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; and &lsquo;allowed to learn like a human&rsquo; is weak - it is just a product like any other, and should be regulated as such. <br/><br/>I implore you, please, to not let them take the right to truly own our work away from us.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.<br/>
