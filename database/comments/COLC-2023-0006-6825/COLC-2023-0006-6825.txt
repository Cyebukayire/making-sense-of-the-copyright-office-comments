In my experience, the use of AI has been primarily theft of the livelihood of other artists, be they those that draw, write, or act. The use of AI encourages theft and devalues the hard work and many hours of time that artists pour into their work, with most of these thefts directly negatively impacting the artists liveliehoods. Many have spoken out about just how violating it is to have their work, and especially their voices, stolen and used without their consent. There is no amount of regulation that will resolve the theft issue. AI cannot be allowed to be used. People&rsquo;s lives depend on it, as companies are already turning away from individual people and their talents in order to instead use the cheaper alternative of AI, and it is heartbreaking to see.
