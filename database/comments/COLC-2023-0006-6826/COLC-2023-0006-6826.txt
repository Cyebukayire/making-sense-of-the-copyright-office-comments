I&#39;ve reviewed (https://www.copyright.gov/laws/hearings/Response-to-May-1-2023-letter-re-AI-Material.pdf) and I want to note that cultures of &quot;AI&quot; and &quot;Cyber&quot; need to come to an end. In the past months, I&#39;ve joined members of the American Historical Association (where I am a member) to recommend such to the White House. Cultures of &quot;AI&quot; and &quot;Cyber&quot; are related to the &quot;Lavender Scare&quot; of the mid-20th century and to protests against male authority, university systems, internet, ARPANET, and military stealth programs, by those with G.ender, S.exuality, and I.dentity issues. Let&#39;s do &quot;computer&quot; and &quot;information systems&quot; instead.
