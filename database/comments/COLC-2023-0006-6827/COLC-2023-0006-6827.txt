I am extremely concerned about the way current art and writing AIs are being trained using visual and written works found on the internet, particularly as an artist and writer who has uploaded works that I know have been scraped by the Common Crawl. Understanding that things uploaded to the internet can be viewed by anyone, I believe it is a violation of my and all other artists&#39; intellectual property rights to have our creations used in this way without our explicit permission. I have also seen many individuals claiming that they no longer see the point in commissioning artists or reading fiction when they can simply &quot;ask&quot; an AI to make it for them.
