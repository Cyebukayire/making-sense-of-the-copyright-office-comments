Hi, I&#39;m an artist and honestly everything involving ai and art has been more than a little soul crushing. It has been used as a tool to hurt artists and their livelihoods way more than any other outcome. Allowing ai &#39;art&#39; to be copyrighted will only prop up more scams and real authors and artists being screwed over(see the famous authors who are having ai books with their name on them put on Amazon to make a quick buck).
