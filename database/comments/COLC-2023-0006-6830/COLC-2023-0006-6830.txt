The AI products that are being provided by companies like OpenAI, Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Stability AI, ArtStation, Twitter and many more, were trained on data, without notifying or receiving consent to do so from the creators of the original works. The arguments made by theses companies, that the license of open data permits them to do so is also incorrect. <br/><br/>This is pure theft from these companies. These companies should be held accountable for their actions.<br/><br/>These companies must also be asked to provide better clarification of how they use data for training AI. Here is an example where, Mozilla Foundation , along with four lawyers, three privacy experts, and two campaigners look at Microsoft&#39;s new Service Agreement, which will go into effect on 30 September, could not understand if Microsoft plans on using user&#39;s personal data &ndash; including audio, video, chat, and attachments from 130 products, including Office, Skype, Teams, and Xbox &ndash; to train its AI models.<br/>This is how these companies keep getting away with such anti consumer practices. <br/><br/>Another example - This is a tweet from a user, who is showing that Adobe violated their own Terms of Service (link to original tweet also provided) : <br/>Dear @Adobe You mentioned your AI  images uses the Adobe stock library only and guarantees the artist gets a royalty.<br/>Then can you explain why my name is in your library and there are a bunch of AI generated images with my name without my consent or prior knowledge? <br/>Please RT https://t.co/UgfKmHpg6C<br/><br/>https://twitter.com/victongai/status/1691124281718267904<br/><br/>This is proof that these companies wilk try to get away with stealing data from hardworking people. There are many other similar cases which can be seen on social media. I know many artists who rely on commission work, which uses their preferred artstyle, to make a living. Even with harsh criticism from users, who are unable to do anything, these companies simple do nothing to rectify their mistakes. This is because these companies know they can get away with it. This is why strict regulation on AI need to be in place.<br/><br/>Twitter or X, a social media app, is updating their terms of service to include all public information to be used for training their AI model. Many artists make their living through this app. They have to make their art public to get commision work, which now they are being forced to be trained for AI. <br/><br/>In this day and age, where many people are struggling to make a living, these companies will try to reduce costs as much as possible to keep their share prices high. The easiest way these companies achieve that is through mass layoffs. There is no guarantee that the people who lose their jobs to AI, will ever be compensated for their work which went into training the AI in the first place. Consider the WGA, SAG-AFTRA strike, where many members can&#39;t even afford a living and hence insurance.<br/><br/>Google, recently updates their Terms of Service, claiming they WILL use anything on the open Internet to train their AI models. Many people make a living through their own websites or blogs, which they keep open to attract consumers. Just because they make their content available on the Internet, does not mean, a corporation like Google can make take it for themselves or make a profit for themselves. <br/><br/>The Internet, was built with an open ideology, one that of freedom, not for profit. That ideology is what created many technologies that we all use today (referring to open source projects). These companies use and are training AI models on those free and open source projects created by people, for other people to use as a choice when the products made by these companies become unbearable, or huge privacy nightmares. These companies, have used these projects for their own profit, without crediting or providing a revenue for the developers. It obviously does not help when Microsoft owns a platform like Github where many of the open source projects are developed. <br/><br/>This also raises many questions - If I, as a person needs to post something on the Internet, I should assume that my work wilk be used by these companies without ever consulting me ? <br/><br/>If these companies are going to use other people&#39;s work to train their AI, it should be OPT IN, not opt out, meaning they should update their terms of service and privacy policy so that the users of their platform as well as third party services, should be able to decide, whether to participate in AI training. These companies should not assume that the users will consent to it.<br/><br/>Many users of the internet, are still not really educated when it comes to tech. That is being taken advantage of by these companies.<br/><br/>I, as a person has and will never want my personal information, or my skills to be used for training AI, without my consent. I hope necessary steps will be taken to ensure that AI generated work will never be copyrightable, and that these companies face the consequences of their actions.
