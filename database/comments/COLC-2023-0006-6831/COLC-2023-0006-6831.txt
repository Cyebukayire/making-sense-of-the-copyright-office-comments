Personally I think AI is ridiculous and takes away the creativity and work of people. Sure, making an algorithm takes time, but people that use AI don&rsquo;t make the algorithm. On the note of copyright, I 100% believe that AI is harmful to original creators and steals their work. I create art and post it online and I have to fear that I might find my hard work and time put into an AI algorithm making more money than I am. I see this happen a lot to other artists, they never gave permission for their content to be used. Posting things online does not equal consent.  I wholeheartedly believe that AI is a threat to my original content and steals the work of other people without proper consent.  Protective rights should have been put out before AI had a chance to rip off peoples work, hopefully this can change things and create a safer space for creators.
