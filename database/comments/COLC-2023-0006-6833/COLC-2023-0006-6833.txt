The use of copyrighted works to train AI models: I think there should be a data bank where those wishing to submit material for that reason can do so. Any unauthorized scrubbing of images and subsequent use for this purpose should not be allowed, and those working with AI&#39;s who do this should be held accountable for copyright infringement. Images no longer held under legal copyright can be used just as they are now in other media.<br/><br/>The copyrightability of material generated using AI models: As an illustrator, I do believe I can use AI generated images as a portion of my overall work. For example, I use stock photos for my work now to create book covers. I would use the AI generated images in the same manner, as part of the overall cover image. I do not want to see an entirely AI generated cover. I think the Copyright office should set a maximum use for AI generated work. I think setting something like no more than 10 percent or 20 percent AI generated content can be used in any original work. The issue will be the ability to enforce. All images will need to be reviewed. At the moment, it&#39;s pretty easy to pick out AI art, but that will not be the case for much longer as the AIs learn and the systems improve. In which case, it may mean ALL images being submitted for copyright, regardless of admitted use of AI prompted work, will need to be proven original works. That burden will fall to the individual requesting the copyright. That will be tricky, however. For example, I may generate 7-8 AI images that I take pieces of and rearrange in Photoshop to create the exact image I want, then use that as part of my overall concept. I do the same with stock photos. I see no difference. I do not agree that an AI image spit out and used as is without manipulation is copyrightable. But a work derived by using an AI image as a small part of another work should be allowed.<br/><br/>    The potential liability for infringing works generated using AI systems: If a work is derived from prompts input by the user, ie. using a stock photo or other original work to prompt the AI toward a specific output, and the stock photo/reference image is not properly licensed for use, that is infringement. All photos or other reference materials used to prompt the AI MUST be legally owned or licensed by the person prompting/generating the work, or in the Creative Commons, or permission granted by the original creator. <br/><br/>The treatment of generative AI outputs that imitate the identity or style of human artists: Artists copy style all the time. It&#39;s been done for centuries. It&#39;s how artists learn. What cannot be copied is the concept/output of the original artist. I can&#39;t paint a copy of another painting and use/sell it as an original work. IF the image(s) is/are created in order to impersonate someone else or someone else&#39;s artwork, that is clear infringement. If I say I want to render the image of a dog in the style of Monet, that shouldn&#39;t be infringement, because all that means is using Monet&#39;s teaching methods for strokes, texture, shading, color palette, etc. If I prompt I want a painting of The Scream by Munch, I should not be able to copyright or use in any manner that artwork, even if I state it&#39;s a derivative of Munch&#39;s The Scream.
