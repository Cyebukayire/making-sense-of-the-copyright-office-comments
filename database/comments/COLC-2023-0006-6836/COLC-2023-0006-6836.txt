AI does not constitute fair-use of copyrighted material.  I&#39;m not an attorney, but neither am I an ignoramus. I have to follow the rule of law if i want to use something I discovered via an internet search. And, if I don&#39;t, the owner of the copyrighted material has recourse to sue me.  <br/><br/>If I buy a stolen car, my ignorance of it&#39;s being stolen does not prevent the rightful owner from reclaiming it. <br/><br/>Those two concepts, taken together, suggest that any AI products trained on copyrighted material without the consent of the copyright holder should simply be destroyed, as there is no way to remove the material from the AI.<br/><br/>I also want to comment on your use of reCAPTCHA - AI can solve these more reliably than humans.
