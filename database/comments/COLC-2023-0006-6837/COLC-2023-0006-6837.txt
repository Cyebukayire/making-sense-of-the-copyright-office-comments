I have seen AI used artistically, using artists (musicians&rsquo;) voices, but that means that the artist who lives and makes money off their voice is having that taken and licensed without their consent. <br/><br/>The AI is being used to do audio and speech - these things should be required to be clearly identified as AI. Otherwise, people will be able to generate fake quotes, do deepfakes, revenge porn. <br/><br/>AI is theft and shouldn&rsquo;t be monetized without authorization of original creator. It should be identified as AI.<br/><br/>AI information, like Wikipedia style answers, are going to get people killed from misinformation scraping. The creator will make money off their misinformation, and say it&rsquo;s not their fault they mispublished dangerous Frankenstein compilings of scraped data. <br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t let AI steal voices and glue together false info, please regulate this tool. It should be marked as AI, and original creator should be paid and consent to it.
