I appreciate the U.S. Copyright Office&rsquo;s interest in this topic. I am a university student working closely with a number of professors and researchers while I pursue my degree, and believe that the current regulations and practices surrounding A.I. are unethical. Particularly involving OpenAI and other similar technologies, the usage of copyrighted work in their training algorithms without the copyright holders permission feels downright disrespectful from the authors of said work. I&rsquo;m referring specifically to writers of educational papers and essays used in research. I&rsquo;ve seen countless examples of research done by professors and other renowned specialists being used in writing generated by AI such as chat gpt which goes completely uncited, and expressively used without permission of the writer. I believe this sentiment extends to writers of fiction, artists, script writers, and other authors copyrighted works who&rsquo;s work is being used to train AI without their consent. There needs to be much tighter regulations on how AI is allowed to be trained and how people who use AI are allowed to profit off of it. Works generated by AI should outright not be allowed to be copyrighted and profited off of, be it by an individual or a corporate entity. This includes but is not limited to; scholarly essays, TV, movie, and play scripts, animation, books, illustrations, news articles, and other things in a similar vein. I hope that the U.S. Copyright Office will take these concerns in genuine consideration and will opt to take appropriate action to protect the rights of copyright holders and prevent people and corporations from copyrighting work generated by AI. Thank you for your time.
