The current US Copyright ruling in non-human generated creatives should stand and be written into the US Copyright Law. AI Generated creatives are the product of open source and copyrighted material theft. AI generated products are plagiarism on the highest scale, should not be protected, and should lead to legal ramifications when used for profit or gain. LLMs pull words and information from the internet to answer a prompt,  much like a research paper. However, the LLM does not provide source information for the data it produces, and, therefore, cannot account for the accuracy or truth of that data. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT and Doll-E 2.0 (a text-image model), conducted research into the potential misuse of large language models (LLM) in creating disinformation. They concluded that there are no protective or preventative measures to stop AI Generated language and imagery from being misused (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.04246). However, strong litigation and policy can be created to enforce protection over those intellectual properties that are being stolen by LLM and text-to-image models. Art theft, in particular, should be more thoroughly scrutinized, as artists&#39; names are being used in AI generator prompts. This goes beyond a novice emulating a master: this is the destruction of an artist&#39;s livelihood. The US Copyriggt office has a duty to help protect individuals from the theft of their intellectual property and creating strong policies and laws prohibiting the use of AI generated products is the best way forward.
