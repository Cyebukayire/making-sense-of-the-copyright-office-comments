Works that are generated by A.I. should not be copyrightable. While there are claims that the works created would be copyrightable if done by a human, this argument ignores the time and effort required by humans to produce said works, as opposed to the rapid, near effortless production by computers.<br/>The field of automation was important in allowing our society to move beyond most people laboring on farms, and has been an important step in allowing for more creative fields to prosper. The safety net for creative professionals has been copyright law, allowing for individual ownership of creative work.<br/>Automation should come at the improvement of humanity.<br/>The sudden advancement of automation in creative professions does not add to the improvements of those fields, but instead treats humans as replaceable in those positions.<br/>If humans weren&#39;t involved in such creations, they should not be allowed copyrights.<br/>They should, however, be held liable for intellectual property theft of other artists in their works, as I would be, were I to sell photocopies of a painting to which I do not own the rights to.
