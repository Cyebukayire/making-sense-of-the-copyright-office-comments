AI is completely unregulated to the detriment of artists whose work is being stolen, without compensation, to train these computer models. Copyright law is clear: only works created by a human being can be eligible for copyright and typing in a few words or phrases to generate a digital image or a book -- one that is likely to be plagiarized or infringed -- should not be protected. It is no different than typing a few words or phrases into a search bar and attempting to claim ownership of the results that the search engine displays.<br/><br/>Please, make it law that work generated by AI cannot be protected by copyright unless 75%+ of it has been changed as a result of work a human being has done to it. Ruling that copyright can protect these generated results would have catastrophic consequences for artists whose work was used, more often than not, without permission and without their consent. Books on the shelves with passages plagiarized, companies profiting off of art done in the style of a particular artist without ever compensating them for their vision and craft, video game creators stealing the voices of popular voice actors to avoid paying their performance fees... the list can go on and on.<br/><br/>We are already seeing it with Disney&#39;s use of AI with one of their latest shows, Secret Invasion. The writers and actors are on strike particularly because the studios are trying to exploit hard working Americans for profit. Please keep AI in check and make it clear to anyone who attempts to use it that none of the work that is generated is protected.
