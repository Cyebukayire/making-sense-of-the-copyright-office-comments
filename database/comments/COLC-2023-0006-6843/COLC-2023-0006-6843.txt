AI negatively impacts artist, writers, and/or music artists. AI, for lack of better terms, takes already pre-exsisting &#39;data&#39; to create an output. AI takes art that someone else made, without the artist&#39;s premission, to make something &#39;new&#39;. This violates copyright, since the person who made the AI generated art didn&#39;t ask premission from the original artist to use their work that the AI user could profit from. This would then cause the artist to loose any future profits for the work that they created.
