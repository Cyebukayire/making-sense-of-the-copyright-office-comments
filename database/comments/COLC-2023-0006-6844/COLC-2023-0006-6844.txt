I like the advancements that AI offers to creatives. I&#39;m an author and use AI products to brainstorm plots, characters, and marketing. There is a lot of human input and revision whenever I use an AI product. But AI saves so much time from having to google everything separately. I believe the criteria that the copyright office used before is perfect--nothing I receive from an AI platform is publishable from the product generated, and the human decision-making or revision is what makes the novel unique and marketable. The human element is hugely significant!
