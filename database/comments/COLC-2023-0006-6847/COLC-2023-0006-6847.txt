The use of generative AI for creative works presents a two-fold danger to existing and potential future traditional creators. Firstly, it floods the market with AI-generated productions that companies may opt to use due to low cost instead of human created productions available at the usual market rates. Additionally, generative AI uses data scraped from a wide range of sources on the internet and few AI software makers can prove what has or has not been scraped. This leads to an ethical concern that previously made copyrighted content is being &quot;scraped&quot; and used as source material for the generative AI to generate from. This removes the right of anyone using generative AI to copyright their source as they cannot accurately compensate or even cite the source material their generated product is pulled from. This is very different from manually making a collage as a collage creator chooses each part individually and is aware of where each part comes from. Attempting to copyright an AI generated work is like ordering food from a restaurant and then trying to claim you made it yourself.There is no room for widespread generative AI in a field of creative media.
