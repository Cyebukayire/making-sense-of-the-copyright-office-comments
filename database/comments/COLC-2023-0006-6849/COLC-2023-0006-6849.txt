The world wide web began with the letter &ldquo;h&rdquo; sent across the Atlantic. It is this acceleration that must be considered with copyright law.<br/>The law was written without generative AI in mind. An individual writing stories to imitate Stephen King can only write so much - but genAI can write hundreds of pages in minutes. The quality of the pages is irrelevant; remember the &ldquo;h&rdquo;? Of great import is the &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the style of&rdquo; command. &ldquo;Paint a picture in the style of Keith Haring&rdquo;. The automative and replicative nature of genAI is what makes it a threat. <br/>When a robot takes over a job like screwing a bolt, it is &ldquo;helping&rdquo; by ridding us of repetitive labor. GenAI as it is used by artisans is similar, but GenAI in the hands of corporations seeks to replace those same artisans who love the work, their purpose for being. <br/>There are likely others who can express this better than myself. Good luck to you all at the Copyright Office. The investigative work you complete here will change generations of culture.
