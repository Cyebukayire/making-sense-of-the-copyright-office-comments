It has been disheartening and frankly frightening to see books uploaded to Amazon for people to buy that use made-up author&rsquo;s names and were written entirely AI, knowing that in all likelihood, my own written work that exists online has been scraped by these machines and is being used to train them without my consent. As a teacher, it is even more difficult to discern whether students are using AI to write their papers for them. Teachers know that students should be given every opportunity to publish their work in order to make their learning meaningful and that this facilitates the learning process itself, and students often proudly post their work online for their community members to see with this mind. Now, in doing so, they are subjecting themselves to potential for AI to scrape and steal their work, the work of *children*, alongside that of professional writers and other adults. Beyond being terrifying, this goes against everything that the copyright office stands for, both legally and in terms of the principles the office stands for.
