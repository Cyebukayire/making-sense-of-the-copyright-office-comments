AI is a tool that is here to stay - the horse has bolted so there is no point attempting to bolt the gate now. Most authors that I know using AI in both art and the text versions as using it only as a tool. For art - most will clean up the image anyway and it&#39;s no different than a human looking at a 100 paintings of cats and then making a picture of a cat - humans are not accused of copying so why is an AI program like MidJourney that is essentially doing the same thing.<br/><br/>In terms of writing tools, this also I believe, should have no bearing on restricting someone&#39;s copyright. At this stage there is no AI program capable of producing a coherant book with plot and characters. It is a useful tool but there is still a lot of human imput in creating, adjusting and editing. <br/><br/>Gatekeeping the work people are producing is archaic in my opinion. Technology and methods change and evolve and AI is assisting many in particular with disabilities - why should their work not have the same copyright protection because they incorporated using a tool. No program is &quot;stealing&quot; work - yes, it&#39;s unsettling to think the algorithm can evolve to &quot;learn&quot; but this is the future.
