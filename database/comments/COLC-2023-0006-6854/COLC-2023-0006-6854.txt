I&#39;m an author of over forty books that took me a long time to write, using my own imagination and talent. I&#39;m absolutely against AI-generated material being copyrighted since almost every single AI-generator has been trained illegally on copyrighted material, whether it be images or text. Authors, photographers, models, celebrities, journalists, illustrators, and more have had their works stolen and used without their consent for people to generate new material that only took the entry of a few keywords.
