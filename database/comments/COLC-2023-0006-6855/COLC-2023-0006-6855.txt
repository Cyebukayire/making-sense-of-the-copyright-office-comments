I request that AI generators and entities that train AI models obtain the rights to use data and information from others whose content is protected by copyright. Licensing or purchasing the data used to train models is a minimum expectation to avoid the exploitation of creators and artists who have made original work that would be copied and used to support the income of others than the original creator. Also, any works created by an AI model should not be allow to gain copyright protection as if it was a product of an individual&#39;s creativity or effort.
