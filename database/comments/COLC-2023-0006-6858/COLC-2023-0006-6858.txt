As someone who creates digital art and software I have a few thoughts that I&#39;d like to share on the subject of Generative AI.<br/><br/>With generative AI, tech companies have wrapped old fashioned computer assisted remixing in the language of art in order to seem like innovation. Through so called &quot;training&quot; generative AI takes copyrighted works and converts them into a compressed state where they can algorithmically be recreated. This is called &quot;training&quot; because if it weren&#39;t it would be obvious that copyright infringement had occurred. JPEG compression is a clear case of a computer generated derivative work and the ability of generative AI to store works as &quot;training&quot; is just a more sophisticated form of compression. At the very least the burden of proof as to whether some new software should be thought of &quot;trained&quot; like an artist should be on the developer not copyright holders. Ultimately the works of generative AI are akin to a machine assisted collage and should be treated as so legally. <br/><br/>I also take issue with the concept of generative AI as creators. Its proponents would have us believe that some new breakthrough in the ability of machines to think like people has been achieved. In reality what we have is a slightly better version of things like chatbots and autocomplete that have been around for decades. The mechanism for making a picture with generative AI is akin to a board game where players match cards of the front halves and back halves of different animals to create new ones. The cards would by picked by rolling dice whose numbers are weighted towards combinations that look good together. While generative AI is more elaborate, swapping at a finer level of detail and using tags and tables instead of dice, fundamentally the principles are the same. If one were to make such a board game the appropriate copyright interpretation would be clear: The game itself would hold no copyright, the players who manipulated it merely followed the rules and the artists whose work was featured in the game would still retain the rights to their work and the relevant rights to the derivative work.<br/><br/>AI as author is a slippery slope. If AI cannot be an author as current case law states then it is important that copyrighted material can&#39;t be fed into AI and altered slightly allowing it to become stripped of copyright. Alternatively, if the users of generative AI can hold copyrights on their output then it is important to make sure that it is seen as a derivative work of the thousands of people whose art has been automatically assembled to make it. If someone sees the glimmer of creativity in the finished art, that is not the artistic skill of the person who pressed the button&#39;s, nor is it an algorithm&#39;s but rather the combined skill of all the artists whose work has been appropriated. As such any copyright that does not acknowledge their contribution would also create an easy route to break copyright law for individual artists.<br/><br/>I am not trying to say that a computer might not someday be able to act with some level of human-like autonomy. Perhaps at such a point it&#39;s creations would warrant legal protection but if one examines the technology involved here with an ounce of skepticism it becomes clear how laughably far we are from such a scenario. What we have is at best an effort by the tech companies to over-hype iterative improvements to old technology and at worst an attempt to upend longstanding intellectual property laws for their own enrichment. Tech companies should not be taken at their word when they make claims that their technology is revolutionary. The burden of proof should be on them to demonstrate that what they have made is worthy of having special rules apply to it. That a computer program&#39;s actions should be thought of as &quot;training&quot; and not compression or &quot;creativity&quot; and not an algorithm is a lofty claim with massive legal implications. The mere fact that the U.S. Copyright office is considering special rules for AI already gives too much credence to the terms that were most likely chosen precisely because of their legal subtext.<br/><br/>Lastly there is the issue of risk to consider. If generative AI were to be treated the same as any other collage software and this turned out to be the wrong decision then the harm would merely be that a new innovation took a little longer be properly recognized. If on the other hand the very concepts of copyright creation and derivative works were to be upended we could find that artistic innovation is no longer rewarded because all creative endeavor is immediately packaged into a technical service and sold with no compensation to the artists that contributed to it.<br/><br/>Copyright is essential for individual artists to have their work valued and the damage to their livelihoods should be weighed heavily before a new untried technology is given unprecedented legal weight.
