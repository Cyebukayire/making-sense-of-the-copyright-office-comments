From what I understand, AI is transformative and uses the images only as I might to emulate a particular element of another artist or artists and is therefor fair use. Further, I&#39;ve labored for hours, nearly as long as it might take to have drawn an image outright and feel that AI art which I create should be copyrightable to the extent that any other work could be. In the event that a seed and prompt produce the same image however, I feel as though that copyright should be treated similar to work made with stock resources where the seed and prompt terms are treated as the stock resources. Presently, I use AI artwork that is generated in Australia where the copyrights are first claimed by the AI company and are then assigned to me. However, I feel as though AI models from the US are vastly better than those from Australia and would like to use them instead.
