Ai content can only be created by stealing the real content of a human. It should not be protected, it should not be easy to use and it should not be readily available. It is already making the lives of teachers much harder as they mark exams, and as for the original content that is plagiarised by the AI, the original creators get no financial compensation or credit. <br/><br/>You should not be able to create Ai content because it never produced anything original. It just shuffles content from real artists and real writers. Please do not allow ai content to be copyrighted.
