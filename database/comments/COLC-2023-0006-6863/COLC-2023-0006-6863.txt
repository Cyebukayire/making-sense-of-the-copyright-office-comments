Artificial Intelligence as it is today can&#39;t exist without breaking copyright. Any art it generates is based off other artists styles and work that it has stolen. Any writing is a regurgitation of other people&#39;s writing, smashes together. There is no acknowledgement of everyone whose work is taken without permission. It has scraped the internet with no regard for what has been entered into data to use as a basis. To properly compensate and credit the creators whose works are used there needs to be purposeful data submission. There is also no fact checking or review of what is put in, and as I have learned working with data for many years - garbage in, garbage out. There need to be guidelines and guardrails in place for AI effectiveness in the future.
