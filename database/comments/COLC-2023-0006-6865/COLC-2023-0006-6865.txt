AI is ruining real artists. I am sick of seeing everything fake. I have seen so many famous celebrities faces/likeness wearing things they would never wear. This is such a horrible idea. I can see this being used for all the wrong reasons. I have already seen authors and photographers losing business due to AI.  This needs stopped now.
