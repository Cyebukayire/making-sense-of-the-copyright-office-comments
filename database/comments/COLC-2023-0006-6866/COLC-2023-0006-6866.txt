As a writer, I have grave concerns about the possibility of AI utilizing anything I&rsquo;ve written to &ldquo;create&rdquo; its own works, both because of copyright infringement on the original work and also because AI attempts to &ldquo;write&rdquo; pose a clear risk to my future livelihood. While I can appreciate the benefit of AI in many contexts, I also see a tremendous risk both to currently existing works in terms of being stolen and in terms of future works as AI &ldquo;created&rdquo; content floods existing platforms (it is already happening in Amazon) with sub-par content, causing a glut that creators must wade through a d navigate in order for their work to be seen.
