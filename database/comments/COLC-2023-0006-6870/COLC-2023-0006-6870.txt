I strongly believe that works generated by artificial intelligence SHOULD NOT be viable for copyright. Copyrighting materials is to protect the work of humans and AI are not humans. Furthermore, AI producing art, music, writing, and so on have been trained on the work of human artists. Without them, AI would have nothing to build their works on in the first place. It is imperative to protect artists and their work, as thousands upon millions&#39; livelihoods are being threatened by corporations trying to capitalize on &quot;cheap labor&quot; without seeing the bigger picture. AI and robotics are meant to assist mankind, not usurp their roles in society and leave people jobless. Please protect citizens and do not allow AI to hold copyright over art or anything that has been produced by their algorithms.
