Consider a painter who has studied many works of art in a variety of books and museums. She has even copied several master works brushstroke by brushstroke in order to better understand the original painter&#39;s methods. She then produces a work of her own using the skills developed via such observation. I would hope that her work would be protected by copyright, and that the painters whose work she studied were not expected to be compensated. In much the same way, the effort of an artist prompting a computer system trained on other artists&#39; works is creating an original piece based on a statistical &quot;understanding&quot; of other artwork rather than copying said artwork directly.
