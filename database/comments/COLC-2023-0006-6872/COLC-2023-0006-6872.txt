Various people in the voice acting community have been struck by AI services that cannot and refuse to credit the source material their projects are built on. In the visual arts realm, many of my friends have their art blatantly stolen and their watermarks are still somewhat visible on them. It is an outrage that big companies w intimidating lawyers can strike anyone for using their IPe(i.e. Disney w their music, Nintendo with their characters) but us artists are suffering . There is also no fair usage clauses that can allow this: for example, if a project using AI sources from an artist agrees but do not have the details of the project, they can be voicing or promoting evil propaganda without their consent and against their own self interests. Act justly and swiftly; we cannot stand for this
