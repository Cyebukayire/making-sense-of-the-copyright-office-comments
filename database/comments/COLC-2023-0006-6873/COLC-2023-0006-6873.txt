I am of the opinion that work utilizing AI should not be available for copyright. I am very concerned about the devaluation of human labor, and, as an artist, am upset by the idea that my and my colleagues work could be scraped and used for profit with absolutely no credit. To achieve and maintain success in the modern age, an artist must post a portfolio online, but there are currently no adequate protections against work being added to a database.
