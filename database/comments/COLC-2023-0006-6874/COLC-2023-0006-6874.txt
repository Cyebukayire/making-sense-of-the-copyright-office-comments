A  potential intersection between Copyrights and Trademarks could exist when, for example, a drawing of a character in a comic book or animation movie become also a trademark to distinguish products and/or services. Considering that, my question is does trademarks also require human authorship? If the answer is no, then trademarks created through generative AI only cannot be recognized as valid trademarks. On the other hand, if the question is yes then one could register a trademark created by generative AI but won&#39;t have copyright protection. Companies will try to use their drawings as trademarks to make sure they have some IP protection.
