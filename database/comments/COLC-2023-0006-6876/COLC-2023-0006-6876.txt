AI is artificial, but it cannot be called intelligence. These models and machines are incapable of creating, only generating the most statistically sound response based on their dataset. And THAT dataset is being built from art that is being mined online without creator knowledge or consent. There are no regulations in place for this kind of practice, and therefore AI cannot fall under the protections of fair use, because AI generated content is being used outside the confines of fair use for profit in numerous cases. This unprecedented surge in &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; has provoked an unprecedented mass scraping of artists&#39; works of all types, and it is the US Copyright Office&#39;s job to protect the interests of artists and inventors, not the corporations who profit off pirating their ideas with glorified mathematical software.
