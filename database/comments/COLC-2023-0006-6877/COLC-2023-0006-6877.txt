I am not sure if this falls into this category. But my main concern with ai is it being used for revenge pornography. I have heard many devastating stories of women and even children who have been victims to ai in this way. On anonymous image boards like 4chan, there are ads that promote these sort of programs. I think programs like these should be completely illegal, people who use these programs and share those images should be registered sex offenders as they are doing this non consensually, this sort of stuff can completely damage someone&rsquo;s reputation for life, and it is hard to scrub these things off the internet. <br/><br/>As for ai used in art and writing, I think there needs to be more regulation on it. I think it is fine to use ai for small parts of your work and build off of it yourself. For example, with photography, I have seen ai used to change small imperfections like removing people from a background. But i think if an entire photo or other form of media is made using ai, no one should be able to profit off of selling it as it is not their work. I am not a typical artist but I am a cosplayer who makes all of my costumes from scratch, I have seen ai cosplay accounts pop up and one fear I have is that the program will copy my costume or likeness. It can takes months to even years to craft one costume depending on the detail so it would be disheartening to see someone make money off of these images using mine or someone else&rsquo;s cosplays with just a click of a button. While it can still overshadow the work of artists that people are able to replicate their work within seconds, I think the best course of action is to make it unprofitable. Most ai media is only posted in order to make a profit off of it as they are always posted by anonymous accounts.
