I worked my entire life in the arts. I was an Industrial Designer and put many products on the market. Then I turned toward filmmaking and writing. Writing a story is the most intimate form of personal creation I have ever done. I learned the rules of Copyright in regards to story and design in order to protect my hard won creative works. I have copyrighted many things. It is my personal and professional opinion that Ai-generated works are nothing other than derivative works manufactured solely on the works of human writers and artists. That is plagiarism plain and simple. Not only should Ai-generated works be banned from receiving copyright protection of any kind, I believe the Copyright office should be enforcing copyright infringement laws against the companies stealing our (artists, writers) works, be it visual or written or otherwise, for the creation of their Ai product. It is not ethical that they can intricately weave a product out of my products and call it new, and call it theirs. While this is a deeply offensive practice to me as an artist, I do believe this leaps both feet into the legal end of the pool. Copyright was created to protect the creators of the works.
