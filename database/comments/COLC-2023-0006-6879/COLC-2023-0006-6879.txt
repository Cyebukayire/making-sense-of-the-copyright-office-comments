As someone who supports of authors and artists, I am very concerned about the use of copyrighted materials to train AI. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Allowing generative AI to train on copyrighted works without permission from those Authors for the Right to their Writings is a violation of that. The Copyright Office should rule that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.
