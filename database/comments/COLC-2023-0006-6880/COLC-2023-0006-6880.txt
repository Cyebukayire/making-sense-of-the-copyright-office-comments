As an individual who dreamed of writing and publishing books from childhood and pursued that dream with discipline and integrity as an adult, the advent of AI in the field of writing and other creative arts is troubling in the extreme. AI is not hard work. It is not creative endeavor. It is not the process of a brain at play. It is the parasitic scraping of such human efforts by individuals who choose to take the easy route to perceived financial gain. It can only end in crippling an entire industry and damaging beyond salvage the efforts of authors past, present, and future. <br/><br/>Please take a firm, unarguable stance on AI in our field. Do NOT protect it.
