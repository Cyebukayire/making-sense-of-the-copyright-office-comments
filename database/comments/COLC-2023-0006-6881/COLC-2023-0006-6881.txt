In most cases, the result of machine learning processes should not be copyrightable.<br/><br/>Scraping a data set of often copyrighted images is a problem all on its own, but processing that data to generate something like an image or text is nothing but the most advanced version of filtering automated collaging, not human generated creativity.  Users of &quot;AI&quot; image software are setting filter parameters, sometime very complex filters based on text input, but no more than a giant SQL or Excel database filter, neither of which generates a copyrightable piece.  It is not a tool enabling direct creative input like a paint program, a text input program or even Photoshop.<br/><br/>An AI image program is akin to a very advanced image search where it tries to *make* the image you&#39;re searching for, often using other artist&#39;s copyrighted art, and returns a collage where the original materials sources are often, but not always, obscured .  That shouldn&#39;t be protectable as there is no person even doing the collage; it&#39;s all software filtering.  In the early days of ML art for example, you could see the Getty Images or Shutterstock watermarks on final images so you *knew* it was collaging from protected materials.  Even if the software has advanced to use a wider selection of images and is better at hiding it&#39;s sources it is not creating a new work.  <br/><br/>*IF* an artist generated the entire dataset used in a ML art tool on their own, so it *started* from their own non-infringing creative work, then maybe.<br/><br/>It does not add a new use or meaning to the works so it is not transformative in the useful definition either.  A database trained on horror scripts designed to generate a new horror script for a movie studio is not adding a new meaning or use; it&#39;s stealing the work of the original authors to make something they can&#39;t benefit from.  It harms the original copyright owners because it is generating similar works at a lower cost, devaluing their creative work.<br/><br/>What these really come down to is lower the cost for creative works for large corporations, which is unfortunate for the public at large, but putting that aside, there are plenty of strong reasons based on current copyright law that most of these cases should not be copyrightable.
