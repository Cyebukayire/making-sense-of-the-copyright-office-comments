I am an artist working in the Animation industry. It is clear that the major companies wish to use AI to replace human artists, while finding loopholes in legislature to eliminate the essential creative human beings who for years have made them very profitable. Their bottom line matters more than jobs for people who give like us artists who have dedicated years to our career abd craft to create art and stories build from human experiences that connects us. Removing the human factor from art, removes the connection we have as people of this world. <br/>Every single piece of media we enjoy has been created my human hands whether traditionally or digitally. The companies want to use AI to make works and then turn to use few people to touch them to bypass the copy right laws. End of the day, the fact that they still need humans shows you how aggressively unfair their choice to go fully automated to replace actors, artists, musicians, craftspeople, technicians, and everyone in between, knowing full well that their profits have been higher than ever thanks to the passionate workers that have dedicated so much. <br/><br/>Let&#39;s make sure we keep humans creating, let&#39;s make sure the next generations of creatives keep their dreams alive, just as much as those of you in congress have reached your goals to be someone. Do not allow these companies to remove that hope from the American people, and frankly the world. <br/><br/>We all connect through our abilities to share what makes us human. We should not fear losing the little we have left. This is an issue that is essential. You have the power to prevent companies from using AI to erase humanity from what connects us. I create because I can touch people. A machine will not express without connection the same way a person can, it will try to mimic, but it will not understand the reason behind choice, it will not have ethics, it will just take and regurgitate baseless information. It sets up a dangerous precedent, and an unstoppable storm where it only benefits tech companies <br/>if allowed to pass. Don&#39;t give on on people.
