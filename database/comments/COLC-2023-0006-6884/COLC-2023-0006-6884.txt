The Copyright Office has stated clearly in the past that copyrighted material must be created by humans to be protected under the law. If a monkey cannot own its own selfie, then OpenAI and other software companies that use algorithms to scrape reference material from the internet as a base for responses and products that are created by that software cannot be considered copyrighted material. Procedurally generated art is not copyrighted and neither should anything from OpenAI and other such products.
