Artificial &quot;intelligence&quot; is nothing but computers finding patterns on stolen images, writing, videos, and other creations. Then computers regurgitate the best approximation of the next iteration of what it thinks is the pattern. It is as intelligent as an autocorrect system made of stolen dictionaries, with little to no human moderation. It is extremely biased and almost entirely wrong. See its attempts at legal advice, food safety, and basic arithmetic for egregious examples. Allowing humans (who don&#39;t even do the work) to copyright these outcomes is dangerous, enabling theft, and extremely harmful to creators of all kinds: writers, musicians, painters, photographers, the list goes on. AI is both wrong in correctness and wrong in morality.
