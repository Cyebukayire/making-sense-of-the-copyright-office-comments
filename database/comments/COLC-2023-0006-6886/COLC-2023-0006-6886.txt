this is an extremely complex issue because on the one hand the baseline requirement (mass internet scraping) of AI art should almost certainly should be copyright infringement <br/><br/>but on the other hand the kind of regulations that would help to curb this could also very easily be used to crack down on (if not actually that at least what should be) legitimate use of popular media for fan art <br/><br/>its going to have to be a very careful balancing act to get any regulation in the goldilocks zone of protecting small independent artists
