As an independent fiction author, I find AI software to be a useful tool for editing and polishing my stories. I&#39;ve learned that AI CANNOT tell one bit of the story I want to tell. AI can&#39;t know where I want to go or find a better pathway. It&#39;s unable to use previous prose that I&#39;ve written, and successfully reference it to build a better story or the one in my mind. However, I have not come to this conclusion due to a lack of AI software not trying to build without my aid. When it creates of its own will, the output is generally superficial and uninspired, and lacking depth. However, if I ask it to proofread and polish a paragraph, then the software is able to sanitize the selection of all grammar mistakes that can be missed by humans, as well as provide suggestions that I hadn&#39;t even thought about. Even, better, if my input is illegible per se, it will mirror back what I wrote so that I can fix the selection. For me, AI is an extremely useful tool, and I hope to continue to use it for the rest of my career.  It&#39;s saving me a LOT of money. I&#39;ve thousands of dollars to have one book edited and proofread, and there are always still nagging errors in the final version. Well, AI catches those errors! I&#39;ve been using the software daily for at least two months, and I can confirm, at this juncture, it can not replace me as a story-teller because humans are storytellers; we live, and machines only know what we tell them, and then they&#39;ll have to figure out how to index that information. How many beings? How many sets of fingerprints?
