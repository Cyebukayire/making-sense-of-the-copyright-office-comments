Artificial Intelligence generated images, texts, and other content should not have the option to be copyrighted. As AI is unable to use creativity in its generation of work, all things it creates are derived from the ideas of humans who have had these original ideas. The only work put in by a human is giving the AI a prompt or asking a question - there is nothing unique enough in the process to warrant a need for copyright. The work put in is minimal, and, to put it bluntly, AI is often stealing the work of people who have not consented to their content being used for AI learning.
