AI should not be able to scrape artist&#39;s work and use it for their own functions. Have you seen the new books being released on amazon containing hazardous information regarding mushrooms? I even tested an AI bot to tell me all about a book that was just released. It was all incorrect. AI is pushing misinformation via word and pictures at an alarming rate.<br/><br/>What about when AI creates dangerous situations that cause people harm by scammers? <br/><br/>As an author, AI is endangering my job. Amazon is being flooded by AI books that are hurting my paycheck in the end. Artists have had their things scrapped without consent. <br/><br/>Support artists and authors!
