As both a voice actor and a digital illustrator, I have seen many of my peers and colleagues be negatively impacted by the sudden spike of AI generation and manipulation in artistic fields within the past year or so. Most of these issues stem from this programming being used in the place of developed skills (artistic, acting, etc.) and claimed as the equivalent of said skills instead of simply as a tool. Additionally, many of the samples taken from audio and imagery to &quot;train&quot; these algorithms are, more often than not, taken and used without the consent of the creators and source of the samples. This set of circumstances is frustrating as it is concerning, as AI-generated works that have stolen samples used in its algorithm have been either been put up for sale or used to build a portfolio of &quot;original works&quot;. <br/><br/> There are some individuals who sit on the fence in regards to the issue at hand that have commented: &quot;Well, if this technology is in the hands of people making things for fun and not a giant, wealthy corporation, it should be fine, right?&quot; Allow me to recount an example of this technology being used &quot;for fun&quot;. A few months ago, a cover of the song &quot;Welcome to the Internet&quot; featuring AI-trained samples of the character Futaba from the video game Persona 5 was released on to YouTube. Erica Lindbeck, Futaba&#39;s English voice actress and source of the samples, caught wind of this cover and asked to take it down, as it made her extremely uncomfortable to have her voice used in this manner. Instead of respectfully listening her wishes, fans of the cover lashed out at her, causing Lindbeck to respond by deleting both her Twitter and Instagram accounts, her only social media platforms. The cover in question has been presumably deleted off of YouTube after community backlash to the cause of Lindbeck&#39;s disappearance, but copies have since been re-uploaded by other users for &quot;archival sake&quot;. What occurred here was not the consequence of a corporation, profit, nor an act of spite. An independent user, instead of working with an impressionist or outright contacting Lindbeck herself, trained this AI model without permission and consent and did not adhere when they should have.<br/><br/>With the subject of AI being a source of discomfort and misery among many in creative fields, ethical use of it in those works is possible. The animation crew for the recent animated film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, designed an in-house AI tool that helped stabilize the frame rate of the animation work while numerous stylized effects that are signature to the film&#39;s art direction are happening simultaneously. It does not make the film for the animation team - it supports them, helps them in making it. In addition, what also makes this use more preferable is the fact that was was developed by the animation team, that the stabilizer was made by animators to be used for animation purposes. <br/><br/>AI is only ethical and just when it is used as a tool - when it does not replace skill, the brush, the sketch-work, the creative process itself. To reach the point where the use of ethical AI is common practice, I humbly ask the officials of the U.S. Copyright Office to push for heavy regulation of the use of AI in creative, entertainment, writing, and design fields.
