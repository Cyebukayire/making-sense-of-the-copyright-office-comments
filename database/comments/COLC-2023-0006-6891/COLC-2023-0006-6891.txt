I do not agree with people being able to copyright anything done using Artificial Intelligence. Especially generative AI. It is theft no matter how you look at it. It is stealing from artist and creators. I am an author and a Doctoral Student. I would never steal or plagiarize someone else&#39;s work. And I do not want anyone else to do it to me. Again, anything made with any kind of AI should not be allowed to be copyrighted. EVER,
