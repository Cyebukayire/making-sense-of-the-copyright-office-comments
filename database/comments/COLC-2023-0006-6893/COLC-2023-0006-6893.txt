It&#39;s like, my opinion, man, that the easiest test for the rights and responsibilities concerning AI work is to treat the AI as a &quot;person&quot;. If we are to assume that current AI methods and techniques represent a digital duplication of the process that humans use to learn, then it may be reasonable to treat it, for the purpose of such inquiries only, as &quot;human&quot;. As a human being, I have an unlimited ability to train myself on copyrighted works. As a human being, I have zero transparency as to how I use copyrighted works, and no obligations to disclose such use. Ultimately, it is up to the courts to decide whether such use is infringing. As a human being, I have copyright ownership of the things I produce; and as AI are not recognized as persons by the United States of America, such products of AI ought not be copyrightable (as the owner is not recognized as something that can copyright things).<br/><br/>I am a computer programmer, and I feel that the computer scientists working in the field are making a good faith effort to model the cognitive processes of the human mind. It would be easiest to just treat the products of these algorithmic systems as human minds.
