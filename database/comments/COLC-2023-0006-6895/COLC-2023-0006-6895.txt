I do not believe that AI should allowed when use is for marketing or selling a product of any capacity. AI has utilized stollen works of all kinds to train their algorithms which in turn allows for those works to be manipulated in a way that the creator did not intend and most likely did not want. As almost none of these creators have been properly paid in any sort of monetary way, the use of these AI shouldn&#39;t be allowed when also used for monetary gain. <br/><br/>I don&#39;t mind if people use an AI generator when they are using it for personal reasons, say when creating how a character might look in a book. It&#39;s when they then turn around and try and sell this picture of their character that this becomes an issue, because the original artwork that this character is based off of was stolen. Though the picture might not be the same, it might have a specific artists style or characterization, which in essence is taking from the artist something they could have had commissioned and been paid fair money for. The original artist is left with nother while the new creator makes money from bits and pieces of artists hard work, without any effort themselves. The same goes for written work although I know it is harder to prove. AI is like a spit in the face to creators who put a lot of time and effort and passion into a piece of art.
