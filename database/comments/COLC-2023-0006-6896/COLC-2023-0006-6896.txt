thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment.<br/><br/>i am an artist who is nervous about the future of my own career because of generative AI. <br/><br/>generative AI should not, cannot, be a substitute for an artist or writer. it should be used by the same people who perfect their craft to benefit them, not to harm them. i am against allowing generative AI to train on copyrighted works. i think authors and artists deserve not to have their work used without their permission to train these AI&#39;s, and without the proper compensation. <br/><br/>the Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>thank you for reading this comment and i hope the office takes caution when considering the livelihood of people who are already vastly underappreciated for their time and work.
