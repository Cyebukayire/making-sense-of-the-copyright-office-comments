I&#39;ve worked part-time as a freelance digital illustrator for several years in the past. In my experience, it&#39;s very difficult for digital illustrators to find work that pays well enough. For some, including myself, it&#39;s a challenge to find illustrating work that pays the equivalent of minimum wage for the amount of work done. The field of art is already notorious for not being financially lucrative enough to live off of. The last thing we need is AI taking away potential commissions. For this reason, I do not think AI-generated images should be copyrighted.
