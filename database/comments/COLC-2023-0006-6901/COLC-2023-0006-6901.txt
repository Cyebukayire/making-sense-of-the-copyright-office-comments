AI content generation is a powerful tool that may be invaluable for easing and refining the process of creating intellectual property, especially for individuals who lack the funds to compete with high-budget entities.<br/><br/>However, as it stands, all prevalent AI generation derives from existing media, algorithmically recobbled and uncredited, used without the knowledge or consent of its creators, who have, thanks to the plausible deniability of the sheer volume of works that are integrated into these processes, very little ability to recognize their stolen work in the resultant AI generated media.<br/><br/>Methods of detecting AI generated works are unreliable, returning false positives on original work, so the restrictions must be placed on the generation. The only time in which purely AI-driven media should be copyrightable is when those generating the media are doing so with a licensed library of works, in which all contributing creators are credited and compensated. If one&#39;s talent is being used to generate work, whether or not that talent is being used by them directly, they deserve compensation; in the same way that actors are paid for the use of their likenesses in derivative products.<br/><br/>Any AI-generated media produced with public domain libraries of works, whether prior to the establishment of licensed libraries or after, must not only be uncopyrightable, but also publicly available for others to use upon creation and integration into a work.<br/><br/>In terms of enforcing this, AI-generated images could possibly have a format that verifies their licensed generation OR their uncopyrightability, with harsh penalties for attempting to copyright the latter. For AI-driven writing, the matter is more complex: the idea of keeping track of everything that is ever generated with an AI, for the purposes of preventing non-transformative uses of the resultant writing, may work but seems impractical.<br/><br/>In summation, AI media generation is a new, incredible technology that should not be ignored or overly restricted. But without proper regulation, it will change from a method of supporting and empowering artists, to a factory farm of mass-produced content that shuts out opportunities for the very same artists whose content was stolen to create it.
