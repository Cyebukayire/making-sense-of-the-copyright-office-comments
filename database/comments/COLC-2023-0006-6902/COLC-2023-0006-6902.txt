Ai generated art and writing profits off of thousands of talented people who did not consent to their ideas and work being used. Whether uploading art to the internet for fun, community, or profit, the ownership of our work is still ours. AI software that &quot;scrapes&quot; the internet for images or writing to use doesn&#39;t notify or pay the artists it steals from. I truly believe these programs are just an excuse to get art for free and on demand, instead of commissioning and working with someone who&#39;s put in years of work and knowledge to hone their craft. It&#39;s sad, it&#39;s disheartening, and it tells artists that their work has no personal touch or meaning. If it can be replicated by a computer at the touch of a button, with little to no human guidance outside of a sentence or question, then why should we bother making art at all? Never mind that&#39;s it&#39;s fun, or satisfying, or a way to express yourself.
