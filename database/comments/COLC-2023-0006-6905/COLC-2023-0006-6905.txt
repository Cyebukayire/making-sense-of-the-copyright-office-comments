I stand with the National Association of Voice Actors and their stance regarding projects using a performer&#39;s likeness in the form of their voice needing to include consent, compensation, and control in order for the performance to have the proper protections needed to safeguard those artists in the future. Copyright provides these protections to a performer&#39;s work and gives them the legal framework to protect their work and their livelihood from unlawful uses. If works created through generative AI are allowed to be copyrighted, a handful of actors who believe they are getting a good deal will inevitably fail to realize what they&#39;re signing up for and agree to essentially put themselves and any future generations of actors out of a job, most likely through some kind of passive consent that wouldn&#39;t be appropriately communicated to them. There may be some fringe cases where actors train generative AI models themselves and maintain control of who licenses it and for what kinds of projects, but changing the current interpretation of cought law to include generative AI as a covered class would permit businesses with greater leverage financially to create media so fast no independent artists could compete with them from a production standpoint and artists whose likeness are used to train those models could potentially end up fighting legal battles they have no chance of winning including ones where they work on their own projects and they are sued because the performance too closely matches something made from a model of that artist&#39;s voice. I implore you to consider these potential situations as a wake-up call to stand by the decision that generative AI works so not fall under the protection of copyright law and if there ever comes a time you decide to make an exception, that exception should outline all the necessary protections for individuals such as the ones NAVA has identified. These are important and necessary aspects of a performer, their work, and even their identity. The only way to guarantee their continued protection is to keep generative AI works as an unprotected class regarding copyright law.
