As a writer I&rsquo;m very concerned about AI. It can easily assimilate anything into its own &ldquo;creation&rdquo; without actually creating anything new. It simply combines using whatever percentage of the material it has been designed to use. It doesn&rsquo;t have a life history to draw from, emotional ups and downs to color its interpretation, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to actually create anything new. My daughter is an artist and she is afraid to post her work publicly for fear that a computer program will steal her career before it has begun. Copyright should apply to a human creating a work of human art. I slave over my craft to improve, to better my work, to create something wholly original that can only come from my mind. Assimilation is not creation.
