My name is Daniel. I work as a concept artist in a AAA studio.<br/><br/>I have personal work as well as copyrighted work up on social media as well as portfolio sites.<br/><br/>I do not know what of my work has been scrapped for gen ai models like Mid Journey or Dall-e.<br/><br/>My work should be protected and not used in their models unless they seek permission to begin with. I think the companies that own these models should start fresh with free source images unless they seek permission, artist names should not be allowed in search queries or if they are with permission the artist should be compensated.<br/><br/>They are profiting from artists work freely, without permission<br/><br/>Below is an example of an ai generated image of a gun concept which even produced remnants of Bungie&rsquo;s logo in the final generated image.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s just one example of how the ai models are directly copying parts of original artists/companies images.<br/><br/>Source was found on facebook.<br/><br/>Thankyou for spending the time reading my comment!<br/><br/>Daniel<br/><br/> <br/><br/>
