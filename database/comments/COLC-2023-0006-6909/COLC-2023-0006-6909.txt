I believe the most reasonable outcome is that the copyright of AI outputs should be immediately public domain, as the material is drawn from the commons and often very private data which was never meant to be used as fuel for the corporate monopolies of creative content which copyrighting outputs would enable. Similarly, models are capable of outputting images which are extremely similar to existing works. If one allowed copyrighting those, then it would effectively allow model holders to steal the copyrights from others. Of course by the same token, making outputs public domain would also effectively nullify the copyrights of any outputs which are sufficiently similar to AI generated outputs. However, this seems overall more equitable than allowing corporations monopoly over these. If a corporation were to regenerate something similar to your art, they have significantly more legal leverage and so could even sue an artist whose work simply happens to look extremely similar to AI art. This sort of thing seems very likely over time as the amount of AI generated art grows. <br/><br/>Personally I also believe there should also be a tax on commercially used AI generated outputs, as these are pulling from the commons. It is only right that the generated value returns to the commons. At least this way the community is compensated for the value which was used.
