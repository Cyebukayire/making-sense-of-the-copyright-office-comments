Summary : If AI model indeed is creative, training without any copy righted material (but it can accept copy righted material to generate output) can be an alternative.<br/><br/>If, there is a public consensus that a model trained on copy righted material is considered &#39;creativitive&#39; instead of  &#39;stealing&#39;, I yield.<br/><br/>Otherwise, in my opinion the best way to avoid such accusation of &#39;stealing&#39; copy righted works, is it should train on materials NOT copy righted.<br/><br/>If we are creating model trained on NOT copy righted material, it better be created in a verifiable way : put together the dataset I used to train the model, perform the training, I can generate the exact model again, this allow examination for the dataset used to create the model to make sure there is no copy righted material in it.<br/><br/>It&#39;s better to enforce a model&#39;s deterministic creation, while making no guarantee that identical model should provide identical output with identical prompt, because it&#39;s unreasonable a creative model to create deterministic output.<br/><br/>If model created using data not copy righted, is performing operation using copy righted material provided by a user, the user themselves should be liable for the output it generates.<br/><br/>Because we are not requiring a model created without copy righted work to produce identical output on identical prompt, it might be difficult to see if a model is later provided with copy righted material to generate output, in order to discover this, technically we can examine these AI system (that&#39;s trained on NOT copy righted material, but can be provided with copy righted material to generate output) that their model is indeed trained with materials not copy righted with the approach described above (deterministic model creation, enables examination of dataset in training) and that their use of these &#39;clean&#39; model is not then providing copy righted materials on their own not even storing the copy righted work that other people provided to help generate output for another user and it was the user who can provide copy righted materials so it&#39;s the user who are liable.
