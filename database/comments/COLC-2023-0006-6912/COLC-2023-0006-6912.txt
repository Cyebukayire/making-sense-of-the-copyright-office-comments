As an artist and animator breaking into an industry that is already struggling to give fair pay, AI only exacerbates the problems in the entertainment industry. Artists, writers, and actors deserve credit and pay when AI uses their work--which isn&#39;t happening anytime soon. Works generated by AI should not be copyrighted. There is nothing &quot;original&quot; or &quot;creative&quot; about it. Everything made by AI steals from human creators without consent (there are even examples of AI generated art including watermarks of popular artists!) Stolen works should not be copyrighted. Theft should not be legal. Support human artists.
