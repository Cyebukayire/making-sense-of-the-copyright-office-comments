Seems like AI being able to patent art will basically make art illegal within a matter of months.. am I being dramatic here?  Patent trolls have ruined our economy, dont let them ruin our ability to dream too.  <br/><br/>I know this sounds melodramatic but pick it apart.  Make sure AI cant patent anything, ever.  The consequences are too dire and you dont need that on your soul.
