If a copyright holder uses his own copyrighted work as the sole dataset to train an AI model, then anything text generated by a thusly-trained AI bot will be copyrighted and owned by the copyright holder of the source dataset. For example, if I train a &quot;blank-slate&quot; AI bot with the text of my coprighted fiction novels and then ask the AI to write a short-story, the resulting short-story will be copyrighted under my name.
