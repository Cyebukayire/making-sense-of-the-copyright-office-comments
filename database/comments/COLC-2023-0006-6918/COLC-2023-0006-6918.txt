The purpose of copyrighting material is to protect individual originality. Since AI technology uses input from human creators, the products of this technology are nothing more than mimicry rather than original ideas. I would liken copyrighting an AI-produced artwork to taking a photo of someone else&#39;s painting, printing it on a t-shirt and then considering that t-shirt a design worthy of being copyrighted for yourself. While you could technically argue you altered that original content using alternative technology, in effect you&#39;ve only used another medium to capitalize on the creativity of the original artist and profit without their consent. This will be the result if anyone can copyright what they&#39;ve created with AI. Users of AI will create content that capitalizes on the skill and creativity of the artists or writers whose content has been milled through the AI programs. Content should only be allowed to be input through these AI programs if the original creators either approve it or have since become public domain. Anything else is not fair use of the inputted materials. It&#39;s important to make the right choices about laws around these issues now, because the tech will only get more sophisticated. But AI should be treated like a medium and not like something with its own separate rules. It&#39;s a medium similar to collage, that steals sources from elsewhere, which is only acceptable if you have consent to use those elements in a new way. It&#39;s not unlike a song that&#39;s produced with a sample from another artist. You must pay that artist to sample their work, even if what you&#39;re creating is entirely different. Once you create that new sampled song, you don&#39;t have a copyright for the content you took from another-- you only have a copyright on the aspects of the song that you created from scratch.
