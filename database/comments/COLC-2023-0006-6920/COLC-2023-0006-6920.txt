Realistically, AI needs to start over and find a way that doesn&#39;t infringe on copyright and have strict regulations instead of being a &quot;Gray Area&quot; in the copyright world. <br/><br/>At the current moment it isn&#39;t being sourced ethically. It&#39;s taking copyrighted material and telling users that it&#39;s being sourced from materials with &quot;Fair Use&quot; copyright, when that isn&#39;t the case. Some AI models have admitted to pirating ebooks off of retailers and using it to train AI, these books do not have a &quot;Fair Use&quot; copyright certificate. I&#39;ve seen several people using AI and trying to make profit off of it, and it&#39;s been later found to be plagiarising pieces of art and authors books. <br/><br/>Something needs to be done to stop this being normal and encouraged. <br/><br/>
