Just as there is a Turning Test, in which a computer is tested to see if it can successfully imitate a human, there&rsquo;s also a Turing Paradox, in which upon facing such a game, the human concedes to the computer without a fight. The problem isn&rsquo;t that computers can be as smart as humans, it&rsquo;s that too many humans won&rsquo;t bother with the struggles to actually be intelligent in such an environment. It&rsquo;s my understanding that copyright laws in part are used to encourage creativity. Any changes in copyright laws should not concede such incentives and should continue incentivize unique human qualities that can be leveraged with the use of computers.
