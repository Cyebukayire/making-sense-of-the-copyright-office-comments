Art is something humans, and some other animals, do to express themselves. What does AI have to express? Nothing. Not only are they using the works of other artists online without their consent, but they&#39;re creating soulless pieces while the &quot;creator&quot; of the piece did absolutely nothing. As an artist myself, I would be incredibly upset, infuriated, and distraught by someone using AI in such a way that it found my works and decided to try to mimic them, especially if they were to gain anything from it financially while I&#39;m sitting here unable to make any money off it. Those works I&#39;ve posted are mine, and mine alone. In my eyes, an AI using my art to generate its own should count as art theft, as the art does not belong to the AI, nor to the person generating the images, and I have not given them permission to use it in any way. Many artists feel the same way -- most of the people who support these sorts of AIs are not artists themselves and therefore don&#39;t know the stress that comes from having your art stolen. Not to mention, many artists out there do commissions to make money. If AI is available to generate art for free, that&#39;s what people will default to. These AIs actively harm artists, whether they&#39;re just hobbyists, or they&#39;re trying to make a living. How would it harm hobbyists? If an AI generates anything that looks very similar to a piece they&#39;ve created, the artist may be accused of art theft, even though they&#39;re the one who drew the piece that happens to look a lot like the generated art. This could get them banned on social media platforms and shut the door to the possibility of turning it into a job. It would also just cause undue stress knowing that their art, their own creation that they likely poured their heart and soul into, is being used by AI to generate pieces in the span of a few seconds, which undermines all the work they, the human, put into their work. That&#39;s discouraging and can cause people to put down art and never come back to it. Now they have one less thing they like to do, and one less outlet to express their emotions and ideas. With the prevalence of mental illnesses like depression and anxiety in this country, that&#39;s incredibly detrimental. With depression in particular, one of the biggest things you need are hobbies you enjoy doing. This would take the enjoyment out of it. With anxiety, it would cause them to be very afraid of their art essentially getting stolen by AI and could lead to them not making art and/or refusing to post it. What&#39;s the point of expressing yourself if you can&#39;t share it with people? AI shouldn&#39;t be allowed to just take anyone&#39;s art and use it to make a lifeless piece for someone for free just because they didn&#39;t want to make it themselves or commission someone else to do it. This will only cause more harm to artists, regardless of whether or not they themselves gain anything from their own art financially.
