AI is predicated on the theft of other people&rsquo;s works, and therefore should not be allowed to be copyrighted. There is little to no ability to reasonably trace a source, let alone give attribution, which is what would be expected of other derivative works. I believe its practices extend beyond reasonable fair use and it deserves strenuous regulation as a result.
