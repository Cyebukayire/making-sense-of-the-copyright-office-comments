AI has already significantly damaged many incomes and careers. In my opinion, all AI datasets (the material an AI is trained on) should be: 1 -&gt; Easily indexed and searchable. 2 -&gt; Referenced professionals whose content is scraped should HAVE to opt in and license that training material. AI Art, Writing, and Code should NOT be copyrightable unless it is ethically licensed and sourced, period. <br/><br/>I believe that the copyright office should require proof of licensing prior to copyrighting any AI work. Period.
