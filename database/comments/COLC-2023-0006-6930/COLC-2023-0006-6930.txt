I believe that AI should not be copyrighted. AI scrapes art and writing from unwilling participants to create things. AI users lack creativity and do not deserve to have their work copyrighted. All they do is type in a prompt and have a program spit out something using assets ground on the internet. Often times these assets are copyrighted works themselves. The creators of these assets never consented to their works being used in this way. As a creative, I fear that I will lose potential customers to AI.
