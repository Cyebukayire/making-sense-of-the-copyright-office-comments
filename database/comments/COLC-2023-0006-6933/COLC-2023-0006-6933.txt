To my knowledge, no content created using AI is copyrightable because every generative AI system is created using copyrighted materials in the first place. For now, every AI is breaching current copyright laws.<br/>To keep this technology legal, we need to control and enforce the current laws, to prevent AI from being &quot;fed&quot; materials behind the back of the original creators of said materials.<br/>We need enforced transparency.
