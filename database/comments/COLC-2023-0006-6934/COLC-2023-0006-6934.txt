I am working at a game company to draw illustrations. I used to work on painting, but now I work on editing ai images. After the ai came out, the team members&#39; paintings were fed to the ai. And they cut down on the number of people. Now, I just modify the picture that ai made. I&#39;m making a living modifying the fake of the painting that my colleagues and I made, but I don&#39;t know how long I can do it.Please stop millionaires stealing paintings from poor writers to become richer
