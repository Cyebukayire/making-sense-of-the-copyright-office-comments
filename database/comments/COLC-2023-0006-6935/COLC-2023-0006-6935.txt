I believe that Artificial Intelligence as it currently stands is a major infringement on an individual&#39;s copyright and it needs to be regulated immediately. The artists and creatives whose work has been used, without their consent, to build these AI platforms need to have some sort of retribution for having their work, their styles, and even their ways of writing fed into these machines.<br/><br/>Imagine, if you will, going to the Louvre Museum, taking photos of all those famous works of art, and then cutting up those photos and turning them into a collage. You wouldn&#39;t say &quot;I made every single one of these masterpieces that I used in this collage&quot;. You&#39;d say that you &quot;took these iconic pieces by master artisans and assembled them into a collage&quot;. That is where AI becomes harmful to creatives. It has taken all those photos and turned them into a collage, but instead of saying &quot;the images in this work were created by these artisans&quot;, it claims that the work is entirely &quot;original&quot;, made only by it&#39;s robot brain. But in reality, that robot brain is just piecing together images and information it&#39;s been fed. It has stolen the work of others and claimed that it owns it. And the users working with AI then take this ownership for themselves, claiming that they fed a prompt into a AI generator and created a masterpiece all by themselves. That masterpiece would not exist without the original art that had been stolen from the artists and fed into the AI.<br/><br/>Creatives are already voicing how disheartening this whole situation has been. Companies have been firing creatives and replacing their jobs with AI. Artists&#39; works are still be stolen daily and fed into AI without their permission. Some AI platforms will even mimic a specific artist&#39;s style. And what&#39;s worse is that the AI platforms then charge a fee for these services. So not only are they taking jobs from the creatives, but they&#39;re also stealing any potential income the artists could&#39;ve gotten from their work by creating a horrible copy of what they&#39;d already made. Many creatives have stopped sharing their works online now because it&#39;s no longer safe for artists to post images anywhere. We are on the verge of losing the creativity that makes humanity beautiful and unique. <br/><br/>And this doesn&#39;t just apply to paintings. Everything around you is designed by an artist. The layout of the roads you drive, the signs on the highway, the design of your email and webpages, the construction of your furniture, the advertisements you see, the movies and shows you watch, the design of your coffee maker, the building you&#39;re in; literally everything in our society was built by teams of creatives doing what they love. And AI is already wearing down the creative force and making it harder for artists to keep doing what they love.<br/><br/>Now there are ways that we can make AI more fair to everyone without completely abolishing it. It does have the potential to create amazing things. But for it to be fair to creatives, AI needs to be a voluntary submission of works and to offer the creatives royalties when their work is used by someone. The current AI platforms that are built on stolen works need to be completely erased and possibly sued for massive amounts of art theft, copyright infringement, and violating all the major studio&#39;s non-disclosure agreements, like certain companies did when they started gathering images for their AI from their Cloud without asking user permission.<br/><br/>But with the old AI cleared, we could reestablish AI platforms and have them built solely on voluntary information. We could give creatives the right to chose how their work is used, or if it&#39;s even used at all. And offer those same creatives incentives and royalties when they submit their work to the AI. We could allow them to see how their work was used, include their name as a credit to the work that was created using their art, maintain their original copyright to their work, and even give them a percentage of the AI fee each time their art is used by someone through the platforms. This is the only way that AI will ever be fair to creatives and the people who still want to use AI.<br/><br/>So, in summary, Artificial Intelligence programs as they stand need to be abolished for massive amounts of copyright infringement. They continue to steal data and images to grow their platforms without any sort of legal action being taken against the thefts and infringements. If it&#39;s not regulated soon, we will lose the human touch that makes the world so wonderful and unique and that has created masterpieces throughout the centuries.<br/><br/>Please help regulate AI so that it can be fair to everyone!<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
