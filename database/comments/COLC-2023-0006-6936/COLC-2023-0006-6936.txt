I do not believe that ANY AI work should be allowed to be copyrighted, as AI art of any kind is purely based off directly copying a large set of pre-produced work, without any sort of thought and passion put into it. It&#39;s basing everything it makes on mostly stolen art, and voices in the case of voice actors.
