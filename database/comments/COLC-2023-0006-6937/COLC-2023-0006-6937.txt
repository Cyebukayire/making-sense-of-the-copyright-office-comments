I do not think AI should be used in anyway be it voice, acting, dancing, art of any kind unless proven person has a disability to do so for artwork only. Not for extras, not in businesses or for phone calls, chats online, etc ... None of it. It takes jobs away from actual people who aren&#39;t properly paid as it is. Pay the employees for the work they do and actually deserve. Problem solved.
