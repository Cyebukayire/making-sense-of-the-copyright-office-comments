AI created content (writing, visual, audio, etc.) should not be subject to copyright. Since AI is scraping available information and content from previously created works, the amalgamation of those works should not be able to be claimed and protected under copyright. <br/><br/>AI should also not be able to scrape information from copyrighted materials - all personal works, intellectual property, and works of art should be protected from being captured and repurposed by AI. <br/><br/>We need to protect the works of individuals, corporations, and creators from having their work consumed and regurgitated by AI programs.
