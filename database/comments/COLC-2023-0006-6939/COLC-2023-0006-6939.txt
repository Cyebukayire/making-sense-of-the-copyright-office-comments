I believe AI has the potential to be an incredible tool, but it is not right if it is being trained off of material taken from creators without their consent. It is not right that individuals such as actors are being asked to sign away the rights to their likeness so that companies can create digital models of them to be used indefinitely while only paying them once. It is not right that business decisions are being made from models trained off of data inherently plagued by social biases that society does not want to perpetuate such as rasism, misogyny, and ablism. The ethical and legal implications of AI have not been considered enough prior to releasing these tools into the unregulated wild. I hope you will consider the best interests of humans in this great country when making decisions regarding this issue. Government by the people, for the people includes everyone, not just those at the top who stand to profit most off the exploitation of those beneath them and new technologies.
