Since AIs are often trained on works without the express permission of the original creator, it would be inappropriate for any works generated off that training set to be eligible for copyright without recompense for the original creators who did not consent to their work being used. <br/><br/>If the original creator is unknown (if the data set was anonymized), deceased and no permission from their estate, or does not approve, then anything generated by the dataset containing such data should not be eligible for copyright.<br/><br/>Additionally, AI works are often used for commercial purposes and thus should not qualify as Fair Use.
