The output of any AI (i.e. any machine-learning process) should not be copyrighted. The principle of copyright is intended to protect the work of a creator -- an artist, a writer, etc. The tools we call AI are not creators. They are machine processes, no different from the work of a screensaver or a copy machine. As a writer, I might type on my keyboard with my eyes closed and see if an interesting set of words or syllables emerges; this doesn&#39;t mean my keyboard should get a copyright on what came out. <br/><br/>Also, if I write something that uses substantial portions of someone else&#39;s previous work, I&#39;ve engaged in plagiarism and copyright violation. AI tools by their nature are continually committing this kind of plagiarism. Complex theft is still theft. Under no circumstances should the work of an AI be considered copyrightable.
