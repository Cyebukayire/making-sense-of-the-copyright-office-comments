AI/Program-generated content should not be possible to copyright, because it itself requires little to no human input at all, while simultaneously relying entirely on stolen and plagiarized human-created content. The programs don&#39;t actually create anything original, they only take images and text they&#39;ve been fed and mash them together with no genuine thought or consideration (as they are only programs). Allowing the copyright of such &quot;creations&quot; will only benefit amoral thieves and hurt real, human artists. And as that hypothetically continues, more and more content in the public space would be artificially generated, leading to those programs &quot;learning&quot; off of each other, creating a uniform, featureless stew of meaningless &quot;art&quot;. Copyrighting program-generated content benefits no-one but the laziest, sleaziest of people, who only want to profit off the backs of real artists with real visions and and creative dreams.<br/><br/>Again, these programs don&#39;t &quot;create&quot; anything. They slap together colors and words to the best of their ability. There is no thought behind their &quot;creations&quot;, there is no artistic vision, there is no desire to add something to the world. Someone who gives a program a prompt to &quot;create&quot; something is essentially asking someone else to do their work for them, except there is no one else. Programs are not people. Giving them and/or the people who use them the same rights as genuine creators will do nothing but hurt American -- and global -- culture.<br/><br/>Art is an innately human thing. We&#39;ve been doing it for tens of thousands of years -- from painting on cave walls, to molding the very earth to create huge murals of stone and earth, to music, to stories that fill pages upon pages -- and it is one of many constants for our species. People will always create, because it is in our nature.<br/><br/>Art and text programs don&#39;t do it out of love, or anything else. They do it because they were programmed to, by people with no creativity of their own, to benefit off the work of others. Nothing new can ever come out of these programs, because they can only mash together what already exists. Basically, they&#39;re copy-pasting anything mostly similar to the prompt they were given. Real human artists can create something new. Real human artists can create something worth protecting with copyright. By allowing program-generated content to be copyrighted, that&#39;s essentially giving a programmer the right to copyright someone else&#39;s work. That would open so many loopholes in copyright, and create a storm of headaches for anyone trying to create, and for anyone working in copyright and copyright law.<br/><br/>Save everyone&#39;s time and mental health, and just don&#39;t allow it to be copyrighted in the first place, and make it clear to these programmers and the people who use these programs that they are only novelties. Pressure the programmers to be completely transparent about where the source material for their programs&#39; outputs comes from, and ENSURE the original creators of that source material have all knowingly given their consent for it to be used in that way. There can be genuine uses for program-generated content, but don&#39;t let it overextend into the realm of real human artists trying to add something to this world.
