AI is ruining art! AI doesn&#39;t have feelings, emotions, experiences, performance, target audiences, mistakes, humor, nuance, NOTHING necessary to create real art! Humans are essential to the entertainment industry. SAG-AFTRA and WGA wouldn&#39;t be striking if that wasn&#39;t true! AI can only create a SHELL of what a human can. We all know this already but I am ANGRY about it!
