Pattern Recognition Programs, generally referred to as &ldquo;AI,&rdquo; are harmful because they generate text and other media by scraping and copying other media on the internet, with no regard to the legal status of what they steal from. What it generates is also not created by the person who entered in the prompt. If person A tells person B to write a book with X, Y, and Z, and person B writes a book with X, Y, and Z, then person B wrote the book not person A. At the bare minimum, &ldquo;AI&rdquo; generated media should have no legal protections.
