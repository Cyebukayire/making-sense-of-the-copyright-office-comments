AI does not create originial work.  It takes the work of others &amp; mixes it together until there is something different.  Why should you be able to copyright something as yours if the only hand you had in making it was telling an AI what to do, and letting it mix together the work of people who, in some cases, haven&#39;t even consented to their work being scraped and used to train AI?
