It&#39;s simple: Much like sound libraries or stock photos, you need permission from the people who made and own those media if you want to use them for yourself.<br/><br/>If a company wants to use thousands of images created by others in order to make a product, in this case an algorithm that generates similar images, they should be required to obtain permission for those images, as they already are. <br/><br/>Not only should machine-generated content not be copyrightable, it should not be able to be made without being approved by those whose creative and copyrighted work would be used to produce it.
