I&#39;m a normal person that we as a society have completely lost the plot when it comes to having AI make creative pieces of art (literature, music, digital and physical paintings). Our forefathers dreamt of a world in which AI took away physical jobs from people so we could engage in creative processes full time. NOT to have AI make our creative works so  nothing can distract us from our menial jobs. That, and with how scarily accurate this technology has gotten in mimicking people in just a few short years, the entire field is ripe in false information. Imagine not being able to trust ANYTHING distributed digitally because of this technology. Only what someone sees in front of them. These &quot;innovators&quot; looked at every unsubtle plot device in fiction at how dystopic our world has gotten and decided that&#39;s what we need today.
