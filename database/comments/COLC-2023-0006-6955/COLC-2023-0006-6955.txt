While the code used to produce AI should be protected by copyright, the materials subsequently generated by AI are the result of the visual or text databases entered into the program, and thus of those original creators, not of the AI itself. It should therefore not be protected by copyright. In all its current forms, AI cannot invent, but merely generate responses that take the average, or most likely, outcome based on its data. This is not creation, but cataloging and reorganizing. The producers of these programs cannot take credit for the copyrighted material they are scraping from the internet and cannot claim creative ownership of the hodgepodge of ideas that the computer unthinkingly spits out. The very term AI, &ldquo;artificial INTELLIGENCE&rdquo; is designed to make users believe that thinking is occurring. It is not and without thought there can be no reason to protect INTELLECTUAL property.
