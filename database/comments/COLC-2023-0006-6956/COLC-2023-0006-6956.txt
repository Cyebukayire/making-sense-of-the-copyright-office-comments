The current working &ldquo;AI&rdquo; models have all been &ldquo;trained&rdquo; on artistic (visual and written) content without the consent or knowledge of the individual artist, author, or copyright holder. Expressed permission should be obtained before using a person&rsquo;s copyrighted work to train an AI. No AI model that I have encountered exists in a way that is not in infringement of a copyright holder&rsquo;s right to consent. It is my opinion that AI trained this way should be obligated to start over training their models, only with works they have explicit consent to use. These AI models are also not true intelligence. They do not have the ability to spontaneously create, to be inspired, only to collect inputs based upon a prompt, much like a calculator. As such, I do not believe work created by an AI should be classified as &ldquo;art&rdquo; and should not be viable for copyright for the person who entered the prompt into the machine. AI, as it exists, should be classified as a tool for artists and authors, not as a means of independently creating artistic works.
