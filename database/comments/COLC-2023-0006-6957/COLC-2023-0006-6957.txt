AI and generative technologies are currently trying to build their base processes via unethical means and should be heavily regulated. I do not think anything AI created should be allowed to be copy-written or trademarked unless it is created by a company that has trained its own AI on its own already owned and copy-written works (e.g., a video game company creating new tools to help their artists be more efficient in a way that does not harm the skillset or employability of their artists or writers, and those newly created tools are trained on work already owned and created by that video game company). The burden of proof would need to be on the companies requesting the copyright to prove that their work was created ethically. I am not sure how much effort the U.S. Copyright Office wants to put into drafting regulations as such, but it is the &quot;middle ground&quot; that I can see rather than a black and white parity of yes or no. <br/><br/>But otherwise, I think the question of whether or not AI generated works should be allowed to claim copyright is no. They should not be.<br/><br/>AI is only as good as the data in, and right now it is a muddy free-for-all of misinformation and bias. People seem to think that AI can magically generate things for them, but this is not the case. Written works routinely have many errors, and there has been evidence of AI tech like stable diffusion scraping medical images without consent to use in its prompts which can cause harm to the individuals who did not agree for their likeness to pop up in these things and then to be potentially included in a copyright request is a horrifying prospect.
