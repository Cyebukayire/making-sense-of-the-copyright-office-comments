Given the potential for abuse, plagiarism, and theft from human artists, whose works are used to train AIs that will inevitably be used by greedy corporations to try to force humans out of their jobs and replace their hard work with lower-quality AI plagiarisms, I would be firmly in favor of AI-generated works being classified as non-copyrightable.
