As a photographer, graphic designer, author, and model who has worked hard to establish themselves as both a professional and ethical brand, it is disheartening to see a fundamental shift in not only copyright motives and protection, but also a landscape where generative AI has made is all but impossible for registered trademark holders like myself to maintain control over our marks. Seeing silence from large entities like movie studios who are allowing their IP to be degraded and diluted by generative AI companies and users, we stand on a knife&#39;s edge wherein the real threat of toppling to our creative demise is a very near. <br/><br/>It is my hope the USCO does not recind their current guidance on AI generated works and copyright, as creatives everywhere who value ethics, integrity and most of all hard work and true talent need all the help we can get. <br/><br/>I have attached a copy of a generative AI ethics course I recently created and presented for free. It is my hope this helps, along with other commenters, to establish ongoing protections.
