Thank you for consulting for public comment on this policy, and a special thank you for extending the invitation internationally given that the consequences of United States legal decisions tend to create sweeping changes across the rest of the world.<br/><br/>My comment is free-form, as I am sure others more far qualified in this field than myself will have comprehensively answered the specific point-by-point questions outlined in this request.<br/><br/>The current default reading of US intellectual property law with regards to model training is simple and sane: Training data is fair use, a trained model is fair use, but the output of a trained model may be assessed on a case-by-case basis for copyright infringement. The legal framework required for this reading of the law requires nothing more than accommodating for the existence of a new creative tool. This is good, and it already works without any changes to copyright law. It is aligned both with the principle to &quot;promote the progress of science and the useful arts&quot; and with protecting intellectual property interests of authors who may pursue claims against unfair competition from such works as are actually shown to be in violation of their own copyright. A post-AI creative environment governed by the current default reading is a vibrant, promising future for arts and culture where the centers of creative production are massively distributed.<br/><br/>But to rule otherwise opens up a far more dangerous, creator-hostile legal and market environment: The new means of production will exist regardless of the answer to the main question before today&#39;s courts, but in the alternative ruling in which models themselves are considered in violation of copyright if their training data touches anything copyrightable, various very negative effects will follow:<br/>- AI tools will still come to dominate the creative industry, but under total corporate control of a handful of already massive global media conglomerates. Instead of a decentralized and vibrant creator-centric future, this would result in an industry with more concentrated power in fewer hands, with fewer humans having the opportunity for creative expression. Companies with small individually licensed datasets would be unlikely to be able to compete with models created by corporations with large portfolios of works-for-hire, or with stock image companies that license massive archives of images.<br/>- Without protections for open models and AI model industry competition, creators in various sectors displaced by AI tools will find themselves with no equivalent tools to compete with in turn. No ongoing royalty scheme could begin to compensate for the lack of commercially viable means of creation in such a legally monopolized market condition.<br/>- Without protections from mandatory licensing schemes, the terms of service of commercial AI models would likely begin to lay claim to creative expressions derived from their tools, further entrenching their already powerful positions.<br/>- An inverted burden of proof will create a more hostile copyright environment in the remaining niches for human artists, as large copyright holders will gain an effective monopoly on all creative tools trained on their works, but on abstract ideas themselves; It would become trivial for a copyright holder to issue frivolous lawsuits against individual creators on the unrealistic basis that the defendant must prove their work was not somehow derived from a tool tainted by their copyright, and trivial to fabricate evidence that it could have been.<br/>- There may be unexpected knock-on effects on other industries: For instance, it may be impossible to create realistic training data for self-driving vehicles if automotive companies enforce copyrights of their vehicle&#39;s designs, resulting in an unfair advantage to a minority of companies in this area as well as endangerment of the general public if models are only trained in conditions that don&#39;t match the real world. A wide variety of computer vision systems may be impossible to train if every dataset photograph must be individually licensed from the public.<br/>- Under conglomerated corporate control, the creative freedom of expression in a post-AI creative industry will the severely curtailed to the range of creative expression allowed by a handful of creative industry conglomerates.<br/><br/>The latter future is a disaster in the making. I urge the copyright office to tread the path of least resistance, and to allow existing precedent to govern this field.<br/><br/>I will conclude with a quote from a speech by Thomas Babington Macaulay in 1841,<br/>&quot;The wholesome copyright which now exists will share in the disgrace and danger of the new copyright which you are about to create. And you will find that, in attempting to impose unreasonable restraints on the reprinting of the works of the dead, you have, to a great extent, annulled those restraints which now prevent men from pillaging and defrauding the living.&quot;
