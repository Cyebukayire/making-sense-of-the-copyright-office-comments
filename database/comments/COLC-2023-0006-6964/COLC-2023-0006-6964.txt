I am just a civilian, but I am deeply concerned about &quot;AI&quot; (which is of course a misnomer). I write free fiction on a popular website, and I have recently made all of my work available only to users because I am concerned about bots scrubbing my work for machine learning, which would be theft of my Creative Commons work, since they would not credit it. It would just go into a big nameless pile of data for the &quot;AI&quot; to pull from. <br/><br/>We have not yet come to the point where true Artificial Intelligence exists. Perhaps someday, there will be computers who are actually people, and this question will need to be revisted. But a Person creates because they want to, not because someone else pushes a button and tells them to pull relevant data and arrange it in a pleasing way. Neither the button-pusher nor the computer program has created anything, therefore the work should not be eligible for copyright. That one monkey who took a selfie is more eligible than an &quot;AI&quot; is (and I&#39;m not saying the monkey should be eligible, I&#39;m just saying it would make more sense to grant  it to the monkey). At least the monkey actually wanted to play with the weird human toy, which resulted in a photo, as compared to a computer program scubbing words and images that it got from the internet without thinking about it (because AI is not yet at the point where it can think for itself).<br/><br/>Also, you guys have a reCaptcha that made me confirm that I&#39;m not a robot before I could submit this. Why would you consider granting copyright to a robot but not letting one fill out this form? It&#39;s because robots aren&#39;t people. And you can&#39;t give copyright to something that isn&rsquo;t a person.
