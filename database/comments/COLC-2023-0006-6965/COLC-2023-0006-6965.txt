Works where the majority of the content being presented is generated by an AI should not be eligible for copyright. However, I think its incredibly important to make the distinction of &quot;a majority of content is produced by AI&quot;. With tools like Photoshop adding AI tools to their kit, it may end up being impossible to determine if absolutely 0 AI was used in the production of a work. Artists deserve compensation and are entitled to their own works, but if we let AI generated material get copyright protection, large corporations will be able to just generate millions of copyrighted artworks every day, and claim anyone who is vaguely similar to this spattered mess of hog shit they threw out.
