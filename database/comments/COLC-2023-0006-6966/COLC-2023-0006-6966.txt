I&rsquo;m personally very concerned about unregulated AI use, for the harm it can cause copyright holders and working creatives. Copyright holders have little to no form of recourse to AI infringement and creativity is actively harmed if people are concerned about their words and creations being stolen without acknowledgement. I would like it if there were regulations in place.
