Hello,<br/><br/>As an artist, I believe it would set a dangerous precedent to declare images, audio, video, writing, or any other form of material generated by tools commonly referred to as &quot;AI&quot; as protected under copyright. Copyright law exists to protect artists and to ensure they are able to make a living off of their work. AI tools are not people, and the images they generate make it actively difficult for people to find work in their chosen profession. In addition, most currently available AI tools have been created by using the work of artists without their permission, effectively violating current copyright law to begin with. <br/><br/>Without significant, clearly discernible human alteration and augmentation, no work created primarily with AI tools should be protected by the laws created to ensure human effort and ingenuity are safeguarded. These tools, in their current form, exist to undermine people, not empower them, and any government that cannot recognize this is one that is unjust.
