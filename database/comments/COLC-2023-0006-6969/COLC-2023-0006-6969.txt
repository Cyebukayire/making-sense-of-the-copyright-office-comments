As a published author, I find the notion that my work is being used without my or my publisher&rsquo;s consent as grist for someone&rsquo;s generative AI to be profoundly offensive, as well as a violation of my authorial rights and my publisher&rsquo;s copyright. This is more than simple discourtesy: it is theft, plain and simple.
