In my discussions with various people on the subject of AI and copyright, I&#39;ve noticed a common pattern that the supporters of broad application of copyright law to restrict the training material AI systems are allowed to use tend to view copyright as a natural, inalienable right that authors possess, and that any use of an author&#39;s work beyond what they explicitly allow is immoral.<br/><br/>I would like to point out that this is not the way the U.S. Constitution views the issue. Rather, copyright was created for a specific, limited purpose: &quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot;, and its scope is intentionally restricted to &quot;limited Times&quot;. (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8.)<br/><br/>Therefore, when considering how to apply copyright law to generative AI I would urge the U.S. Copyright Office to do so with those principles in mind. Generative AI is an excellent example of &quot;the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot;, and any legislative or regulatory steps taken should be structured in such a way as to promote its development, not hinder it.<br/><br/>Generative AI is a disruptive technology, and disruptive technologies have a tendency to generate strong opposition from the industries they are disrupting. The Copyright Office ought not to take sides on that issue, and instead should focus on upholding the original purpose of copyright as defined by the Constitution.
