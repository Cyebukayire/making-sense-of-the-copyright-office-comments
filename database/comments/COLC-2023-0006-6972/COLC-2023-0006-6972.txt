Hello, I am a working illustrator. AI is trained on copyrighted images that are taken and used without consent. There is currently no way to regulate this, and making AI images copyrightable would be allowing other copyrighted work to be used and profited off of illegally. The legal precedent on AI work has not been explicitly created yet, and you have the ability to take a definitive stance on the side of working artists who already struggle in a competitive and underpaid field. Creating a legal precedent for our work to be stolen and profited off of is unethical and antithetical to the purpose of copyright. Please consider this opinion when deciding whether or not to make AI generated images copyrightable.
