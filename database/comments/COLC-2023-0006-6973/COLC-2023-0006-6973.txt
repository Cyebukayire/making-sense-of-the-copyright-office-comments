We need far stricter policy around the usage of AI, particularly in artistic endeavors.<br/><br/>Artists of all kinds exist within an oversaturated market with few opportunities for significant career advancement. These are hard-working and passionate people who are often barely scraping back without an influx of competition that required nothing more than a few clicks of a mouse. Additionally, the artist should be entitled to all works they have created without giving express permission to another entity to make use of/derive profit from said work.<br/><br/>In the case of the entertainment industry, the issues with AI are particularly grotesque -- it should never be possible to own someone else&#39;s likeness or to incentivize profit from someone else&#39;s likeness. Allowing this sort of ownership opens the gates for violations of privacy and bodily autonomy, as well as exposing the victim&#39;s public reputation to risk. If we allow ownership of likenesses, we encourage non-consenting pornographic recreations and deepfakes with political agendas, with both topics having a notable impact on people across the political aisle.<br/><br/>There are, of course, some use cases that can appear beneficial -- such as the use of AI on existing cookbooks to generate recommendations for those with unusual dietary restrictions. I feel it is important to protect copyrighted material even in use cases such as these -- those wanting to craft such a program/collection could instead start from scratch or from family recipes to train AI. There are also often hidden drawbacks to the use of AI (in this example, how easy would it be for AI not to account for the way cooking a food changes its chemical makeup and therefore nutritional value?) that should be remembered even when the surface-level arguments provide a &quot;feel-good&quot; angle.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
