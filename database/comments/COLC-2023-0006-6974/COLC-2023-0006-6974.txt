Hello, I am an artist and illustrator who is very much invested in this decision regarding copyright in &quot;AI art&quot;. My comment is twofold, the first being that &quot;AI&quot; is not an accurate descriptor for tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E,and others. This technology is generative, and has no inherent intelligence- it works - in the case of ChatGPT as an advanced text predictor. It will fill in the blanks of what it predicts is the next most likely word. In the case of AI art, it used datasets given to it and mashed up the images in a similar way, remixing images in the most likely, or most often seen configuration. The reason for this aside is that calling this technology &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; gives it more credit, weight, and gravity than what is actually happening. With this veneer of human intelligence, it is easier to make the argument that all things generated by it are unique or original, when in reality it is mindless, soulless configurations of other people&#39;s work. <br/><br/>It is not fair to the countless artists, writers, and creatives to have our work taken without permission and claimed as new with no credit whatsoever. Asking google to do a search, or Firefly, or Midjourney to return a search result or to create a prompt you have given it is not creation. And those claiming to have &quot;made&quot; original artwork with these programs are simply stealing.<br/><br/>Requiring AI &quot;art&quot; to not be copyrighted is a necessity in my opinion, there must be a clear statement that the art used is trained on the world of real, human artists. The art in question MUST be referenced- just as you would reference a source in a paper- and credit must be given to the original creators. Additionally, permission must be requested by the original artists to use their work. <br/><br/>Whether it is an opt-in on a website that trains AI, or an explicit request that requires a signature and approval.<br/><br/>I have lost work to this new phenomenon, I have seen the work of peers used against their will, and without credit, in AI works. It is unethical and deeply unfair that those who are to afraid to create on their own will stand on the shoulder&#39;s of others and claim to have gotten there on their own. We are a community, and everyone deserves credit for their work.<br/><br/>Thank you.
