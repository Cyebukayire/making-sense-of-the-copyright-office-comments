I always found that work is split into 2 Catagories. <br/><br/>A. Work that helps us live<br/>B. Work that we live for<br/><br/>With A.I. attacking B I think we may have gone into a dangerous territory as a species. <br/><br/>On the front of AI stealing art many techbros will say that artists use references all the time. The key difference is that no 2 artists or human at all see the reference the same way, we all have a different filter of how we see the world, it&#39;s why we may fall in love with someone we consider the one.
