There are deeper issues. An online campaign &ndash; #NotoAIArt &ndash; has seen artists sharing concerns about the legality of AI image generators, and about how they have the potential to devalue the skill of illustration. To create images from prompts, AI generators rely on databases of already existing art and text. These comprise billions of images that have been scraped from the internet. Among the biggest is the open-source LAION-5B dataset, used by DDG&rsquo;s Text 2 Dream. Kaloyan Chernev, founder of DDG, says that the dataset comprises &ldquo;largely public domain images sourced from the internet&rdquo;, but many artists and illustrators say that databases will often also include a lot of copyrighted images.<br/><br/>Basically, AI art companies are essentially stealing art from actual artists and profiting from their work. They do NOT, repeat not deserve ANY protection from copyright laws whatsoever cause they are frequently and rampantly misusing said laws. Ergo, they should NOT be protected, cause doing so promotes theft.
