AI is NOT the future of creative endeavors especially. It should not be able to be copy written. It was not created by a human, and robots don&#39;t have rights to property. It will destroy what&#39;s left of the art world and make it impossible for anyone to actually be a creator. This should be used to replace us in dangerous factory jobs, not art and definitely not copywritten. It&#39;s not real.
