Re: Copyright Office [Docket No. 2023-6] Artificial Intelligence and Copyright I am making this submission on behalf of myself.<br/>General Questions: Question 34<br/>Answer,<br/><br/>As mentioned in court filing such as the so called Sarah Silverman v openAI case, (https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/9/23788741/sarah-silverman-openai-meta-chatgpt-llama-copyright-infringement-chatbots-artificial-intelligence-ai) The data used to train AI systems had been unlawfully accessed.<br/><br/>Pirated books were used for training. There is no &quot;fair use&quot; exception for this. Not even researchers can use pirated data for research. It has to be lawful accessed. Datasets are full of unlawfully accessed data. This alone should negate any chance of AI outputs being copyrightable. (US17 &sect;103a) US Copyright Office Guidance, Circular 14, page 2. Right to make derivative works. In no case shall copyright extend to any work where copyrighted works are used unlawfully.
