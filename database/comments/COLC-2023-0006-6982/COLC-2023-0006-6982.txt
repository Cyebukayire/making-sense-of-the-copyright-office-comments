As a freelance writer recently entering the market, I&#39;ve noticed a disturbing trend since AI systems have taken off: workers are being laid off, losing work, and being replaced. We&#39;re losing jobs to technology that has scraped the words of writers who came before, essentially reusing and repurposing copywritten works without paying for them. AI is a useful tool that&#39;s worth carefully researching and expanding upon, but the profit being concentrated into giant corporations who have harvested the works of others is a grave injustice.<br/><br/>If I take an apart a bunch of iPhones, shake all the pieces around in a bag, and sell those bags of pieces to customers, am I actually creating an original product? This is the way that AI has taken and used the words of others to create their systems.
