Generative AI, as it is currently used, breaches copyright law regularly by training algorithms on copyrighted work without licensing or agreements from the copyright holders. There is currently nothing in the law stopping someone from dumping hours of video footage or thousands of images from artists, directors, or actors, in an effort to replicate and replace their work. Not cracking down or regulating what can be used to train AI models leaves the door open to mass fraud, deepfakes, and essentially removes all copyright protections that exist in the country.<br/><br/>As an artist, this represents not only an existential threat to my livelihood, but also makes it incredibly difficult to claim copyright infringement without legal precedent. An individual or group could take my work and add it to a model without me even knowing it to generate content they did not create themselves. The very thing that makes works available under Fair Use is the idea that the work has to be transformative, and generative AI is exactly the opposite. It takes work the user did not make and generates new content without any meaningful input by the user aside from clicking a single button. With current bot technology, AI users don&#39;t even have to pick what the AI trains on by hand, as they can simple program bots to scour websites for content to steal.<br/><br/>Generative AI is blatant theft and copyright infringement and I hope the copyright office amends its policies to view it as such.
