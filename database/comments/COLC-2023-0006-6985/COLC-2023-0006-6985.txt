Let&#39;s be clear: the growing rise in AI technology is fueled entirely by the media industry&#39;s desire to cut costs by removing the human element from their products.<br/><br/>AI is trained by broadly consuming massive amounts of images and text on the Internet, none of which is authorized by its creators for this specific use.<br/><br/>A program written by a human to draw a picture if you tell it &quot;draw a picture&quot; is copyrightable; the picture that results is not, in the same way that if my car leaks, the pattern of oil left on the pavement is not copyrightable&mdash;even if I punch a hole in the gas tank myself.<br/><br/>AI hurts artists, who are people.  If I owned a media company, imagine how much money I could save if I fired all my writers and artists, and just told this code to make a new animated feature every day!  Enough people will buy that I&#39;ll profit from it, and it doesn&#39;t hurt anyone&mdash;except for the hundreds of creators on my staff, and, what&#39;s more, the general public, who are bein trained to consume heartless products rather than embrace impactful art.<br/><br/>An AI program is not a human, it cannot hold a copyright.<br/><br/>The growing trend of AI is a detriment to every single aspect of society; the indisputable goal of this technology is for business owners to increase profit by reducing wages and eliminating human staff.  This harms everyone: the staff that are fired, the people who consume mindless junk rather than intellectually stimulating or emotionally powerful media, and future generations who might strive to pursue art and create beauty and meaning, only to be completely stifled by an uncaring capitalistic world.<br/><br/>The bare minimum is to disallow AI creations to be copyrightable.  A business owner with an AI program has no qualms training it on Jane Doe&#39;s fan fiction or Johnny Smith&#39;s Twitter artwork.  Who deserves, who needs legal protection more?  An individual can&#39;t feasible sue a large corporation for copying their work; a large corporation can easily stifle individual voices, by hook or by crook.  If AI is allowed to hold copyright, this empowers monopolistic corporations, impoverishes individuals, and, if I can be poetic for a moment&mdash;and I CAN, since I&#39;m a human, not an AI&mdash;hastens the fall of Rome.
