It simply makes the most sense for AI works to be uncopyrightable. While the content (image or otherwise) generated by the novel software which exists today is not a collage, nor does it directly replicate content already existing (without specific instruction or other malicious use case, wherein it is more akin to describing the Mona Lisa to a painter so they may replicate it from your instructions alone), the content generated is not of human make and should not be copyrightable, and should instead automatically be public domain.
