I fully believe that AI as it is in its current state, is a poor replacement for human ingenuity and creativity. AI should be a tool that helps people with menial tasks that can be automated, and not a tool that cuts out humans completely from creative works to cut costs. Much of AI has been trained off stolen works as well, with the people it trained off not getting credit at all. AI can be a good tool, but regulations have to be put in place so that the people behind it are still credited and compensated for their work.
