It insane that this question has to be asked. AI should not be allowed to do anything a creative or academic or professional that a human being does for a living. This is not some reactionary Luddite manifesto, it is an account of results I have personally witnessed where AI was employed and, without fail, utterly bungled the job. You cannot expect better of it in complex issues such as copyright.<br/> <br/>At the most basic level, AI needs to be corralled because AI invariably messes up when doing humans&#39; jobs. I have attached a picture of a friend&#39;s cat run through a drawing AI program designed to filter photos in an anime style. I have also included an AI drawing of that friend run through the app&#39;s Naruto filter. Some photos turn out okay. But the existence of these (and they are only the most egregious examples) shows that artificial &quot;creativity&quot; is no match for the real thing. And no, more sophisticated AI will not prevent this. <br/><br/>This is from one of the more sophisticated programs of its kind, and instead of an error message or a blurred image, it does THIS. In academics, complex pattern detection in AI just leads to complex--but no less catastrophic--errors, such as an entire class&#39;s papers being falsely ruled plagiarized and the entire class being failed, as happened in a case earlier this year that garnered national attention. I worked briefly in transcription, and the company&#39;s entire pitch revolves around using humans instead of AI, to the extent that you do not get paid for any job you are found to be using AI for, but INVARIABLY someone would hook up their AI to an audio file hoping to get the pay without the work. Invariably, they assumed that if they loaded enough words into the AI, it would come out flawlessly and they could escape detection... and invariably, those AI transcriptions would end up in MY queue for corrections and they would not get paid, because it was OBVIOUS they used an AI. How, you ask? If the speaker went too quickly for it to follow, or had an accent, or stuttered, the AI couldn&#39;t go back and replay the file to get it right, so it just *guessed,* and its guesses were so random and unrelated to anything in the sentence, let alone the file, that it overall made less sense than a human who can&#39;t spell and was only half listening could have come up with, because a human 1. can rewind the file and listen again 2. even when guessing, makes guesses based on context clues rather than sound relative to a pre-programmed vocabulary. If a more complex AI in a photo filter does nothing but produce more complex mistakes in artistic settings, does irreparable damage to careers in academic settings, and spits out nonsense in professional transcription, there is absolutely no point in replacing a living human feeding by their families doing it the right way. <br/><br/>(If your knee jerk response is &quot;Well of course a human should check and correct its work,&quot; consider the following: if the human must do the same work, thus taking around the same time to complete it in order to fix the AI&#39;s inevitable glaring mistakes, because checking work requires work... what does involving an AI do other than ultimately add time and aggravation to the process? Why not just use the human and get it right--and faster--the first time?)<br/><br/>The US already runs on an almost entirely service economy because tech and manufacturing jobs are all outsourced to South and Central Asia. Outsourcing to inept machines just adds insult to injury. If you think it will stop at cutting into the &quot;little people&#39;s&quot; jobs, ask yourself: has the tech industry ever NOT expanded as far and wide as possible? Imagine if somebody had the (not) bright idea to let AI write legislative bills or generate summaries for legislators because bills are too tedious to read through. Would you trust an AI with that? Would you trust AI to take over any essential government function that involves reading or writing? Would you trust AI to design your home? If not, better think twice before replacing other important writing, reading, and creative human jobs with it. This includes matters of copyright, since, as I have shown, AI is no match for humans in any serious matter of industry performance.<br/><br/>On a note pertaining only to this survey, the instructions stipulate that an individual must supply identifying information for verification purposes (that you are concerned about AI replies to an inquiry about the wisdom of letting AI run rampant is both extremely concerning and extremely funny)... and then at the bottom of the screen it instructs you not to. I hold the error there to be self-evident. You get my name as required, and email for tracking purposes. The rest you&#39;ll have to get yourselves, as humans. Because you know you can&#39;t trust AI to know the difference.
