Please stop AI from taking our creative jobs. Artists, citizens, all of us deserve work. Until you institute a universal basic income, people should have their income protected. Also, I am concerned about racial and gender inequity. As someone trained in data, we have historically bad data (bad data in bad data out). I am mixed race and bad data cannot recognize my face half the time. Additionally, stop the use of AI to promote right with terrorism and fascism. AI is a tool. But like any other tool it needs regulation.
