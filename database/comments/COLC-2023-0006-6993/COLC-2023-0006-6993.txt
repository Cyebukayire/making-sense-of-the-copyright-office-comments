It&#39;s going to be difficult for the U.S. Copyright Office to determine whether an item submitted is copyrightable or not. With the inaccuracy of AI detectors, how is the copyright office going to accurately and fairly issue and reject copyrights? In this article from Stanford University, the inaccuracy of AI detection tools is discussed: https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-detectors-biased-against-non-native-english-writers<br/><br/>There is no discernible way to distinguish AI from human written material unless the author acknowledges they wrote their piece using AI. Even then, what percentage of the material is AI? How much guidance from the author did the AI have? Did the author weave in their own voice and edits? <br/><br/>There is a big misconception that AI yanks copyrighted styles, sentences, ideas, paragraphs, etc and regurgitates them. First off, ideas and styles can&#39;t be copyrighted. If they could, no one would ever get a copyright because everyone gets ideas from the things they read, watch, and experience. Secondly, there is no evidence that AI produces stolen materials unless a human user prompts it in a way that it does. It is a language learning model, which means it learns from materials like we do and bases its outputs on predictable patterns based on what the user put into a prompt. Rejecting AI produced materials based on the fact it is a language learning model that read millions of documents in books sets the precedence that anyone who has read anything and then written something can have their copyright rejected just based on the fact that they had input from the same exact things. For example, if someone writes a middle grade magic academy epic tale with witches and wizards and that author read Harry Potter, is their book no longer eligible for copyright?<br/>I think the overarching question regarding all of this is how will the U.S. Copyright Office determine 1. if AI was used, 2. how much AI is ok to use, 3. how does that usage compare to how much a person not using AI draws from copyrighted materials they&#39;ve read.<br/><br/>With imagery, it is much more straight forward given that a 1 sentence prompt is used to produce an image. Depending on the prompt, the image may or may not be eligible for copyright, but also, a lot of the AI image generators are in public spaces where anyone can take someone&#39;s image and submit it. Also, with a single sentence being adequate to generate an image, the liklihood of 2 different people&#39;s images turning out similar is higher than a book which is thousands and thousands of words with lots of prompts and human interaction going into the product. <br/><br/>
