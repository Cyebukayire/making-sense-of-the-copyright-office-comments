I am not a copyright owner. I write derivative fiction that is hosted on free websites. I make no money doing this. I do this out of enjoyment and love. Every word of my writing comes from my own brain unless otherwise stated. My writing was used, without my permission, to train AI writing like OpenAI and ChatGPT. My permission was not sought, nor was the permission of anyone else who writes and shares that writing as a hobby. The company formerly known as Twitter is now saying that anything posted on their site can be used to train AI. Art, writing, anything. To be considered art, to be copyrighted and protected, I believe would require that the &ldquo;artist&rdquo; or &ldquo;writer&rdquo; was using only their own creativity. If AI must be used, then the existing models that are little more than data-scraping thieves who have used copyrighted materials to train their models must be completely abolished and new, ethically trained models created. The AI that currently exists could not do so without having stolen copyrighted material and other private works of fiction and visual art. To use that AI and claim you now own a fictional world it developed from stolen material is wrong. The US Copyright Office should consider the training methods of these current AI when considering how to protect the existing copyrights. I cannot copyright my writing because it is derivative of an existing copyright. I posit that AI trained by stealing copyright materials falls under that same category. It is derivative work, not original, and therefore, not protected by copyright.
