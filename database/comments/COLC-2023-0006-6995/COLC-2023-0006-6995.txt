My thoughts on the matter of AI and copyrighting are as follows. Not only does the current state of these kinds of generators found themselves on theft and legally grey practices, but it does not allow for any kind of transparency when it involves previously copyrighted material or what content is being sourced in the created of AI generated images.<br/><br/>The inception of these kinds of AI generators therein lies the problem. Without material for AI to train themselves on, they cannot reproduce content. AI is reliant on this material in order to function. It cannot exist alone without it. The artists that these generators are referencing, are training on, are involved in the process, and to exclude them from their ability to opt in, allowing this software to take without permission, use without consent or acknowledgement, is akin to using blueprints for buildings, or fabric and patterns from seamstresses, without compensation. <br/><br/>Beyond the creation and training of these machines, their current use ignores the present day legal standing of intellectual property, allowing both the users of these generators as well as the source material to be in legal danger without either of them knowing. Copyrightable material can be sourced in AI engines without full disclosure to the users of AI, which could end up in a host of legal issues. Since many of these AI generators simply scrape the internet for images in order to train their systems, it ignores the legal obligations that protect companies&#39; interests and intellectual property, and buries them in obscurity with the lack of transparency on what has been used when generating outputs. Not only does this come into play when discussing logos or images owned and copyrighted, but also images that may break other laws, including images considered not safe for work, images involving minors, and images of those that have passed.<br/><br/>The final point I have is on the intent of AI generated material. In many of these generators, a user is given the ability to prompt AI generators with artist&#39;s names, which only furthers the legal clarity involved with the entire system. Being able to profit off of the use of a specific artist&#39;s namesake while the artist in question receives no compensation, gives no consent, and is allowed not even notice of use of their art, their styles, the source what they make their living off of, is insidious and is a disservice to all masters of their own trade.<br/><br/>I believe that Artificial Intelligence has a place in the world, and like many technologies, the creation of them precedes the legal and ethical practices that should be established in order for them to exist cohesively in society. Without strict copyrighting and consent involved in these spaces, we not only create legal obstacles for our future selves, but deprive us of the works of thousands of artisans by allowing their work to be stolen without any kind of legal recourse.
