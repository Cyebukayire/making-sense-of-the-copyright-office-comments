Anything generated by &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; must be labeled as such. Training such programs must be done only with explicit, written permission from the human creators in question. No scraping of existing databases, and no one had better even think about touching Archive of Our Own/Organization for Transformative Works. There MIGHT be an actual use for these generative programs, but they cannot be used to replace human labor, creative works in particular. Programs like ChatGPT only recycle what they have been exposed to; they do not and cannot create anything new or innovative. Nothing they generate should be copyrightable. In short, I believe &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; should be strongly regulated, and used minimally, if it must be used at all.
