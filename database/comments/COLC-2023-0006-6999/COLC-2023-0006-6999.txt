I am commenting as an artist, not from the U.S., but i believe i still should as us legislation affects the rest of the world.<br/>Ai models built on the work of millions of artists without their consent to replace them is not okay. Such an move will reduce jobs circulating in the market by millions, leaving many jobless, which i believe most countries are not in a place to address with welfare programs and such. Media also is important in influencing our peers and the next generation by teaching points of views of other characters and such, a lack of morality in our programming replaced by hollow artificial intelligence material created from putting together existing media will not provide further insight into our human condition, nor make us kinder as people.
