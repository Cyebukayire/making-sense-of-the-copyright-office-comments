Regulation is definitely needed to ensure fairness, accuracy, and transparency. As a published author, I do not want to have works attributed to me that are not actually mine. Nor do I want my published works misused, misquoted, or plagiarized. As a university professor, I want full disclosure of AI use in my classroom. Ownership of AI-created material must be clearly defined.
