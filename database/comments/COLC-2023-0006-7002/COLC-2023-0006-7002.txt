Creative works that incorporate other works are regarded as derivative, and as such require license from the original creator. AI technologies bypass this process in an automated manner, by &quot;scraping&quot; the internet to deliver content relevant to a query. Scraping in this sense means copying and concatenating existing works - where, if a human mind were involved, would constitute willful plagiary. This effects blatant infringement of the rights of the creators of those works.
