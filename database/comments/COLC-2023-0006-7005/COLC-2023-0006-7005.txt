A.I. has been trained on existing art without providing notification to, or getting permission from, the creators of the existing art. A piece of A.I. generated &quot;artwork&quot; is nothing more than a digital mash-up of many different pieces of pre-existing, copywritten, artworks. As an example, if A.I. &quot;artwork&quot; is allowed to be copywritten then a company can have an employee type the prompt &quot;in the style of Norman Rockwell&quot; into a program and now claim that the generated artwork solely belongs to the corporation, without giving any ownership or acknowledgment to the Rockwell family. A.I. in the arts already harms writers, actors, musicians and illustrators. If A.I. &quot;artwork&quot; is allowed to be created by someone who has never studied, worked, or practiced in the chosen art field, it is a slap in the face to artists and shows that art is not valued, nor are artists. If corporations are allowed to copyright A.I. images they will use it to replace working artists and that will prove that the only thing that matters is capitalism and the bottom line, and not ethics or responsibility. A.I. does not create anything of it&#39;s own, it only samples and steals and the original creators receive nothing for their contributions.
