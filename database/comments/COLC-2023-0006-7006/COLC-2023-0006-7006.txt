As a writer and creator, I am deeply upset by the reality that AI models are being trained without my permission on my and fellow writers work, with the express purpose of supplanting our creative output with machine generated texts explicitly meant to mimic our style and tone. It has made me reluctant to share my work, and frustrated that a business model explicitly intended to make writing unprofitable for future writers is being stood up by stealing the hard work writers creating and repackaging it. <br/><br/>AI models are not creating, they are stealing the creative tricks of others, and in the process exerting a severe dampening effect on artistic production across fields. What the AI models are doing would be called plagiarism if any human did it, we should not suddenly deem it acceptable because a human coded the actions taking place rather than held the own themselves.
