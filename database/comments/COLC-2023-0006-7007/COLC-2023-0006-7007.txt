I worry that if AI material is able to be copyrighted, corporations seeking to cut costs will use it as a way to not pay artists, and we will all be poorer for it. AI is misleadingly named; there is no intelligence behind it. It cannot function without plagiarism-- no current AI technology has been made without stolen material. And it has already begun to make search engines like google unusable-- many of the most algorithmically popular results are either wholly factually incorrect or simply AI written articles that contain nothing useful. Right now there is no ethical AI and the vast majority of uses for it are exploitative. It must be regulated.
