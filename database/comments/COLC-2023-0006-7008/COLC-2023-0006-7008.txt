Machine learning systems are not individuals, and they should not be afforded the rights of individuals such as copyright. They are incapable of original thought, so the resulting content will be purely based on the training data they take in. If possible, the copyright of the creators of the works being used as training data should be protected, and either way the resulting content should automatically be in the public domain. <br/><br/>If the owner of a machine learning system wanted to claim a copyright on a work generated via machine learning system, the owner of said system should be able to prove that they own the copyright to all training data used by the machine learning system.
