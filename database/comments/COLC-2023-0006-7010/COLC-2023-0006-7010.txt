I am a professional writer. AI is threatening our livelihood. <br/><br/>Art comes from the human mind. the reason we connect with it is because there is energy behind it that we can empathize with. Chat GPT and other AI is threatening to undermine that and make one of the most basic human experiences defunct. <br/><br/>It goes without saying that other artists learn from consuming the work of other artists. But in our capitalist system, that means we are participating in uplifting other artists with our dollar. AI is essentially stealing in order to create soulless art.
