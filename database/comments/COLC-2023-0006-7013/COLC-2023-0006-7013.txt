The constitution says copyright law is supposed to promote the progress of science and the arts &ldquo;by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo; AI does not write. The software engineers who developed AI deliberately violated copyright law in developing this technology. There is no gray area in this statement.  There is absolutely no way to ethically regulate or guarantee enough &quot;human hand&quot; involvement in any AI text to justify copyright protection. People who create AI for profit are literally using the works of authors for profit. Where is the exclusive right granted by copyright protection for these authors who write, as stated in the constitution, when this happens? AI is already having a chilling effect on human-only art production, the opposite of the spirit of the copyright law. I feel strongly that such material should not be eligible for copyright protection.
