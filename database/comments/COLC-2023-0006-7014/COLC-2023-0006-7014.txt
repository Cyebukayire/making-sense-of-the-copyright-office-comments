This technology was created using copyrighted work without permission and the developers knew it. They knew this was illegal. They now want to profit from the poison tree which is barred by the US court system. There is no way to ethically regulate or guarantee enough human involvement in any AI text to justify copyright protection. Human authors/creators deserve the protection the copyright office is supposed to provide them. Allowing AI generated works the same copyright protection would turn that protection into a farce.
