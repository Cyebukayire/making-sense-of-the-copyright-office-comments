I am a former author and AI is decimating the creative world. There are garbage books being generated with AI that are topping the Amazon sales charts because of bots pushing them up. Covers are being created using AI that is stealing the work of human artists and driving human creators out of business. It is removing so much creativity and hurting so many artists and creators and it needs to be regulated or stopped completely.
