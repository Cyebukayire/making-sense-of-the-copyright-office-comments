Hi there, I work in the film industry, in the Costume Department. I&rsquo;ve been out of work all year because of the industry battles in regard to AI.<br/><br/>AI poses an existential threat to my industry and career. The copyright conversation controls how film industry CEOs will choose to exploit AI in the future.  Much of the conversation from a labor perspective revolves around scraped materials being stolen from outside, usually unknowing, sources. That&rsquo;s a relatively straightforward conversation to have in regard to copyright. But what happens when a major film studio owns rights to vast libraries of media? More than enough to feed a proprietary system. As it stands, studios, could use AI, a proprietary library and a single editor to compose a film with known celebrities, that could be copyrightable replacing an ENTIRE industry. Maintaining the human component to art (a thing endemic to what MAKES us) is of far greater weight than the basic consideration of legal source material ownership.<br/><br/>Please look at this in the context of artists vs corporations, and please remember, that there is no art for a corporation to exploit without the artist being able to exist in the first place. Please protect artists, and in-turn our own humanity. <br/><br/>Thanks for your time.
