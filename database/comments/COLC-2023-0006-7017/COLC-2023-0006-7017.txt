&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; - generative computer output for text, audio, and images - has had an extremely detrimental effect on the artists whose works were used to train the programs as people have instead turned to using cheap generated products instead of hiring the artists the programs emulate. However, since AI programs aren&#39;t going to vanish, there are several things that could turn them into a much more beneficial and even symbiotic tools for creators of every type.<br/><br/>Firstly, no computer generated image should be copyrightable. No AI work is independent of the corpus the program was trained upon; therefore it cannot be held as an independent creation by the program. Secondly, the works are statistical pastiches of the works fed into the training corpus. The program will take the prompts and produce what is statistically most likely to be the combination of words, sounds, lines, colors, etc. to replicate what it was trained on. It therefore cannot be said to meet the modicum of creativity required to make a work copyrightable.<br/><br/>Secondly, there needs to be much, much greater transparency in the algorithms used to train generative programs. This is especially true since existing programs have been trained on masses of stolen art and data; creators whose works have been scraped for training should be able to easily see which programs used their work. Similarly, people using the generative programs should be able to check and see what sources were used to train the program.<br/><br/>Thirdly, following on from the stolen work of creators in current generative programs, all creators whose work has been used to train programs without their consent should be entitled to financial compensation from the program creators AND have the right and ability to have their work removed from the program immediately and upon request.<br/><br/>Fourthly, all work should be considered expressly opt-in rather than opt-out. People who want to use specific works to train programs should have to ask the creators individually if the works can be used; platform-wide approvals of the sort that X/twitter and deviantart have attempted to roll out are vastly over reaching and should not be allowed. Consent should be expressly given, ongoing, and revocable on the part of the creators whose works are used by programmers for generative AI. <br/><br/>As a corollary to the previous point, creators deserve to be paid for their work and should be paid for both the use of the work in the training corpus generally and again at a smaller fee similar to residuals when their work is used to prompt the program. <br/> <br/>In short, no copyrightable works should be used to train AI programs without the express permission of and payment made to the copyright holder. It is unacceptable to allow programs to use stolen work which is the result of countless hours and even years of learning, skill, labor, and experimentation by the creators is a violation of their rights as creators. This holds true regardless of whether the program is free to use or paid for by prompters. To borrow a phrase from the Copyright Office and film industry: you wouldn&#39;t download a car because piracy is a crime. Whether the work is stolen by individuals or by companies creating generative programs, stealing work is illegal.
