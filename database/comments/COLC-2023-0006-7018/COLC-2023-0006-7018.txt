As an editor, avid reader, and blogger for many years, the uptick in generative AI is disappointing. Theft of art in any form is wrong. As a parent, the easy ability for my children&rsquo;s photos on social media to be stolen and manipulated for unlawful and immoral purposes terrifies me. As a consumer, seeing businesses layoff human workers to employ AI resources to and line their greedy pockets makes me angry. Generative AI needs laws and regulations not currently in place, before things get worse than they already are.
