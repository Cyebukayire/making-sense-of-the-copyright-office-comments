AI created works should not be copyrighted. This will help save people&rsquo;s&rsquo; jobs, preventing studios from replacing voice actors, writers, and artists. This also protects every citizen who creates. AI often steals from the work of others, unintentionally or not. It is best that AI is heavily regulated and unable to be used in any professional scene period. It is the safest for everyone and the best outcome for the economy and future.
