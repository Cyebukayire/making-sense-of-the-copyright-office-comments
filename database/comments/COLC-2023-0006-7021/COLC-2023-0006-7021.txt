Gen AI in its current state is unethical,immoral, dangerous, dehumanising and potentially illegal. Allowing generative AI to continue existing in its current form would be to reward large tech companies with the payment free access to millions of works created by talented individuals, who have worked for years to achieve a certain level of skill. Gen AI does not bolster creativity, it stifles it. It devalues while industries, thus removing billions from the world economy. Any profits to come from this tech would go to the tech companies and not the Millions of people whose work this tech is trained on with absolutely no remuneration. Dangerous, immoral, regressive...cataclysmic.
