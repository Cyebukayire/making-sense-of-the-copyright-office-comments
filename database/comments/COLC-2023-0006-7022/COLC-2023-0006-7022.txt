Use of copyrighted works or other intellectual property to &#39;teach/train&#39; AI should prevent any person or entity from using any resulting works/outputs with the exception of the person who holds the original copyright or intellectual property for any and all items used to &#39;teach/train&#39; the AI. <br/><br/>Anything AI created should be excluded from ability to be copyrighted or held as intellectual property. Copyright and intellectual property laws were created to protect original thoughts/ideas/innovations/ect. AI is not at this point capable of original thought and therefore cannot produce anything truly original only derivative. <br/><br/>Any AI created output/art/material/ect should need to be clearly marked as such as well as having requirements for what an AI can use to learn (to ensure not only accuracy but to minimize copyright infringement and harmful beliefs that are built into some areas of everyday life). Requirements for AI certification for use will probably be needed so that the content used to &#39;teach/train&#39; the AI can be verified as material that meets the criteria for use. (EI: Material must be factually actuate. Material must not be copyrighted or the intellectual property of another. Material cannot promote bigotry. ect) At this point in time AI is not able to distinguish fact from fiction or identify information, once AI is more advanced the criteria will likely need to be split by the type/capabilities of AI in question.)<br/><br/>The use of AI in the arts and entertainment industries is particularly concerning. It is removing jobs, encouraging exploitation, hurting the economy (particularly commission/gig), and ultimately undermines artwork (and its value) as a whole. Art and entertainment are the backbone of not only huge sections of the economy but the backbone of our culture and country. The use of AI in these areas in particular is deeply concerning as it removes the human element from the most human of our experiences. <br/><br/>AI requires not only legislation but it requires legislation with forethought. AI will continue to grow and expand its capabilities so its important that the laws created take that into consideration as AI will undoubtedly outpace the legislative process as most technology has.
