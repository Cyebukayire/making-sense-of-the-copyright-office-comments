Ai generated material is not art. It&#39;s not creative. It&#39;s a mish-mash of stolen material scrapped from the collective works of human creativity and put back together in a pretty form. The people who created these Ai generators, all of them, were fully aware that they were taking from owned properties without permission. <br/><br/>They could easily have stuck with works that were no longer copyright protected, or free to public domain but they knew they wouldn&#39;t make as much money that way. It&#39;s the ability to steal celebrities&#39; appearances and take from the styles of real artists that makes AI as lucrative as it is. They knew that, so they deliberately scrapped owned properties to use in their generators.<br/>Stealing should not be rewarded. Neither Ai art nor writing should ever be allowed a copyright. <br/><br/>Furthermore, pictures and writing should be required to state that they are AI generated any time they are published or posted publicly so that people are aware that what they are seeing is not real. I&#39;ve already seen this technology used to trick and fool people, and scam them out of money. I&#39;ve seen celebrity pictures that are faked, placing real people in compromising positions and people believe it. It&#39;s become clear that most people can&#39;t tell the difference between a real photo and an Ai generated picture and this is going to be a major problem if laws are not put into place.
