I will hold my comments pertaining to text AI-generated content as I am not familiar enough with image AIs. <br/><br/>A lot of effort is needed to generate any creative AI output. As an experimenter with text AIs, I&#39;ve put as much effort into getting an output for a short story as I would have writing it myself. My prompts were upwards of 2000 words containing every basic creative element that I would have written out in crafting the story myself. I had to massage the output by guiding the AI to produce it in the way I wanted that pleased both me and my readers. <br/><br/>My end product was approximately 60% AI-generated text with a lot of my own words interspaced. If I were to apply for a copyright according to the March  Guidelines, I would be facing an onerous process to identify all the AI passages that my manuscript contained. Tracking changes as I edited would also have an undue burden on me to track AI versus human-generated text within my manuscript.<br/><br/>Text AIs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) are trained the same way humans are trained and do not retain a live database. Thus, their output has the same chance of violating copyright as a human. <br/><br/>I would recommend that for AI-generated works, all prompts must be included in the application, possibly broken down into chapters/sections since that is what is required with current technology to produce a reasonable output. Advanced AI authors use a very sophisticated prompt called a &quot;super-prompt&quot;. As I had described previously, this includes all aspects of creative work that any author generally does to prepare to write their manuscript. As the work progresses, additional larger prompts are necessary to guide the AI and prevent it from drifting away.
