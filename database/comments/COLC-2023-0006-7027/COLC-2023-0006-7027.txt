The current models for Machine Learning are all built off of copyrighted works without permission and are frequently being used to mimic those works on which it is built using artist and authors names and styles as prompts. Simply put, the models that exist are built off of stolen works and are charging money to access the models - paying nothing to those it takes from and having no concern for the copyright holder&#39;s consent but happy to make a profit off those stolen works.<br/><br/>Models should require transparency on what they are trained on and require explicit voluntary consent of any works not in the public domain where copyright is not applicable.
