Allowing AI work to be copyrighted will deprive hundreds of thousands of creators of income. It is difficult enough to make an income as a writer, artist, actor, or photographer; allowing AI the privilege of copyright will make that even more difficult.

I implore you to keep the impact of art on the human spirit in mind.
