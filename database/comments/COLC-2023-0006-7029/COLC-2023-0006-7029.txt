Name: James Cameron Coe<br/><br/>Hello.<br/>My name is Cam. I&rsquo;m 24 years old. I&rsquo;m currently studying to be an airline pilot. I make music and I do ink and graphite drawings. I love to write poetry and occasionally on a wild hair, I write essays. I do commissions when the clients wants align with my ability. <br/><br/>Every aspect of my life the way it exists is under threat by unregulated artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>Currently, I&rsquo;m having to hedge my bets that my career as a pilot will not be obsolesced by self landing aircraft. Not just that I may be relegated to monitoring, but that I may be removed entirely from my role. This may be some time off, but it is very concerning to me as stories of Tesla Autopilot crashes make their way across my desk at the same time. <br/><br/>I think AI of this type needs much more time to develop before it&rsquo;s ready for use in the transportation sector. I think the law needs to reflect this. A certain boundary needs to be crossed with provable robustness in the face of edge-case readiness and the inclusion of failsafes and redundancy before AI is fully controlling vehicles like cars, buses, and airplanes. When this kind of AI is finally allowed to continue, guaranteed monitoring roles should be opened inside the vehicle to ensure a human is always present and alert to take the wheel or yoke when something inevitably goes wrong. There are, of course, natural phenomena like solar wind that can damage computers. This would doom hundreds or thousands of airplanes to fall from the sky in the absence of a human monitor trained to land a powerless aircraft. <br/><br/>Many of my fellow artists and writers are already losing their jobs and previous clients to unregulated artificial intelligence. Why pay a skilled portrait artist when you can just upload a picture and a computer will steal their style for you? Why actually write your midterm paper when ChatGPT can produce brilliant prose in a customized voice for free?<br/><br/>None of this work is being materialized out of nothing. Much like filter-feeding, it&rsquo;s a black box that takes in large masses of data, reconfigures it to match an input query, and pushes out an amalgamation of already published work that fits the original prompt. <br/><br/>It&rsquo;s plagiarism of a thousand cuts. <br/><br/>At the very least, it&rsquo;s dishonest. <br/><br/>For this kind of artificial intelligence, I suggest that companies be required to publish the scope of their data sets. You should be able to easily search this set for your work, and if your work is included without your consent, you should be able to easily and quickly have it removed. Works produced by the AI should be marked in a certain manner, labeling them permanently and verifiably as that of artificial intelligence. Perhaps in a similar way to check digits in VIN numbers. <br/><br/> AI is currently being used to spread mass disinformation online. There needs to be a much larger effort to find the sources of these ploys and put an end to them. Fear-mongering, virtue-signaling, and other tactics for playing with the thoughts of our nations most vulnerable (youth and elderly) are being used across the internet. This content is easy to spot. Often an unnatural sounding voice over a random video that does not fit the narrative. They&rsquo;ll tell a story that&rsquo;s meant to get the viewer to feel a certain way, often about a company or a politician, or even a country and her people. This kind of content needs to be banned outright, and a section of investigators needs to be put to task destroying it wherever it is being produced. It is a massive developmental risk.<br/><br/>Facial recognition is perhaps the worst offender on the list. Companies like Clearview AI, rapidly scraping facial recognition data off the internet without consent, will simply be the end of privacy. I know that this gives law enforcement and the government as a whole the upper hand. It allows counter-protest action to be carried out much more easily. This cannot be allowed to stand. Soon, one may be able to determine any stranger&rsquo;s identity from a quick picture. Stalkers will find their prey. Advertisers will follow target individuals in every walk of their life with harassing, and increasingly personal ads. Companies may begin to use this data in bad faith. There is simply no way to adequately predict the harm that may be caused by unregulated facial recognition. This chapter of artificial intelligence needs to have its wings clipped entirely. Identities should not be attached to faces in a global database unless there&rsquo;s a solid reason to do so (criminals, predators, recognition of foreign intelligence, fraud). The average citizen should not have to worry about the consequences of a simple security camera.<br/><br/>You have a massive opportunity to do a lot of good in this field. You also have a massive opportunity to allow a lot of damage. For the sake of my generation and our future, please do your best to protect the rights of the people.
