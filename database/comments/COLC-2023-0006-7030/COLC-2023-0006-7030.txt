I am a traditionally published author, and US copyright law is the only thing protecting my work from being mined by AI and completely overtaken. My intellectual property is entirely my own, and no author or artist deserves to have artificial intelligence trained on their hard work. As creatives, we are much more than artificial, and we deserve protection from our work&#39;s misuse.
