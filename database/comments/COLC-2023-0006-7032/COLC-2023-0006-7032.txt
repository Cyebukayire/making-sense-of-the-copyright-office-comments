I want use of AI in content creation strongly monitored, marked in a transparent and obvious way and with sources for the training material. Artists/authors/creators of said material should be asked for permission out of respect for their craft and the time it took them to accumulate the skill and finish the piece. For someone else to just scrape off of that is unfair. Furthermore, in giving permission artists should be owned fair compensation, as for any other type of labor. Also from the consumer perspective, I want to know when something is AI generated so I can be aware of there being a conscious thought and intent behind something vs. an intransparent algorithm being the driving force of a piece. In order to assess an AI generated piece of content I also want insight on the algorithm that was used to create it, so I can evaluate whether certain biases or otherwise problematic or manipulative practices or unintentional coincidences are in place.
