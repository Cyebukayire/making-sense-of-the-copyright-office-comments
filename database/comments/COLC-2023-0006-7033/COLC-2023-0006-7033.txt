AI generated art is equivalent to intellectual property theft. If a master forger copies a work of art and tries to sell it for profit, it&rsquo;s considered theft. AI is a master forger. Taking bits and pieces of images and reconfiguring them in a way that the original works are still recognizable is theft unless consent for use has been explicitly given and/or credit to the original has also been given. Theft should never be allowed so flagrantly, even lauded as it seems to be with AI.
