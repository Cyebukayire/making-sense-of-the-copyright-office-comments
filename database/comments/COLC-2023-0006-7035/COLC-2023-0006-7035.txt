My first novel is among the 191,000 books stolen by the proprietors of Books3 to train their AI. I was never contacted by these companies or asked permission for use, which is clearly for commercial purposes and meant to generate profits for these large companies. When are we going to set limits on the volume and type of data that tech giants are allowed to steal for their own profit? Copyright protection should protect writers from their infringement in cases of stripping by AI.
