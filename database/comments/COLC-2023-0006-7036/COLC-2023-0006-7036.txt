Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment.<br/>I&#39;m am a artist and graphic designer, who worked as an illustrator and a video game artist. I order to find work, both as a freelancer and as an hired artist, I need to have my artwork on a public website, showing my skills to potential employers. Said website has been used by AI robot to farm my works, both personal and under commercial copyright, without my consent.<br/>There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.  While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.  To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.
