AI. The damage has already been done. Technology has opened Pandora&#39;s box. Artists, musicians, writers -- creators livelihoods are in jeopardy. AI generated art created autonomously and/or with human input should not be copyrighted. I am in favor for more regulation to prohibit AI search systems.
