The current policy embodied in the March office guidance and recent decisions such as the Review Board Decision on Theatre d&#39;Opera Spatial is proper and should continue. Allowing copyright to issue for purely or even substantially AI-created works would cause innumerable headaches for the Copyright Office, be out of step with the plain language of the copyright act, and create disincentives for actual human authorship--it would be akin to allowing a sculptor to copyright an untouched block of clay he ordered off Amazon.
