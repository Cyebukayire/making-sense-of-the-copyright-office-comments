Please consider taking the strictest possible measures to curtail the use of AI and large language models in creative industries to protect the rights and jobs of those of us who work in creative careers. No work that uses services like ChatGPT or Midjourney in any form should be copyrightable, and any service that draws on the work of others MUST expose its entire data set and MUST have explicit written permission from the owner of each copyright, authorizing the use of a given work in a data set. This permission should also be transparently published alongside the source list. There should be severe sanctions for any AI-focused product that does not participate in full transparency with regards to sources/use explicit &quot;opt-in&quot; permissions from copyright holders. All pre-existing data sets, which include countless amounts of material where copyright was not explicitly granted, must be purged and rendered unlawful for use. Company products that are found to still use these pre-existing data sets should be subject to physical and legal sanctions. Thank you.
