I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in this topic and its request for public feedback. I am both an author/artist and supporter of the arts- my works pays for a small portion of my life but it is also the livelihood in which others live, it stimulates creativity in our world. <br/><br/>Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution. The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.  This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.  Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright. If we, as people are limited to what we can create based on copyright or paying artists for their work to use, then generative AI must also be obliged under the same terms of agreement. <br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>Thanks for opening this up to public; we all hope that you will choose fairly the best course of actions for all artists, including those who make generative AI art.
