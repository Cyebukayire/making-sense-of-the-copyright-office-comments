Generative AI does not fundamentally change anything about copyright compared to historical precedents, it only speeds up the creation of new works, but does not substantially change the kinds of works that can be created compared to the past.<br/><br/>Rather than being a threat to artists, generative AI systems are the great equalizer, raising the skill floor for all and opening access to aspiring artists who are still developing their craft just as much as for seasoned professionals. There is no substitute for taste, and skilled artists will remain very much in demand for their ability to bring polish and consistency of art direction to creative works long into the future.<br/><br/>Similar to PhotoShop, generative AI systems speed up the process of experimentation and prototyping as artists explore the creative space of their designs, and should also help improve communications of artistic direction between clients and creators, allowing a &quot;show, don&#39;t tell&quot; approach which could greatly improve the quality of communications during projects.<br/><br/>In terms of training AI models, we should apply the same standards of plagiarism to machine outputs that we do to humans. It should not be a crime to learn or be inspired, and every person learns by including both observations and examples into their memories for later use, particularly among artists. Similarly, it should not be a crime for machines to learn about or remember details about the world by viewing it, especially since they are going to need to be able to recognize objects, symbols, logos, people, situations, events, and many other occurrences if they are to assist humanity in our daily lives.<br/><br/>It is not that different for a person to take a screenshot of a web site or a picture with their smart phone in order to remember the details of something they are viewing, and these are perfectly accepted and commonplace activities today. Additionally, we have almost 30 years of web crawling activities from search engines that have been essential to helping users find information and make use of the Internet, without which the Internet would have ended up as a fancy electronic phone book.<br/><br/>Internet search continues to create trillions of dollars of economic activity each year for the United States alone, and AI is positioned to create even more value than we can properly estimate over the next decades as the technology progresses. The worst thing we could do would be to prevent these machines from properly learning about our world or being able to create works that are of value to humans, please don&#39;t restrict the tools that will help our businesses and nation build the future.
