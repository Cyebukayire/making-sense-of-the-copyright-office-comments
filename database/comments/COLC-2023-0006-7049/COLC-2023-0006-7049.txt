I don&#39;t know a lot about any of this, but it seems to me that AI creations probably fall into the same category as fan fiction in that its fairuse unless you&#39;re making money off of it. As for companies who used copyrighted material to train AI systems and then charged people for the AI, that seems like its not fairuse. I definitely support required AI watermarks or labels for distinction between human and computer generated creations.
