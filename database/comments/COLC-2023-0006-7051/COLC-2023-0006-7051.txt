AI generated materials are a combination of multiple sources of input from many creative people behind the works they make. AI does not create works on its own, rather finds the patterns from these sources and best matches the suited prompt that is being sought out. If AI did not have this input, it would not be able to create the depths found in human made works. It can be used as a tool to create, it can be molded to fit what it&#39;s intended goal is, but is built off of many individual copyright holders<br/>Without regulation in AI, individual work will be used as a collective input without awareness or permission from individual holders, and may be registered as a copyright under someone else&#39;s work. <br/>Some websites that use AI include the admission in the terms of service that any submitted content is going to be used in training AI, including major sites that many individuals use to spread word about those same individually copyrighted works. <br/>Inevitably these patterns will be made into its own market value, and ultimately create a means for formulaic outputs that appeal to a userbase (algorithms already do this.) <br/>Without copyright regulation in these spaces, individual copyright will consistently be broken, and they may not be able to afford a legal suite against larger companies who use these tools and data to cut costs.
