I believe firmly that nothing generated more than a small percent (say, 10%) by AI should be copyrightable. I believe explicit permission should be needed from artists, writers, and creators to use their art to train AI. I think that any AI training done off of art (of any sort) without EXPLICIT permission should come with the same penalty as the theft of intellectual property. For example, an owner of AI who trained AI on an Amazon-published ebook has stolen the content of that book and should be considered as having damaged it hugely, since any sales of any writing done by that AI could be money from the pocket of the authors whose work was used. I believe AI should not do &ldquo;enjoyable&rdquo; work like create art but can be used by workers to ease the load of unpleasant work. I think perhaps the sale of work created more than a small amount by AI is plagiarism since it is selling reproduced art. I think companies and sellers should disclose any work done more than, say, 20% by AI.
