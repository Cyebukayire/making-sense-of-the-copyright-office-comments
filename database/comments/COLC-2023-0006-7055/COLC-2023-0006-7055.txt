AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; in every form, such as physical media, digital artwork, and writing, is trained off real artists and their hard work.  It can only replicate and steal.  AI is not sentient and has no creativity; It&rsquo;s just code.  AI works are, therefore, the property of every person whose work was gutted and repackaged by a machine.  To consider anything AI produces as valid creative material is to dismiss real creativity.
