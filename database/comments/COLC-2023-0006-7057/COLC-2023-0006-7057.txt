In the art and book world- artificial intelligence has been trained on stolen, copyrighted works. I have personally had my artwork stolen and put through an AI engine and I believe that it has directly impacted my livelihood. Images or narratives that are generated via AI should not have copyright protection as they are already violating the original artist or authors&rsquo; copyright. <br/>
