I have seen the ways that generated images has and artists and I believe that all AI software, image or other wise, should have to state what images they are using to train their ai and get the permission from the artists to train their ai based on the artists works. I also believe that the ai trainers should have an archive of every work they used to train the ai, along with credit to the person who made it, such as, where they got it from, when they got the work, the work, and who is the creator of the work. I believe that this will help to give credit to the artists for their work, though I do understand that an ai training based off of another ai&rsquo;s work will be difficult to manage in terms of credit.
