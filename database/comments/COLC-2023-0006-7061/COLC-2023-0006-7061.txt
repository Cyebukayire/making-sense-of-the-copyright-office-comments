Legislative or regulatory steps related to AI are absolutely warranted and necessary. We see almost daily that these artificial intelligence systems are using copyrighted material for training--material that is not being licensed, and not acknowledged as the underpinning of technology poised to make unimaginable amounts of money for tech companies. Moreover, these systems are designed to replace an individual human creator&#39;s work, thereby diminishing the market for creation and handing financial opportunity to people who have made limited effort, if any, to create new, saleable products. This shift of funding will limit the production of artistic work that is vital to humanity, and decimate, if not destroy, the industries that produce, disseminate, and support it. Finally, use of these systems essentially creates derivative works of copyrighted materials, which should be under the control of the original creator while in copyright, and those creations are not man made and should not be eligible for further copyright--or even for sale.
