Thank you for opening comments on this matter. I&rsquo;m currently at university studying to be a writer, and this affects me personally. People deserve to write and publish their writing without their work being stolen to train AI, and it encroaches on their copyright. AI shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to train on published works, or any works for that matter. If someone wants to train an ai on writing, the writing that the AI is fed should be produced solely for the purpose of it being fed to AI. Writers of all kinds, from traditionally published authors to fanfiction writers, shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about their ideas and hard work being stolen by machines.
