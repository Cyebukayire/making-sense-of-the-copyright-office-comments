I believe that AI works should not be copyrightable, as their very creation involves stealing the work of others.  That sort of theft of art, words, and intellectual property is amoral and no one should be able to profit off of these AI generated works.  People and companies should be able to pursue legal action against AI generators for copyright infringement and stealing their works.
