Thank you for taking the time to review public feedback on this matter. I&#39;m a librarian who regularly works with copyrighted materials and who cares deeply about the authors and artists whose work we hold in our collections. There is a strong history of policy protecting artists&#39; exclusive rights to their creative works during the copyright period, and without their consent, generative AI should not be trained on their property. Doing so would be a violation of the creator&#39;s exclusive rights to their work. The Copyright Office should adopt the position that training generative AI on works that are under copyright is an infringement of the Copyright Act. Thank you for your consideration.
