I think works produced by AI should be able to be copyrighted by the human who used this tool. This is like copyrights on photographs produced by a camera. There should be no or a simple standard on how much human effort constitutes a human work. Something like patents; ownership of the first article means ownership of its distribution.  <br/><br/>We already figured this out with cameras, etc. It is even more important now with generative AI. To reaffirm that we value human work as a new era of even more automated tools approaches. By continuing to value human effort, we value humans in an age where there are alternatives to humans. Valuing humans beyond the standard of utility. <br/><br/>I also think we should also value the human work that went into the training data, tuning and presentation. If an original work was used to train a system, then within a statute of limitations (mainly a time limit as with other IP), the human owner, having previously indicated they wanted to protect their work (like as with patents, trademarks and copyright), can dictate its distribution. This time limit is important since all artistry borrows from the transcendent which was freely given. But we must encourage the profession of the human artist if we want more art produced by humans.<br/><br/>This also has implications to a key problem with AI: alignment. I believe the best solution is to encourage distributed ownership of AI. &ldquo;If everyone is botting, no one is&rdquo;. If human interaction with AI tools produces valued articles, supporting the livelihood of many, then humans will want more to own these tools. Ownership out in the open vs in secret. For the same reason we support education of the masses. Diffuse ownership reduces the likelihood a tool (like having a brain) is exploited against the defenseless masses. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
