In my opinion, art and writing primarily created by artificial intelligence should not be material that can be copyrighted by humans or organizations. Generally speaking, whenever an AI produces a piece of art or media, it does so by &ldquo;learning&rdquo; from data given to in, in the form of art or writing fed to its algorithm. Oftentimes, the art or writing fed to these algorithms is stolen from the original creators, who do not approve of the usage of their work and will receive no credit.<br/><br/>If large entertainment companies get the chance to utilize AI in the production of their products, they will do so by feeding their AI arguably stolen content produced by genuinely hardworking artists and writers. They will use this stolen content to create revenue that will never be seen or touched by the original creators, and these large companies will be the only party that benefits from it.
