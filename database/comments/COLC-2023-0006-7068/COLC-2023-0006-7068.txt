It is my personal opinion that human prompting and editing of AI generated work, specifically in the realm of generated writing, still absolutely requires enough human involvement to justify copyrighting or otherwise claiming the work as an author. I can&#39;t speak to the future of copyrighting, but at least for the immediate future, I believe that AI is just another tool. Photographers can use photoshop&#39;s AI to remove backgrounds and generate pieces of an image that were not originally there, the newest tools of AI that can generate images or blocks of text based on human inputed prompts, are still just simply tools to be utilized to aid, enhance or speed up the creative process.
