I am deeply concerned by hypocritical court rulings found between the fields of photography and AI-assisted imagery generation. Why is a photograph -- created by a camera -- considered a human-created work, but an AI image -- created by image diffusion software -- is not? If the answer is that in photography there are qualities of tool, composition, framing selection, subject, background, and lighting, all of these qualities are exactly chosen by the human author of an AI image prompt. The court is creating a laughably paradoxical stance that clearly favors one form of technology tool over the other, thereby demonstrating a complete lack of technological understanding that is frankly embarrassing and indicative of rulings that are made through ignorance and personal feelings, rather than findings of law.
