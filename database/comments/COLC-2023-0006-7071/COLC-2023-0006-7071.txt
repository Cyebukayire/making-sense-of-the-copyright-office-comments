(1) the use of copyrighted works to train AI models; <br/><br/>- This is stealing and plagiarizing. We can dress it up in any way and argue semantics about getting authors approval or paying them a paltry sum for their work or whatever else, but the only way these machines learn is by absorbing information and regurgitating a poor simulacrum of it.<br/><br/>- Legitimizing AIs and allowing them to use copyrighted materials is legitimizing knockoffs, plain and simple.<br/><br/>- When a human creator makes something, there is a story they are yearning to tell. It is something that has been in their head trying to break through onto the page or screen, they have a drive to create the thing and make it real and make it extant and share it with the world. When an AI creates a thing it is a soulless money grab, the lowest possible function intended to create a worthless product and try to fool people into paying money for it. There is no soul, no passion. The computer has no ideas in its head yearning to break out. It&rsquo;s a hack tool used by those who can&rsquo;t make anything themselves because they don&rsquo;t see any media as worthwhile. <br/><br/>(2) the copyrightability of material generated using AI systems;<br/> <br/>- There should be no copyright protections for AI generated work. A product made by an AI is itself a poor copy of an idea. No actual work has gone into creating it, it is not an organic idea, and it is not distinct or unique from anything else in the field it is created, by its very nature of learning by imitation.<br/><br/>- The best AI generated material is going to be a poor knockoff of a genuine production. <br/><br/>- When a human author maliciously plagiarizes media or uses existing material as a basis for their creation, or creates something as an homage to existing media; the correlation is there. Maliciously or lovingly connected, the connection is there when the human makes the thing, when it is advertised, when it is consumed by an audience, the connection or the spirit is there. That connection is intentional, it&rsquo;s a deliberate act by the human creator. When an AI copies existing media, it hoovers it up without emotion or logic or feeling, it is simply data brought in to be repackaged and exported. It is not attempting an homage, or a retelling. That existing media is nothing more than fuel.<br/><br/>- An AI is a tool. It&rsquo;s a machine. It has no claim to a copyright more than a laptop or a pencil does. It didn&rsquo;t make anything, it was used by a human to create something that human was not talented enough to make themselves. It&rsquo;s a cheap hack.<br/><br/>(3) potential liability for infringing works generated using AI systems;<br/><br/>- The same liability as deliberate plagiarism or creation of knockoffs.<br/><br/>- As mentioned above, AI only learns via plagiarism and copying and regurgitating. It learns from what it consumes and it recreates cheap imitations of that consumption. That reality cannot be separated from the malicious intent of the actor using an AI, it&rsquo;s not an attempt to create something new, it&rsquo;s an attempt to copy and steal, and should be treated as such.<br/><br/>- AI is a scourge, and unfortunately one that won&rsquo;t be going away anytime soon. The harshest liability, and strong copyright protections of human made work are the best protections we can put forth to create a strong foundation moving into the future to protect human made content.<br/><br/>(4) the treatment of generative AI outputs that imitate the identity or style of human artists.<br/><br/>- The best idea in my opinion is to smash those machines with hammers. But I know that is an unlikely course of action.<br/><br/>- This is a malicious act. It&rsquo;s plagiarism. It can never be an homage or a retelling or a blending of different bits of different pieces of media, because the AI does not have that spirit to see a story and the drive to create it in those ways. An AI doesn&rsquo;t have that kernel of an idea in their head trying to break free, it doesn&rsquo;t have the love or reference for the source material it is making an homage too, any media is just fuel for the fire of AI.<br/><br/>- AI is a tool used to make cheap copies of art, used by malicious actors to separate customers from their money who don&rsquo;t know any better. The people using AI have no understanding of what makes good art or what connects with people, they see it as content, as something to be cheaply mass produced. They are not one artist pouring time and effort into a collection of works they believe in, they&rsquo;re a factory producing nothing in the hopes it will make them money along the way. They&rsquo;re the fidget spinners of content, a cheap piece of crap that&rsquo;s entertaining for at most a minute before being tossed aside to clutter the landscape.<br/>
