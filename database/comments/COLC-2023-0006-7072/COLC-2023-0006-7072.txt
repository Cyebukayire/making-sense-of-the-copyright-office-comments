AI has already been used to deceive my readers into buying a book that appeared similar to my work but published by a Kylie G Scott. The market is being flooded with AI books making it harder than ever for writers to earn a living through their labor. Our work is being devalued and falsified by AI trained on our stolen work. It is a truly horrible situation and an ethical nightmare.
