I do think that the input of a prompt might count as the original intellectual conceptions of an author, but the issue with the training data is, in my opinion, more pertinent to the problems with copyright.  <br/>It is of my opinion that the use of AI to create media ought to be held to the same standards as other transformative works&mdash;that is to say, I think it ought to be held to Fair Use unless all the material used to train the AI are original content by the user of the AI or all the material is within the public domain. I am uncertain if works based on the public domain ought to be able to apply for copyright, but artists that use their own art to train an AI ought to be able to copyright that work if they so desire. <br/>I cannot see the ability to copyright a specific style of art ending well, as people commonly develop similar styles of artwork or the same style. It would end badly if people were to claim copyright over the a photorealistic art style.
