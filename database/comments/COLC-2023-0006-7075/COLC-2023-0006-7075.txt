I feel that AI must be regulated. I am a writer, and I post my hard work online for free. Currently, it is perfectly legal for AI platforms to mine my writing without my consent and use it to write their own content. The same can be said for AI art. I believe that all AI content must be generated based on submissions from people who gave clear and written consent, not datamining. I appreciate you taking the time to read this, and to putting in the effort to keep this world a safe place for content creators. Have a wonderful day.
