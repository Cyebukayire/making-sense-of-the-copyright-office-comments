AI, or applied statistics, should be treated in much the same way as software algorithms. No one could go to a random number generator tool, click the button to generate the number 8402, and then claim that 8402 is a copyrighted number. 1) Copyrighted works should not be used to train AI without the copyright holder&#39;s permission. 2) Material created by AI should not be able to be copyrighted. I would allow that if less than 10% of the work was AI generated, it could be copyrighted-creators should be allowed to use AI to spark an idea, but not to create the idea. 3) The developers of the system and dataset should be held mostly liable for generated content infringing upon copyright, because they are the ones defining the parameters of the datasets. The AI tool cannot choose to go beyond the scope of what the developer set for it. The user prompting the output should only be liable if the prompt can be proven to try and take copyrighted datasets in bad faith, e.g. &quot;generate an impressionist painting of a close up of water lilies in the style of Monet&#39;s water lilies&quot;. 4) AI should not be allowed to mimic voices, likenesses, and styles of artists and performers. The potential for libel alone should make the case against this, let alone the age of misinformation we live in and the willingness of companies to avoid fair compensation if they could mimic someone with impunity.
