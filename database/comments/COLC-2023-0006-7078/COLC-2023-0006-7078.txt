Ten of my copyrighted books written under my pseudonym Kylie Brant have been used without my consent or previous knowledge according to the Atlantic&#39;s Book 3 article. This is a frightening time for creative artists, and it really appears that copyright is rapidly becoming meaningless in the US. If companies can use copyrighted material to make a new product, which they then monetize, how is that fair to the writer? This practice is ripping off writers, their agents, and publishers.--Kim Bahnsen
