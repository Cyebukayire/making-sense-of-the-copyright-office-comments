My name is Erin La Rosa and I&rsquo;m the author of The Big Redhead Book, which is a published work of nonfiction from St. Martin&rsquo;s Press. I labored over this book&mdash;which includes months of research, personal essays, interviews, and original artwork. It is not acceptable to use my intellectual property to train AI without my permission, or any kind of compensation. As an artist and author, taking what I&rsquo;ve created and using it to try and replace me is just&hellip;cruel.
