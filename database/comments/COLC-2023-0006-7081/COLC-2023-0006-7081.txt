Hi,<br/><br/>I am not an expert on pretty much anything, but I do know that it is vital that we keep AI ministrations to the mundane, non-creative, dangerous tasks that humans shouldn&#39;t be doing. Send the robots into Chernobyl to clean up, into the oceans to analyze effective ways to remove oil, have them digitize our public records and streamline cross-county law enforcement to catch serial rapists but do not allow them to create art. <br/><br/>I love libraries and human stories, I love art and theater and TV and film, but I don&#39;t want creative work to be shunted into the AI-sphere away from living breathing humans who have had lives and experiences that should be reflected in their creations.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope it made sense. I hope you can tell that I am a person, reaching through to you, engaging you to weigh in on a genuinely human issue. <br/><br/>All my best,<br/><br/>Leora
