I&#39;ll say what most artists are gonna say, if anyone is using my art for anything commercial, I should be payed for it. While collages would usually be considered fair use I think it&#39;s important to note that a collage usually has a: a person with thoughts and intentions behind it and b: no intention to take jobs away from the people they are taking pieces of said collage from.  I should be able to confidently display my art without fear that data scrapers will use it to make people think it&#39;s worth nothing.
