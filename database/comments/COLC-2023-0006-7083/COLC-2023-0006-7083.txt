AI has given us a lot. From superimposing a deceased actor&#39;s face to finish the movie they had been filming, to apps like Snapchat using fun filters, to &quot;smart devices&quot; like Google home or Amazon&#39;s Alexa. However AI should not be used to take the place of the art and creativity associated with writing. Artificial Intelligence cannot think for itself. There are so many brilliant minds out there who deserve the chance to allow their light to shine. If we start using AI for everything, there will be nothing creatively for the humans to do. Everyone needs a creative outlet. We aren&#39;t machines, and we shouldn&#39;t be replaced by them either.
