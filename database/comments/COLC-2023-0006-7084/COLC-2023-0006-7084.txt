I believe that AI documents should not be copyrighted. The systems were trained using countless other people&#39;s works, many of whom did not consent to have their work be used. If I was to plagiarize someone&#39;s work, they could then sue me. However, it is impossible for all of the originators to determine which person owns more of the work. Therefore, I believe that it can be used to create a work, but that work itself must be open to anyone else using it. It should not be copyrighted. I have heard countless stories of authors and artists having their work stolen without consent; on the other hand, art sites and online ebook stores have been overrun by AI work to the point that it&#39;s impossible to find original work that isn&#39;t drowned out. And if you do, it will be stolen anyway.<br/><br/>AI has been helpful in filling out standardized forms though. It&#39;s similar to filling out a form; it plugs in information that I have or gathered to create a document that fulfills the arbitrary rules of whatever I have to submit it to. It&#39;s like the old citation generators--you still have to gather the information yourself. It&#39;s a useful assistant, but cannot be used to create.
