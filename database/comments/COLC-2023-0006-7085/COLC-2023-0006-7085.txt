 Dear US Copyright Office,<br/><br/> First of all, before going into my further comments on the topic, I want to thank you on your previous rulings, sincerely. I fully mean it; not giving copyright to the algorithmicly generated works was the right call and it shows that it was a well thought out, educated decision. It most likely had saved creatives from further headache, more than they already have right now. And we have full confidence in you once again making the correct ruling that will protect the providers.<br/><br/> As for my comment: it only makes sense for the ruling of no copyright to generative machine learning to be upheld indefinitely. It&rsquo;s only for the better since it only has benefits; with the method of spamming, copyright hoarding would have turned into a nightmare relatively quick, with some people trying to claim ownership of everything they get generated.<br/><br/> But when it comes to works that are based on what was generated by a model but had substantial editing done on them; even if the result is copyright-able, that should not mean that the base also could. I personalty visualize the proposal like this: thinking the initially untouched generation and the editing done on it as separate layers on a drawing software, what&rsquo;s left after the layer carrying the first is made invisible should be the only parts of the work that one can claim ownership of. Giving protections to whole untouched version of a generated material just because there is version of it that has enough editing done on it would only work as a way of bypassing your basis on what can and can&rsquo;t be done with machine learning. Another thing that should be mentioned is that editing and customization done on such materials using machine learning apparatus like ControlNet or Image-2-Image should not be counted as editing at all; results may be heavy guided, but it&rsquo;s not unlike commissioning with extreme specificity and micro managing.<br/><br/>  Anyway, I think this will be all until now, but I would gladly comment on behalf of my community  if asked again. I know it was short but what we are asking for and what matters to us is not that complex. I&rsquo;ll like to thank you again for allowing us to voice our concerns! I just know that it matters and you will be taking it into consideration.
