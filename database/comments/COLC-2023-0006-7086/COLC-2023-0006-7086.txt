Hello,<br/><br/>I believe that the use of copyrighted works in training AI models, even when works are posted publically, and the possibility of granting works created by generative models copyright protections pose a significant danger to the livelihoods and treatment of those who put incredible time and effort towards their art.<br/><br/>As we have seen from the recent SAG/AFTRA strike studios are eager to reduce the already meager compensation they give to the people who are critical in producing every form of entertainment by having them sift through whatever ill-conceived jumble these models create. In the last decade as media made the transition from streaming being a complementary source to the main way it is distributed studios took advantage of the model change to reduce or even cheat their works of rightful compensation. As writers lost much of the money they relied on to pay the bills we saw a precipitous decline in the quality and depth of storylines. After all, given that the writer on an episode that reaches tens of millions of viewers is paid similarly to one that reaches a few hundred thousand why spend the effort on a better storyline when you could write several milquetoast stories that earn them barely enough to pay their rent.<br/><br/>However, the drawbacks to using AIs extend beyond their use in film, TV, and a bored English student&#39;s essay. Models like DALL-E 2 and services derived from them have been shown off creating Van Gogh look-alikes and the absurd such as Adam Driver as the Queen of England or cat-shaped turtles. These images are possible due to the mass, unwilling scraping of works made by actual artists to feed into these models. As a result, many of these models are being used to create images that would otherwise be commissioned and help those artists.<br/><br/>These examples do leave out one of the more popular examples of the dangers of AIs, faking the appearances and/or the voices of real people to disparage them. We have already seen them used to make believable recreations of the voices of celebrities and presidents in situations absurd enough to make it clear to any viewer that it is fake. While currently, these models wouldn&#39;t be able to convince a discerning ear it likely won&#39;t be long before they are barely noticeable from the real person. At that point, it will only be a matter of time until someone decides to spend the effort on manipulating someone into giving up valuable information or faking what someone says to disparage them.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my comment and I hope it helps inform the creation of proper limitations on the use of generative AIs in the creative fields.
