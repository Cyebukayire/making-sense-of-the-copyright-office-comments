Without human efforts, time, and labor, AI cannot create. Which is to say, without the works &#39;sampled&#39; to &#39;train&#39; an AI, it cannot function. It simply cannot create something from nothing.<br/><br/>Without theft - because, in the most simple of terms, that is what it is at the end of the day - AI cannot produce a result. Thus the question, in this way, becomes &quot;Should something that can only exist by merit of wide-scale theft be able to be Copyrighted?&quot;<br/><br/>In the shortest answer, No.<br/><br/>To grant that protection to someone who&#39;s product they did not create themselves, which was only able to be fabricated by the means of a machine&#39;s intellect to take hundreds of thousands of images and rehash them over and over and over until the user deemed it complete, is nothing short of insulting to those who&#39;s work and time and love was butchered to &#39;create&#39; such a product. The people who use AI to &#39;create&#39; artwork (be it visual or written) respect no other authors, companies, or artist; they blatantly scoff at the protections others have over their work. They decry more active measures to protect one&#39;s work - most notable among them the outrage over &quot;poisoning databases&quot; by visual artists protecting their images with the usage of GLAZE (file attached).<br/><br/>AI &#39;artists&#39; are not artists. The ability to copyright something stolen should never be granted.<br/><br/>If you cannot put in the love and effort and pain one must dedicate to create, you have no claim to the outcome.<br/><br/>If you cannot cite your sources, you have no claim to the outcome, no matter how far you have twisted what it began as.<br/><br/>If you must stoop so low as to scrapping entire narratives and dialog and poems to train an AI how to write because you yourself cannot write, you have no claim to the outcome.<br/><br/>If you possess the nerve to refute the negative consequences of your actions, yet would declare yourself owed the protection and profits of the positive?<br/><br/>You have no claim to anything.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>GLAZE&#39;s website, specifically the subsection wherein all publications (academic and otherwise) are located:<br/>https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/media.html<br/>
