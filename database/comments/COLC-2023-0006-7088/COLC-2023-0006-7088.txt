If and when we create true AI, I&#39;d be happy to grant them these rights. But an algorithm is an intelligence like a factory robot arm is an employee. It&#39;s not. This is just more corporate greed, looking for ways to make money without supporting actual artists and writers and creators. These programs cannot create, because they only recycle what already exists.
