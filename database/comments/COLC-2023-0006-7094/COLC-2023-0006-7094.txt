Ai-Generated content shouldn&#39;t be copyrightable under the guise that someone does simple prompting or minimum effort such as asking ChatGPT to make a poem, and text-to-image/video/audio prompts. Such methods require little human intervention and the outcome is neigh uncontrollable. Secondly, without disclosure of training data the person seeking copyright shouldn&#39;t be able to copyright the outputs since they may have used another person&#39;s/entity&#39;s published works to train a model. However, there may be leeway, say a visual artist trains a model on their own art and then uses Ai as a render engine, may then be copyrightable. Ie, Draw a character to near completion, then have an ai model (stable diffusion) touch up the anatomy and rendering. Under such a case, copyright might have leeway.
