I have been a hardworking published author since 2001 and I am highly concerned about the invasion of AI in my career field. All of my work is under copyright. I have never been asked permission to use any of my work to train AI, and would never give permission for my work to be used. But a quick search found this extensive list of my titles being used without my permission and without any compensation to train AI programs.The following are my copyrighted titles being used without permission:<br/> Awakened: A House of Night Novel<br/>Destined: A House of Night Novel<br/>Dragon&#39;s Oath<br/>Hidden: A House of Night Novel (House of Night Novels, 10)<br/>Hunted (House of Night, Book 5): A House of Night Novel<br/>Kalona&#39;s Fall: A House of Night Novella (House of Night Novellas, 4)<br/>Lenobia&#39;s Vow: A House of Night Novella (House of Night Novellas, 2)<br/>Loved<br/>Neferet&#39;s Curse: A House of Night Novella (House of Night Novellas, 3)<br/>Redeemed: A House of Night Novel (House of Night Novels)<br/>Revealed: A House of Night Novel<br/>Eternal: More Love Stories with Bite<br/>Goddess of Legend (Goddess Summoning Book 7)<br/>Goddess of Light (Goddess Summoning Book 3)<br/>Goddess of Spring (Goddess Summoning, Book 2)<br/>Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning Book 4)<br/>Marked (House of Night, Book 1)<br/>Moon Chosen: Tales of a New World<br/>Divine By Mistake<br/>This must stop. Using copyrighted work without permission and compensation is pirating. Artificial Intelligence should not be trained by stealing from published authors. It&#39;s a travesty and devastating to publishers, authors and our families.
