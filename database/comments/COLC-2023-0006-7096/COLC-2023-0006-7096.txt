I think AI is a horribke abuse of resources and power that is an inherent misuse of other people&#39;s work. AI art is not real art. AI shows are not real. Art comes from the memory and feelings in it&#39;s creation, and the person behind that art. AI not only destroys that and steals jobs, and thus SHOULD NOT BE COPYRIGHTABLE, it also STEALS THE WORK OF REAL ARTISTS.
