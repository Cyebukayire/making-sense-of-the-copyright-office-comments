Hi, <br/><br/>I&#39;m a pretty small, amateur artist. I mostly make photo edits and occasionally draw very unskilled things. But I have done a lot of writing, since I was very young, and posted much of it online (though OCD has also caused me to delete a good chunk of it over the years and part of that is related to art theft fear). I couldn&#39;t get some of it taken down if I tried because I can&#39;t prove I ever owned the accounts under which they&#39;re posted. <br/><br/>That said, I&#39;m not very familiar with a lot of the legal jargon involved in this. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people with varying qualifications talk about this from artists directly affected by the cons to people defending it despite all of that. I think in truth it&#39;s a nuanced topic, but I lean heavier with people against it. <br/><br/>I don&#39;t like that things that took me hours, days, weeks, or even years can be taken and used without my consent. Copyright or not, (although I want to stress that the copyright aspect of this is important to me) there&#39;s a lot of theft of digital art and writing already and it&#39;s hard to fight it without introducing semi-smart machines into the mix. <br/><br/>That&#39;s not to say I think AI art and writing programs lack value in some ways. Using intellectual property that doesn&#39;t belong to any of the people operating the AI just feels like an obvious no-go to me, but that&#39;s one opinion. I know some people feel it&#39;s just a bad idea altogether and I don&#39;t think I know enough about copyright and all of that to debate that point. <br/><br/>I believe their feelings are valid, especially because a lot of them have been burned by the whole art or writing theft issue. I&#39;m not popular enough for that to be a problem for me (or, at least not to be recognized if it was, so I wouldn&#39;t know), but I know people or know of people who have been affected. They must be very hurt and angry by it. I know I would be, and I think their perspective on that is valuable and I don&#39;t want to challenge it. <br/><br/>As far as the rest goes, I&#39;m not sure I can answer the more technical questions. I have my own (limited) experience, but I think it&#39;s important to have as many voices contribute to this as possible. This is a big deal for the future of art and writing, and I believe we deserve to maintain autonomy over our intellectual property, regardless of whether it qualifies for copyright protection. I also believe there are people far more qualified to elaborate on why, so I will be leaving it to them. <br/><br/>I hope this commentary brings only constructive responses; I&#39;d like to think it can be a good tool when applied within reason, but I want people to come first always. A robot is not worth this many artists losing income and security nets.
