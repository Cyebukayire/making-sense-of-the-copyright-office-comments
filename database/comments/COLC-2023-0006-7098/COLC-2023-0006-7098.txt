There are several reasons to deny copyright to images and text that are generated using &quot;scraped&quot; internet data. <br/><br/>The first and most important is that the scrape is performed without the consent, credit, or compensation of the humans who created the scraped works.  Many times, that information was not placed on the internet with the consent of the creator in the first place (such as with pirated works) and for all of them, there was no way for them to opt out of a technology that did not exist at the time. <br/><br/>Second, the well-documented tendency of &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; to &quot;hallucinate&quot; will causea significant degradation of the ability to find trustworthy information. This is not limited to the internet; it&#39;s well-documented that internet hoaxes can easily find their way into mainstream journalism. Granting copyright to algorithmically generated material will only exacerbate that problem; and once the scrapers start ingesting this material, the autocoprophagous effects would only accelerate. <br/><br/>I&#39;m sure others have articulated these reasons better than I have. Please listen to them.
