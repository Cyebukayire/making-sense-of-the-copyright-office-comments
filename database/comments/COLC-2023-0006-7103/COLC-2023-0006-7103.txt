I believe that the growing area of generative AI needs increased investigation, transparency, and regulation. While the technologies have potential for great use, it also has great potential for great misuse, and some of that misuse is happening now. The current methods and policies for how the systems gather their data from many personal and copyrighted works, violating the owners&#39; rights without permission nor compensation. The systems operate on unclear consent. The burden is placed on creators to opt out, something they have to do manually and possibly multiple times. The process should be reversed; all data out of public domain should be considered automatically opted out, and creators can then choose to make their data available. And the way these systems work to generate the outputs is unknown. Increased transparency on how they work is needed for future policies and guidelines to be fairly applied.
