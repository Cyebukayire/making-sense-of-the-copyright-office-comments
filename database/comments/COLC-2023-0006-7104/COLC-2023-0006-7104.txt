Please do not allow AI generated work to be copyrighted.  AI is not creating working from &#39;scratch&#39; - it has to be trained by existing sources and often, works of visual art are merely &#39;photo basing&#39; - ie. compositing various, per-existing work, into a &#39;new&#39; piece.  Which I consider it to be a work of derivation, which would need its original creator&#39;s consent. In addition, many artists have a particular &#39;style&#39; that is recognizable.  If famous people can protect their images, artists should be able to do the same with their artistic work.
