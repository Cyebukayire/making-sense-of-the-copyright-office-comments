As a member of a creative industry, I implore the U.S. federal government to regulate artificial intelligence in creative industries. I do not want my work to be used to train A.I. and if that is allowed, I worry that my career, and the careers of my friends and colleagues will enter into the sands of history. <br/>If our bosses could use A.I. to replace us, using our own art to train artificial intelligence, it will be the end of our industries and careers that many of us spent decades to create. Please regulate A.I.
