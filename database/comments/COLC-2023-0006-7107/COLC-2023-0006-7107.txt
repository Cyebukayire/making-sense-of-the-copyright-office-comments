Hi, I am a writer with The Animation Guild. I want to voice my support to put limitations on AI and Generative AI. My writing is my job and my creativity is how I make my living. For companies to use my work to train their AI and large language models without acknowledging my ownership of the work and without compensating me, is theft. And if companies are allowed to steal the work of writers and artists to train AI, which then eventually replaces those jobs would be devastating for this country&#39;s jobs and economy.
