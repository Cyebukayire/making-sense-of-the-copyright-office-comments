I&rsquo;m the author of 11 published works. I wrote them because I had stories I wanted to tell, informed by my unique perspective and experience. I wrote them to entertain and amuse readers. Publishers bought and published them. I have not made a living&mdash;or a wage sufficient to compensate me for the research, talent, and effort that went into my work, but that&rsquo;s okay: I wrote in the hope that readers would be touched in some way by my words. What I did not do was prepare, without compensation, books that would be used to train AI that would then be used to make poorer versions of work that I and many more talented writers produce.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m not anti AI&mdash;but I am totally against the wholesale, uncompensated, appropriation of copyrighted material written to reach the hearts and minds of humans.
