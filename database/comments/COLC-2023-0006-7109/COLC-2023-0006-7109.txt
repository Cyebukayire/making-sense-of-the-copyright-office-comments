Please do not allow AI generated work to be copyright-able or allow it to be trained using existing artwork.  AI work is currently a synthesis of existing work - it&#39;s just taking bits and pieces from existing work and then calling it &#39;new&#39;. If a human person just took pieces from someone else&#39;s work and did the same thing, there would be potential lawsuits from copyright violations.  AI should not be treated differently.
