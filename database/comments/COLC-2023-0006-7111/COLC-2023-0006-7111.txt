As a working artist, I believe generative AI presents a real threat to the entire creative industry and the livelihoods of all workers in these industries. Besides the economic threats, there are also moral and philosophical questions at play if an AI is allowed to be treated as as much of an author as a human author. If AI is allowed to run rampant, I predict our future media landscape will become a jumbled landscape of incomprehensible junk that is just regurgitated and reprocessed from the labor and creativity of actual humans. I think it will be bad not only for creators but also for consumers because computer labor will always be cheaper than human labor, but I think the quality will be much, much worse. But I don&#39;t think corporations care, they will simply saturate the market with bad quality news, media, writing, and art. As long as they are the biggest fish in the pond it simply doesn&#39;t matter how bad the &quot;content&quot; they create is, the barrier of entry to get to any other content will simply be too high and they will have their captive audience. And it will just become too hard and too expensive for any human with the urge to create to try to make anything that is good, truthful, meaningful, or artistic&hellip; this is not a world I want to live in. Nor is it a world I or my creative industry coworkers can live in.
