As a working artist I am deeply concerned with the state of AI programs and it&#39;s data sets. It takes the work and experience of someone like me and does not compensate me and at the same time lessens my ability to make a living. As a person of color I am also concerned about the unregulated and sometimes gross implementation of the AI tools. Work I have seen as an art director used by creating AI is often simplistic and at times clearly racist. Such large data sets seem to make imagery without concern for morals, or any grounding in peoples lives or reality. But it will do it in a way that convinces some people that it is in fact the truth. I am concerned for the value of artist and art but also how this technology if left unchecked will have the ability to warp our sensitivity as a society.
