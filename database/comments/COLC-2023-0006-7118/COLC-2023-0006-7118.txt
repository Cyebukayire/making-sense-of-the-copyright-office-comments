(Question 9) Our current business includes programming generators that create novel content without direct human guidance.<br/><br/>We build these generators manually or from works where we already hold the copyright. We believe these generators are themselves clearly derivative works and that creating such a generator from a copyrighted work would be in violation. This is despite the fact that directly reproducing a copyrighted work would be astronomically unlikely to the point of impossibility.<br/><br/>Machine learning simply streamlines the task of producing these generators. Reducing the human labor in building the generator does not make it any less a derivative work, it just makes it cheaper.<br/><br/>The idea that they would need to specifically opt-out of our use of their works is truly bizarre. Copyrights can be purchased or rights can be licensed to create derivative works.<br/><br/>(Question 18) Whether the text created by these generators is itself copyrighted is, in our estimation, tied to how large a block of text is being directly reproduced. For example, a human might have added a list of words or a list of sentences. The sentences, it seems fair to say, should maintain that human&#39;s copyright. Meanwhile, a collection of individual words put together by the generator should not gain any more copyright than was granted to the creator of magnetic poetry back in the 90s.<br/><br/>The end user should be judged under the same criteria. Are substantial parts of the work their own words? If not, there&#39;s no reason to consider them as an author.<br/><br/>Similarly, it&#39;s common to send prompts, outlines, and feedback to authors and artists. I gain no copyright for telling an artist what I want to see, no matter how much I micromanage them. They can sell us the rights, certainly, but providing prompts granting rights is a very dangerous precedent across all creative endeavors.<br/><br/>(Closing) Thanks for your time and consideration. This is a complex issue, we appreciate you investigating it thoroughly.
