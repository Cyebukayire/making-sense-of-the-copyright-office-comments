As an artist, I&#39;ve spent years working on my craft. To have that craft taken by a machine (without my permission) to then make a new image someone totally random might profit from-- really hurts! We already have such little copyright protection online and these new generative tools take even more from us. If a database is able to obtain permission from artists (and better yet, pay them) I&#39;m happy to have generative tools in people&#39;s hands, but we know most of these sites and applications do not ask permission and even take work from recently dead artists. Just like how a monkey can hold copyright for it&#39;s painting, something made by a machine cannot have copyright either. Humans should be the only ones able to have copyright and to profit from their own work. I should not have to live in fear posting online thinking &quot;Will a machine scrape this and put money into the pocket of someone else?&quot; Machine generated images hurt artists, that&#39;s it!
