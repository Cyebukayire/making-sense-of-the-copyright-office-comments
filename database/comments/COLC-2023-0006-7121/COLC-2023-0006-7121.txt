A.I has been a problem since it truly began to gain popularity only a few years ago. When regarding A.I, a fancy version of copy and paste, regulations were forced in place for the music industry to protect audio artists world wide so that their copyright would be safe. The problem here is the double standard and lack of appreciation of visual arts. Midjourney alone scratched from sites such as Deviant Art, Artstation. Etc. Sites that within their own terms of use state that posting there is submission of the user&#39;s copyright. That to use the page *protects* the user, but also hefts out punishment for anyone attempting copyright infringement. Midjourney had absolutely no right or the consent to take from over 30 million artists, and place it within an engine that does not have the ability to forget. Artists like myself, Sam Yang, Wang Lee AKA. WLOP, Guweiz, and many more, have all become victims of copyright infringement. Strawman arguments from people who lack the common sense and claim, &quot;by posting on the internet you gave all of us permission to use it. (Your art.)&quot; Which if that were true then movies, music, and so much more would be distributed and everyone&#39;s copyright would be null and void. - which we know better than this. A.I art **NEEDS** to be regulated. A great example would be to look at a small company in Russia that uses a.i to generate art. If an artist&#39;s style or work is wished to be used, then they will go and ASK. FOR. CONSENT. - and if the artist says no- which they have every right to, then they will NOT. USE. THEIR. WORK. <br/><br/>A.I art would benefit strongly from an Opt IN system and not an OPT out. Only those who willingly place their art into the engine shall have their art be used as tools for the big artificial brain. <br/><br/>The engine we have now should be given a mass wipe, deleted and then rebooted but the proper way. With each individual artist used&#39;s consent. If companies like Midjourney some reason can&#39;t find the funds or the time to do so, then they need not boot up their engine in the first place. <br/><br/>This aside, I do want to make clear that A.I art - A.I in general - could be an amazing tool if used responsibly. It could truly benefit everyone, but with it&#39;s current state it is unmoral and unethical to partake in due to the fraud and copyright infringement. If it had the foundation that wasn&#39;t tainted and scummy, it would make an amazing site for artists of all kinds to come together to use and make great references. I wish to emphasize **References.** A.I art should never be used as the final product or be allowed to be used in official works. If art is created via A.I then it is soley for studying and research purposes and placed under Common Use.
