Dear Regulations.gov,<br/><br/>Works created by Artificial Intelligence SHOULD NOT be able to be copyrighted. Copyright is for human authorship only.<br/><br/>Any copyrighted work denotes intent. A machine or Ai does not have intent in what it makes, no matter how complex the finished work may be. <br/><br/>Finally, many Ai programs were fed copyrighted content from human authors and artists without their consent, making them, and anything they create, inherently unethical. Their works should not be given copyright protections either.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>
