Hi, <br/>There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.&nbsp; Therefore, while a work is under copyright, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.&nbsp; To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies. Thank you for you consideration of public comments on this topic.
