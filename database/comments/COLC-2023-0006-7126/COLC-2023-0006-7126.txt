Artificial Intelligence is a tool that can vastly improve the efficiency and advancements of humanity but if it is not treated with thorough ethics and proper regulations is can become a disruptive tool that will create unemployment in the millions. As an academic tool, harnessed by researchers and scientists it has the potential to bring humanity into a new era, but as an unregulated vehicle for capital driven businesses it will become a weapon of blind unemployment. I support the American Governments use of this technology within the conscious application of the sciences and technology but deeply implore they create rigid and unbending boundaries against its use to displace the American workforce. I fear we will see a modern age economic genocide if we allow businesses and other economic ventures to utilize these tools to their whim and desire to obtain maximal capital gains.
