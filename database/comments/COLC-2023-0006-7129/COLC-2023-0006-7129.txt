Part of the point of copyright is to protect the author&rsquo;s rights around the work in question. To me it is inherently contradictory to allow third parties to use copyrighted works to train an AI without an author&rsquo;s permission, then to have the AI user&rsquo;s rights over the AI-generated works to be protected instead. This system allows for theft and remixing of an author&rsquo;s work and then gives more protection to the thief than to the original owner. To me, several things logically flow from thinking of the issue in this way:<br/>1. Copyrighted works should only be in a training dataset on an opt-in basis, otherwise the issues I described above would occur.<br/>2. The AI should not be legally protected as a copyright holder, and (to make this distinction more obvious to casual consumers/readers/viewers) works being copyrighted which include AI-generated elements should be marked as containing AI-generated material, and if possible with which AI was used.
