AI art is inherently in violation of copyright, by the value that they are trained on data that was not given with proper permission/rights. Without said data, these models would not be able to produce things. These models have reproduced watermarks of various stock photo websites, artist signatures, and other identifying marks, however mangled, from prompts. These learning models are a travesty of intellectual property rights, and a danger to the average consumer.
