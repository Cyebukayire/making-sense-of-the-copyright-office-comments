I am a graphic designer and illustrator whose livelihood is being threatened by AI. Instead of coming to me to create whole designs that meet a creative brief and paying me accordingly for my time, experience, and expertise, clients are instead creating quick illustrations/designs through AI and then hiring me to make final refinements of AI-rendered works for a greatly discounted fee. This is taking from my income and potential clients, and invalidating my education.
