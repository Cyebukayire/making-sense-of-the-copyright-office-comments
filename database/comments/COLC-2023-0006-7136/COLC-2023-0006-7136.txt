While I think there is always an argument to be made involving fair use when transforming the writings and stories of others, the thing that I end up stuck on is that it is widely known that copyrighted materials exist within these large language models&mdash;and as far as has been brought to light, none of it was paid for. Fundamentally to me, that means that the outputs of these large language models are built on the backs of piracy and unless those who are sourced within the models are duly compensated, their work is being stolen and plagiarized. I think frequently of those ads at the start of movies I have watched over the years: &quot;you wouldn&#39;t download a car.&quot; to prevent the piracy of movies, television shows, and other digital media; so it feels inconsistent to me that it is acceptable to use the output of pirated materials and claim that they&#39;re your own. <br/><br/>Heidi Bond articulated in her own comment a thought better than I have been able to articulate it myself, so I&#39;m copying it here as well:<br/><br/>&quot;When asking LLMs to generate prompts, humans will tell it subject matter. A human using an LLM to create a book undoubtedly provides extensive input: &ldquo;rewrite this so that the protagonist is a werewolf instead of a vampire&rdquo; or &ldquo;tighten this section&rdquo; or &ldquo;expand this part to explain his motive.&rdquo;<br/> <br/>This kind of content, however extensive it may be, is functionally editorial rather than expressive: it directs someone else to make alterations to a story.<br/> <br/>The reason for this is rooted in the concept of copyright as protecting expression. The act of authorship is one that transforms ideas into expression. An editor largely provides ideas&mdash;things like changing a protagonists job, or changing the turning point of a book. These ideas are not protected by copyright, and therefore, an editor, even if valuable and needed to the process, is not the author of the work.<br/> <br/>Large language models are a machine for turning ideas into expression. A human does generate a large number of ideas to put into the machine. But this is functionally equivalent to an editor calling for an article on a particular topic and then suggesting edits to the work.&quot;
