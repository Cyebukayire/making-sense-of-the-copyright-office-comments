Hello I am an artist and graphic designer and I am absolutely positive that at some point in time my designs I have stolen and used to train AI without my consent. With an AI generator there is almost no way to see if it has generated an image (or text) that is too close to content that it was trained on and become plagiarism. I have not heard of nor do I think AI would be able to accurately credit the influence of a design to the group of artist that the it used to generator its own image. I think all platforms that scrap images to train AI generator should have to fully disclose what they are doing to their users and give them the option to opt out of it. <br/><br/>In my opinion there also needs to be a limit on what can be copyrighted when it comes to AI generated writing in TV and movies. This would help prevent exploitation of writers and would prevent studios from union busting and cutting cost at the expense of people&#39;s livelihood as we have seen in the recent writer strike. <br/>Also it brings up question of should a studio be able to trademark a phase in there media that was written by AI or is that in the public domain.
