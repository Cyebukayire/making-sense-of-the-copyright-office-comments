I appreciate the Office&#39;s requesting of public feedback on this pressing topic. I am a supporter and friend of many artists and writers. An important part of democratic society is support for the creation of art and culture. To promote the creation of art, there is a strong policy of allowing artists and authors exclusive rights to their works for a set period of time. Therefore, a work under copyright should not be used to train AI without the consent and compensation of the artist or author. The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training AI on copyrighted works without the consent and compensation of the authors and artists of those works infringes on the rights of said authors and artists. Thank you for your time and consideration.
