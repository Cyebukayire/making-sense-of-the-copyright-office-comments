AI art and scripts and stories and the like aren&rsquo;t any good. They aren&rsquo;t worthy of time or attention. What makes art and stories and all of these things that Ai seems to be learning so great, along with just being good and pretty and skillful, is that they are all undeniably and completely human. You can read something and know the words are a small part of someone&rsquo;s soul, that another human like you sat and wrote this, and you can imagine how, maybe, they wrote it just for you. You can look at art and peer through the eyes of another human person; see their thoughts and feelings through color and shape. Or watching television, knowing a fellow human wrote/filmed/directed/etc this, in the hopes YOU would enjoy it. That their hard work would make you smile, laugh, cry. All of these things for the sake of making them, for the joy of having something they worked hard on, leaving a mark on the world. The purpose of it all, something that can&rsquo;t be replicated or experienced by AI: feeling. Enjoying being human, how strange and wonderful it all is. Something AI will never understand
