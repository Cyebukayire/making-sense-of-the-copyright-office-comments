It is my belief that AI is a tool, like money or stones. It isn&#39;t inherently good or evil, but the way we use it or think about adds a moral component that must not be denied. For this reason, the AI developers must make a rigorous attempt at contacting the current owner of the copyrighted material and come to an agreement about payment and usage before its implementation into the training data. What do I mean by rigorous? I mean that they use every avenue at their disposal to get into contact with the copyright owner. I understand that Fair Use is a possibility, but a creator&#39;s style is not so easily changed so that their future body of work is potentially distinguishable from the AI. It&#39;s one of those things that as AI technology advances, the original creator must still be able to say &quot;I did not make that piece of art/I did not use an AI to make this&quot; and have people believe them. The original intent of copyright is to protect the livelihood of creative minds. There must be guardrails for AI for this reason.
