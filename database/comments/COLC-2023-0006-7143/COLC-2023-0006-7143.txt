Thank you for conducting this study. I am the author of three published graphic novels. I am notably not what would be considered a financially successful author. I am sure you have not heard of my books, but that does not matter. I wrote them, and I stand to make money off of them, but my career as a writer is currently threatened by AI theft and plagiarism.  What writers create should not be, without consent and compensation, mined for the economic benefit of others. I believe the use of AI in the arts must be regulated. Without regulation, many people&#39;s livelihoods will be negatively impacted. Also, if you care about the integrity of the written word and the future of literature, government institutions should protect it and its creators from theft and other abuses. Arts are valuable and necessary. Generative AI solves no existing problems other than replacing already poorly compensated artists with machines. Artistic AI theft and plagiarism hurts hardworking humans, benefits those who seemingly hold no concern about the livelihoods of others, and all for what? I do not believe there is a benefit to anyone other than businesses seeking NOT TO PAY PEOPLE. AI in the arts is theft at best and the end of human expression at worst.
