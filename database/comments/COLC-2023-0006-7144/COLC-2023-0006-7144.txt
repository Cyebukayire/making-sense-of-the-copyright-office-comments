Good evening government person reading this,<br/>In my engineering work, I regularly make use of generative AI to solve problems. It has saved hours on the work I do. However, I feel that the way we find data to &quot;scrape&quot; for generative AI currently is unethical and effectively copies people&#39;s work without their permission. When a generative AI is given data, it uses it as part of a model to make predictions. For example, if you give it the text of Lord of the Rings, and ask it to predict what comes after the word &quot;one&quot;, it will likely say &quot;ring&quot;. This is because it only has one book in its model where &quot;one&quot; is generally followed by &quot;ring&quot;. In our one training document thought experiment, the AI is effectively copying from lord of the Rings. This is clearly a violation of ethical and legal principles. Why should it change when we feed in 1,000 books and it&#39;s copying from all of them?<br/>This varies from field to field. For example, in Computer Science (CS) it is common for any code published online to be used without payment or even credit given to the original author. There is an understanding that code posted online will be reused, and that the reuse of code is a good thing. This is not true in more creative disciplines like writing and art, where plagiarism can ruin a career. We can not yet teach AI these complicated interdisciplinary rules for when it is acceptable to scrape data and when it is not.<br/>My proposed solution is to create an opt-in or opt-out system. In an opt-in system, it is assumed that you do not want your data scraped by AI, but you can check a box to allow it. In an opt-out system, it is assumed that it is ok for AI to scrape your data, but you can mark it as something that should not be used to train AI. Both these systems should be independent of the copyright status of the data, except that you can not scrape copyrighted data for obvious reasons. I want to be clear that despite the serious ethical issues from the nonconsensual scraping of data, these generative AI systems when used ethically, can be a huge boon to STEM, Professional, and Creative people alike.
