I think generative AI can be an asset to creators, but it is currently being used in a destructive way. As technology advances, there is almost no way of telling if something was generated or not. This can cause a lot of confusion to the general public and make it even harder to discern what is real or not. To me, this is very scary and I can see it going south really fast. In terms of how it affects creators looking for jobs, I have already seen a sprinkling of job postings that utilize AI to replace people. These are creative positions that require a lot of skill and mastery that can take years to achieve. It&#39;s not just a vague term like &quot;talent&quot;, but hard work. Not only is it &quot;taking the human-ness out of creativity&quot; but it also directly uses other people&#39;s art, photos, and data to create. In my mind, this is plagiarism. Last I remember, plagiarism was highly frowned upon and could lead to severe consequences. I do not believe anything created by AI has the right to be copyrighted because of how it functions. I believe that generative work should not be able to be directly used for anything. It should solely be a tool for idea generation. Because of the excessive infringement on privacy and already copyrighted works, current AI models are unfit to be utilized in any situation. New models with consented works and those that are already in the public domain need to be created to replace the current models. Individuals using AI systems should not be able to pass off the derived works as their own because it begs the question, who actually made this? Was it the individual, who merely input parameters into the software, was it the software itself, was it the individuals who created the software, or is it the countless creators the software &ldquo;learned&rdquo; from?
