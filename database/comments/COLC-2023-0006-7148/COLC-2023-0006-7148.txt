Hello! My name is Matthew, and I am a small business owner, an engineer, an artist and designer, and a strong believer in the potential and usage of &quot;AI&quot; technologies in the form of generative LLMs.<br/><br/>To suggest that an AI-generated piece does not deserve copyright protections suggests that art exists to serve the medium by which it was created. Does a novel exist to serve the pen that wrote it or the paper it is written on? Decidedly not.<br/><br/>While the 1991 case of Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co. does not establish precedent related to AI, it made clear that factual information itself is not copyrightable, but the expressive form that the information takes is. This establishes the precedent that art protection is tied to the creative expression, not the method by which it is expressed.<br/><br/>Moreover, the level of skill required to create a piece like the award-winning MidJourney piece that started these petitions initially is very high. I&#39;d put a large sum of money to say that most people could not do it; it is a unique talent. Not only would someone have to sit and prompt for hours over hundreds of prompts to address the most minute details, they would also need to further modify the image in something like Photoshop to achieve the artistic level required to even compete, let alone win. In addition, they would need a substantial level of artistic skill and experience. Mass-produced AI art is easily recognizable and is not winning any contents, at least as of today. I say this with the utmost confidence as someone who has spent well over 1000 hours with these systems, including their training and deployment.<br/><br/>Considering that this is a unique skill requiring specific artistic abilities that overlap with the same creativity skills used to, say, paint a portrait, and considering the precedent set in Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co. regarding copyright protections protecting creativity rather than medium, offering copyright protection to AI-generated art is not only in the best interests of the democratization of creativity in general and artists both known and unknown, it is a benefit to our culture, our society, and our advancement as such.<br/><br/>Overall, while certain artists may lose the hammer-lock they have on creativity, serving this interest is not serving the broader interests of our culture or our society. Serving this interest consolidates creativity to those talented enough to draw or paint these images instead of protecting those who posess the creativity in their mind instead of their hands. A disabled person can create mafnificent artworks with generative AI that they could never have before. Their creativity that would have been lost to us is intead found.<br/><br/>To reiterate - art does not exist to serve the medium by which art is created through or displayed upon. It exists to elicit thought and feeling, and to share something that exists in a mind with the world. Based on these qualifications, AI-generated art is no different than painted art and deserves all of the same copyright protections. The owner of any piece of AI generated response should be the person who wrote the prompt that generated the response, full-stop. Artists attempting to gatekeep this technology do so very transparently, in my opinion, to maintain what amounts to their monopoly on these things. I implore you, do not allow a monopoly on creativity. You do so at the peril of our future, our society, and at the cost of invalidating creativity as a mental trait, instead making it a physical talent.<br/><br/>I concede that security and data governance are serious concerns when considering AI legislation, but those legislations should be held in entirely separate measures from copyright protection. They should not be considered here.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time, and I hope I at least gave you pause for thought. Please consider what I have said; this is a pivotal moment in human history.<br/><br/>-Matthew<br/>CEO/CTO<br/>Symbiotic Love
