To whom in may concern,<br/><br/>Re: Artificial Intelligence<br/><br/>Thank you for all your work on our behalf. I am a writer, director, producer and actor. I have been an actor for 30 years and a filmmaker for 12 years. In many ways, I am just beginning to find success and disturbed at the possibility of the end of my business as we know it. I am disturbed by AI and how it is the greatest copyright violation in history. The way generative artificial intelligence models are trained is by ingesting 1000&rsquo;s of copyrighted material - hundreds of years of peoples hard and protected work scanned (stolen) from the internet. This most likely includes paintings, films, books, scripts, photographs, music, etc. that are registered with your office. Copyright&rsquo;s protect an artists efforts and ability to make a living. It protects an artists time spent creating and it protects an artists style so an artist can make a living. Your office has protected artists for 200 years.<br/><br/>GAI destroys every single one of those protections, and violates the very purpose of your office. GAI only functions if it is fed our copyrighted material. GAI should only be allowed to feed their GAI models material they have been given consent to feed and/or their own copyrighted material such as home videos, there own photographs, their own voice, their own paintings, their own poetry and journals.  Instead they are training their models on our high quality stolen art. These companies are making billions from tech that is completely dependent on our copyrighted material. If they are allowed to do this, they will eradicate our the artist as we know it. Soon there will be no need for your office if protections are not put in place.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I believe an actor should be able to copyright their likeness and voice because our art is our likeness and voice. Why can a piece of music be registered, but my likeness and voice can be stolen even though I have been making money off of my likeness and voice since 1994? If anyone can scan an actors voice and likeness and feed it to GAI and profit off of it without consent, then something is wrong with the laws that govern copyright and with humanity.<br/><br/>Without your defense, there will most likely be very little artistic development coming from the United States of America in the future. <br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Catherine Black
