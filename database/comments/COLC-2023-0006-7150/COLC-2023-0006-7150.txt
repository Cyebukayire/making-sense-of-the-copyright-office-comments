I think a fair, common-sense rule would be that, if something were trained on only public domain data then it can be copyrighted. If it is trained on data that someone has a prior claim to, like artists and authors, then any copyright still belongs to those creators, and they should have a cheap and effective way to take powerful companies to court over it. <br/><br/>Since companies like Adobe have proven themselves willing to &ldquo;scrape&rdquo; (i.e. steal) such data for their own gain and not pay the original artists (despite saying that they were not doing that), I don&rsquo;t think they can be trusted to comply with regulations about AI. So the rule needs to protect creators ahead of technology companies, and be easy to enforce and written in clear language. <br/><br/>I know coders and engineers, and most of them don&rsquo;t like what their work is going to be used to do any more than the artists. The owners of tech companies have the money and industry power to do things ethically, despite their complaints. Let&rsquo;s make them do what&rsquo;s right.
