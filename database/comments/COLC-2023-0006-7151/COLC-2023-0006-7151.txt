I believe AI to be a useful tool for creators, but we have to remember that it is a tool and not a replacement for work. If an author is prompting AI to expand on an idea or aspect of story, and then is editing the output to match their vision, the final result is work the Author should be able to copyright. Just as they would  be able to copyright work entirely created by themselves without the use of the AI tool. <br/><br/>I believe AI generated imagery is a little more complicated as there should be more involved than just asking for a particular image and expecting to be able to claim the image as is. However, images created from many AI generated elements (or just featuring some AI elements), and put together by an artist, should be copyrightable, as the end result will consist of an artist&#39;s individual ideas and style. <br/>Though I do believe there may be room for an exception to my above point. IF an artist is able to have their own dedicated individual AI model, which they have trained themselves to assist in their own work, and no one else has access, then there should be room for that artist to copyright whatever it generates. So much goes into programming and training, I think it would be hard to tell someone justly that the AI output is not a result of their own effort, work and style. I am not sure how often this would be a situation the Copyright Office would have to make allowances for, but with as much access as we all have now to coding knowledge and classes, the situation will come up.<br/><br/>In short, AI is a tool and work created by an artist or author with any tool is their own work IF they have utilized their own creativity (ideas) and skills in the creation of that work.
