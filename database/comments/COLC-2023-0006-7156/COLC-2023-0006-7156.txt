I find the use of AI to use artwork and art media to be completely unethical.  I see it as a form of theft that is used to skate around the artist while also lessening the skill and hardwork of individuals without crediting them or giving them their dues. I see this AI teft of images/art to threaten the whole purpose of art by using these tools to achieve shallow level quick results to the creators and audience, that if not governed or maintained could lead to the further malpractice of artists and creators in our day and age. I wish to see to it that this doesn&#39;t come to pass and that the human spirit, passion, dedication, and creation of pieces from within and the soul are what survive at the end of the day. I hope when this era is over we&#39;ll remember what humans made and not a false one.
