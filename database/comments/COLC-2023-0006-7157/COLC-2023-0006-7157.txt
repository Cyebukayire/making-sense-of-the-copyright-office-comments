The AI databases were obtained without the permission, compensation, or credit to the original artists. As such, anything within the database is stolen work, which is in itself already a breach of copyright law. Anything that comes of it is the direct result of said theft and should not be permitted to be copyrighted in its own right. The work from AI is not original nor created by an individual, but rather by someone with time to burn on mashing up the skills of others through a computer program they did not create.
