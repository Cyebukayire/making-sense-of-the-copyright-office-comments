Artificial Intelligence has great potential for helping humans, but commercializing it also comes with many pitfalls. The biggest problem is that most generative AI programs, such as ChatGPT, were trained on large datasets culled or scraped from the internet without curation or filtering. They can thus make use of copyrighted works in ways that go beyond fair use&mdash;because the programmers themselves can&#39;t really guess what they&#39;ll spit out. <br/><br/>I&#39;m calling on regulatory agencies to take strong steps with respect to AI output, in order to protect authors, writers, musicians, artists and any other creatives who earn money by generating new things. We offer copyright protection so that creative workers can be fairly compensated for use of their works in ways that THEY determine to sell. Thus, if the owners of an AI cannot prove it was trained ONLY on public domain works, then at minimum, the output must be assumed to contain copyrighted work and should not be usable for any commercial purposes. Because the influence of a particular work can&#39;t be separated out from the rest of the AI training, NO output from the AI is commercially viable; no fair use can be determined. Furthermore, in any compensation scheme, unless the owners of an AI can prove a work was excluded from training, if it can be found on the internet then it must be deemed included and the creator can join the compensation.
