I am a voice actor and a member of the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. I am currently on strike over this issue of AI, and as a working voice actor for over 30 years and I believe there needs to be strong regulations on generative AI. I am a person, an artist, and a huge fan of art that other people have made. <br/><br/>For years, we have been told not to make copies of movies or music or art for our own enrichment. We certainly cannot SELL the copies of movies or music or art. To encourage generative AI without strong protections is tantamount to sampling our work as artists for the ongoing greed of those who prioritize profit over people. Unregulated generative AI software should more rightly be called exactly what it is - plagiarism software. Plagiarism has never been allowed - especially for the financial benefit of the plagiarizer. So why would it suddenly be okay now? <br/><br/>Yesterday I became aware of a site on Discord called AI Hub, that is cloning my voice for their purposes without my permission. Sadly it is not just me on the site! I am one of many of my fellow voice actors who&rsquo;s training, uniqueness, voices, are being stolen without permission!<br/><br/>If we allow this plagiarism of work that voice actors, writers, musicians, and artists have truly worked for on a human level - if we allow their creativity to be swept into a &#39;dataset&#39; for future generations, to be used to train software to replace us, we are abdicating our responsibilities as humans, and as artists. We are choosing algorithmic answers over the deep work of wrestling with the world we have today. That is not simply taking a shorter route - that is cheating! AND at the expense of the artist!<br/> <br/>For generative AI companies to use our work in an unregulated manner to feed their AI models to one day spit out &quot;art&quot; is taking the deeply human drive to create and imagine - and handing it over to machines + machine learning. It is allowing generative AI companies to profit from our work without guardrails, and destroy our future. It devalues the life&#39;s work of thousands upon thousands of artists.<br/><br/>How do we protect our life&rsquo;s work? How do we value and ensure the safety of our experiences, training, uniquely human essence, without laws in place? Companies don&rsquo;t mention AI but they include in their contracts with voice artists language such as; &lsquo;we own your voice, in perpetuity, throughout the universe, without any limitation, on any platform known or unknown, now in existence, or hereafter discovered or conceived.&rsquo;  How can any other person, company, institution or technology have more rights to our own voice then the person who actually spoke the words?! Where is the human protection?!  <br/><br/>There are incredible benefits and possibilities with AI, both generative and predictive - but much like fire, it can keep us safe, warm, fed - or it can burn everything down.  Deep care and regulation feel absolutely essential here.<br/>
