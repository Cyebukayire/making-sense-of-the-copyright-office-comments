AI is a danger to good paying, American jobs, especially in the Entertainment Industry, which contributes billions to America&#39;s GDP every year. Writers, production workers, photographers and animators are just a few jobs that would be clobbered by AI. AI also does not generate any independent content. It steals from human creators and presents an amalgamation of traditionally copywrited work as &quot;original.&quot; It&#39;s simply illegal, plain and simple. There&#39;s no control mechanism for analyzing whether AI generated content is generating revenue, one of the major factors weighed when considering infringement.<br/><br/>Any consideration of the use of AI needs to contemplate meaningful Universal Basic Income to support American&#39;s put out of work. You can even ask ChatGPT and it will generate answers about AI&#39;s potential catastrophic impact on jobs and recommends job retraining and Universal Basic Income as necessary policies.<br/><br/>We MUST AGGRESSIVELY REGULATE AI and implement policies NOW that will support those workers who will lose their jobs.
