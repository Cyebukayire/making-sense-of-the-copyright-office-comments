My name is Miles, U.S. Citizen and concerned about A.I. I will not lie and say that i am an expert on the subject but i do know for a fact that in August of this year, a Federal Court in Washington D.C. set the precedent that Human authorship is &quot;a bedrock requirement for copyright&quot; based on &quot;Centuries of settled understanding&quot;, [https://www.reuters.com/legal/ai-generated-art-cannot-receive-copyrights-us-court-says-2023-08-21/] and I personally believe that is a strong policy. <br/><br/>A possible concern i would also like to bring up is that if a piece of media featuring ai generation (such as voice mixing, generated imagery, etc.) were to feature the likeness or voice of a copyrighted character, would that be a case of copyright infringement? would the copyright owner of the character have automatic ownership of ai media that featured their character due to that likeness having to had come from some of their own property? Just a few minutes ago I saw an image generated by the bing image creator of Kermit the Frog falling off the stairs and getting his throat slit bloodily by American Icon Uncle Sam, and i wonder how in the world the copyright office would go about categorizing something such as that. <br/><br/>Another concern is the idea of AI as theft, plagiarism, and impersonation. The training data that AI tools run on have to had come from somewhere and I wonder if it could be argued that if an individual could prove within little of a doubt that an AI piece was built off of their own personal copyrighted property, that they would be able to sue on the grounds of plagiarism or theft in cases where the image is directly used such as a case shared in a tiktok [https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8j5dkG1/] where an artist was scammed by having a work in progress piece stolen by their client and then &#39;&#39;finished&#39;&#39; by an AI, or impersonation in the cases of ai voice mixing that is prompted to say things that the person referenced for the voice would not say, AI image generation whose prompt reads to the extent of &quot;subject x in the style of artist y&quot;. Furthermore, does an individual have a right under their state privacy laws to object to the use of their likeness and identity in ai sampling and output? i believe that they should, but ultimately that&#39;s your job to decide.<br/><br/>One more potential scenario I imagined in the process of writing this short comment is wondering what fraction of a shared copyright ownership would a individual or group need to have in order to freely create their own ai generated media with their copyright owned characters, and would they even be able to copyright such an output in the precedent set by the federal court mentioned in the first passage were upheld nationwide? And if say, a social media company used a pert of their terms of service that stated they have the right to transform data uploaded to their site, in order for them to be embedded in all sizes of presentation, be able to freely use a user&#39;s text, images, or voice, as parts of data sets, or would that only apply to it being used by the social media site itself and the individuals and/or groups would have a right to demand that their user-made content be opted out of a data set owned by the parent company? Would an individual be able to argue that in the case of ai generative systems that sample the entire internet, that by using their copyrighted work uploaded anywhere on the web as training data for an ai, that the ai&#39;s parent company is committing copyright infringement by using the individual&#39;s work without permission or payment?<br/><br/>I apologize if I at point went off-topic from copyright and copyright policy, i just, like many others my age, have very strong opinions on the sort of free reign that AI currently has on the world wide web within the current legal landscape.
