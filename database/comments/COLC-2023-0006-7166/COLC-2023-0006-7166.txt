Participation in AI &quot;learning&quot; should always be &quot;opt-in&quot; - meaning, AI cannot be trained on a copyright holder/creator&#39;s materials unless permission is explicitly given.<br/><br/>That permission will define any kind of compensation, if there is any.<br/><br/>For works generated using AI, different &quot;learning models&quot; may have different copyright permissions, based off the material of which of model is trained on. Meaning, one model may have permission from the creators it learned from to issue copyrights of material generated off their work. Another model may not have that permission from the creators who contributed their work, thus generated works cannot be copywritten. Records must be kept of creators and their permissions, made publicly available by the company who owns the AI models.<br/><br/>For models that do issue copyrights, again, compensation will be defined during a creators &quot;opt-in&quot;. Whether this is a share of royalties or a flat rate for access to their portfolio (which could be a yearly compensation, single-payment, etc.) is up to the AI model&#39;s company and what they decide to offer creators.<br/><br/>Copyright should be filed with the AI model&#39;s company as the Author, while Ownership can be given to the individual who generates a work based off a prompt. This will allow both the Copyright Office and the Public to trace the AI engine which generated the work and validate the permissions that govern how the work was generated.<br/><br/>A copyright for an AI generated work can not be filed by the individual user/prompt giver. It must be filed by the AI model&#39;s company to again validate that the work was generated with a model that allows for copyrighted material. This could be an additional service the AI model&#39;s company charges for, but all requests must be processed through the AI model&#39;s parent company and not an individual prompt-giver.<br/><br/>Just my two+ cents :)<br/><br/>
