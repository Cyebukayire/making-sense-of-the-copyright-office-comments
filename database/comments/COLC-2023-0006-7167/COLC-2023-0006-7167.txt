Hello,<br/><br/>I am writing to voice my support for having no copyright protections for any AI generated images, text, video, voice or other medium. I think copyright in general already goes too far and has been subsumed by corporations to stifle creativity and results in cultural stagnation. Introducing &quot;AI&quot; doesn&#39;t help anyone and would most likely end up hurting as existing artists will be tossed aside by profit focused companies. Not allowing AI to be copyrighted would be a decisive stand against future exploitative practices. There is no fully preventing AI tools use, but regulations around how they must be explicitly marked as AI generated and not copyrighted are a good start.
