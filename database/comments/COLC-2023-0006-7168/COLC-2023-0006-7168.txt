AI can be a remarkable tool. However, it has been used inconsiderately by the people training them. The onus should not be on creators to &quot;opt out&quot; only after they have discovered their work has been used without their permission, but for AI to only be trained using content that belongs to the AI creator, with explicit consent of all owners of said content in the case of studio assets. The same way photographers need permission from their models, AI training should be done only with works who&#39;s creators or estates have released specific permission to a specific AI project.
