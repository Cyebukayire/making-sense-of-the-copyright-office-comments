To Whom It May Concern,<br/><br/>I am a screenwriter in Los Angeles, and I have grave concerns about the use of AI, not simply as a threat to my livelihood, but as an appreciator of art myself. I can understand the use of AI in, for example, law, or even medicine, the ability to synthesize an entire universe of data in mili-seconds in order to help inform a decision. But as it relates to copyrighted work: what is gained by allowing these databases to simply store, crawl, and regurgitate the works of others? To what end? In what way does it benefit writers, or readers, or American society at large to have an endless churn of plagiarized material? The entire purpose of art is to commune with our fellow human beings, to tap into something that we share, to recognize ourselves in others. A computer simply cannot achieve this: it has no human experience to share, it has no way to relate. (Not to mention the fact that the source material these systems are scouring to create their plagiarisms actually do belong to certain copyright holders and therefore this is not only illegal, but a threat to our beloved capitalist system.) <br/><br/>We need to ban these systems from being able to simply regurgitate what human beings have spent their lives creating, for no other reason than to create wealth for a handful of tech entrepreneurs who don&#39;t value the source material in the first place. We need strict regulation of a technology that even its creators have admitted they don&#39;t fully understand.<br/><br/>Shut it down, and barring that, make it hard.
