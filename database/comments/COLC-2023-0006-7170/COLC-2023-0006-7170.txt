There are potentially a variety of useful applications of learned language model text and model-generated artwork, however current models have been built on unethically sourced content, in clear violation of the copyrights held by the original creators of the works. Until models are ethically built, and there is a way to protect works of art and other text based forms of information with the included required disclosure when used (for example, articles must say &quot;llms have been used to generate part or all of this text&quot;), and the acknowledgement made that these model-generated creations are not art, cannot be copyrighted as art, and have no place being treated as a replacement for art (but rather as a supplement), there&#39;s no way llms and art generators can be allowed to grow.
