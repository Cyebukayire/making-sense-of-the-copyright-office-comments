If AI generated content is using pre-existing pieces of media as a basis, one should not be able to copyright it. I believe that a person using AI should not be able to profit off of the blood, sweat, and tears of someone else&#39;s hard work and refinement of their craft. If they wish to make a profit, they should do it themselves, with their own works.
