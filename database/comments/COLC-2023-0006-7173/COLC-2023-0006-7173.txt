As I writer and someone whose work is protected by copyright, I want to express my opinion against the use of AI to be able to mine the creative work of artists for its own purposes.  Copyright should protect not just against human encroachment on intellectual property, but that of AI as well.  There have already been cases where AI has co-opted the work of writers, to the detriment of those writers.  Copyright law should protect our country&#39;s artists and writers from being taken advantage of, and that includes by AI and by corporations that use it.
