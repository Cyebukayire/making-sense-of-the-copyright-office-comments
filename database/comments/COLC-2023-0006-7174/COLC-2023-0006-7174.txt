&quot;Generative AI&quot; technology is theft. These creators have not received an opportunity to consent when their creations are used to train generative technology and they are not receiving individual credit. I believe that these technologies need to both 1) obtain consent to use each individual piece included in their training and 2) credit every single creator for each piece that is being outputted. If 10,000 authors consented to be used to train the technology that produces a novel, then all 10,000 need to be credited when that novel is shared. <br/><br/>Right now this technology is being used for terrible things - voices are being stolen and made to say things that their owner would never say (identity theft?) and images are being taken and used in revenge porn (something worse than slander, honestly) and these actions need to have serious consequences. Individuals should have a right to their own voice and image, now more than ever. <br/><br/>Let technology support humanity, not the other way around.
