Response to General Question #1 views on potential benefits &amp; risks of generative AI technology:<br/>Generative AI has the potential to benefit individuals lacking traditional compositional skills across media. For example, anyone may conceptualize a painting in their mind but not everyone has the ability to accurately manifest that image. Unfortunately, AI&rsquo;s potential benefit is not without its potential harm.<br/>While the example given demonstrates a potential expansion of human creators, honing their ability to use AI tools rather than traditional artistic skills, it comes with a cost. The artist who would have otherwise been commissioned to create that piece has been eliminated.<br/>One of the primary purposes of copyright is to fiscally protect creators so that they may continue to produce works which enrich our culture and our lives. Generative AI runs the risk of undercutting traditional creators who already struggle to be fairly compensated for their work (ex. the recent WGA and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strikes).<br/>We cannot overlook the likelihood of bad-faith actors outcompeting traditional artists or oversaturating the market through cheap, mass-produced AI-generated content. While some may argue that is the free-market, it overlooks a key difference between generative AI and humans: Generative AI cannot critically analyze the information it has been trained on. It can only reinforce biases already present in the dataset; an iterative echo-chamber of pattern recognition.<br/>I believe generative AI can be a positive tool, but as this technology emerges and grows, we must be conscientious of doing so in an ethical manor. Are AI training datasets given willingly? An open submission runs the risk of individuals feeding it pirated material. What about privacy for chatbots or an individual&rsquo;s right to their own likeness, be it visual or audio? Honing a creative skillset takes time, effort, and money, which already poses a barrier for marginalized voices. Allowing unfettered use of AI in commercial endeavors provides fiscal motivation to prioritize AI-generated content over human-generated content. The act of creation and the appreciation thereof are deeply human experiences. America may be a capitalist society, but our humanity needs to come before profit.<br/><br/>Response to Training Questions #9 &amp; 9.1 copyright owners&rsquo; consent wrt training materials<br/>It is my opinion that copyright owners should maintain the right to deny the use of their works for training materials for generative AIs. To this extent, I believe it is best implemented via an affirmative consent (opt in) model as it provides stronger protections to copyright holders. Given the divisive nature of AI technology, I believe that this should extend to all models, not just commercial uses, provided the copyright holder is the original creator of the work or is acting in accordance with said creator&rsquo;s wishes.
