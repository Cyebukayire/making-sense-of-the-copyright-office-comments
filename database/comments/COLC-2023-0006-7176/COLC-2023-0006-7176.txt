Banning AI systems from being trained on public data would be incredibly devastating for ai progress. Public data is crucial for training effective AI models. If researchers and practitioners were barred from using it to train ml models, innovation in the field would grind to a halt. Both research and practical applications rely heavily on the ability to leverage large public datasets. These datasets allow AI systems to learn generalizable knowledge. Innovation would also be severely weakened if researchers and practitioners were not allowed to train AI models on public data. Access to public data enables discoveries and advances that benefit society as a whole
