Generative AI as it currently exists is built on large-scale theft and produces an output that contains no original human ideas. <br/><br/>When these generative AIs were created, they were trained on huge stores of text, audio, and/or images, which in the vast majority of cases the AI developers did not have the rights to use and did not ask the copyright holder for permission to use their work to create a profit-driving new technology. This is large-scale theft. <br/><br/>When something is generated by one of these AIs, all of the ideas the AI is using come from the stolen works. Nothing new is created by the people who developed the AI, or who use it- it is merely a remix of what was stolen. <br/><br/>For these reasons I think that AI output should not be copyrightable. I furthermore believe that the holders of the copyright for the stolen items used to train the generative AI have a valid case for claiming copyright infringement.
