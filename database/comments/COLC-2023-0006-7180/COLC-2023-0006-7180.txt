Generative AI is based on the idea of stealing other peoples works and regurgitating them into uninteresting dribble. It lacks the qualities humans possess where we iterate, adding our own unique take on how we perceive things to create something new. It possesses no real use outside being a detriment to creative industries and being a grift for conmen to steal and take advantage of others. I think even in cases where a generative ai has a private date base based on say a company&#39;s employees work, that work will be lesser and prone to issues in a variety of ways built into the very foundation of AI such as its tendency to hallucinate or falling apart when it uses information generated by itself as a resource. <br/><br/>I implore you to not allow it to get out of hand and give conmen more rope to use it for their schemes. <br/><br/>Thank You
