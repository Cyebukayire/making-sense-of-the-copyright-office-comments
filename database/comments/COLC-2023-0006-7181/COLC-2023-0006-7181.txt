To whom it may concern at the US Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m an author who uses AI technology as a writing assistant. While it&rsquo;s true that the use of AI raises some complex issues with regard to copyright, I firmly believe that my creative work produced with the aid of AI most certainly deserves copyright protection.<br/><br/>I use AI tools because they help me work more efficiently while saving time, and due to my incessant guidance and intervention, the stories I publish are unequivocally my own. I provide the AI with a detailed narrative outline that maps the plot, subplots, characters, setting details, major and minor story beats. At every step of the writing process, I continually ensure the AI output aligns with my creative vision. This is done by making substantive revisions to shape the story according to my artistic goals.<br/><br/>The AI is not allowed to deviate from the prompts I provide, nor do I allow it to introduce any new creative elements not contained in my instructions. It serves solely as a means to translate my detailed creative directions into coherent literary text that faithfully reflects my original expression. The final published work bears my unique voice and perspective, which does not reflect or embody any independent creative choices made by the AI system itself. I&rsquo;m the human in charge of what&rsquo;s being created.<br/><br/>As the Supreme Court has already recognized, utilizing tools that assist in production does not negate human authorship. Similar to how a camera does not author a photograph, my AI assistant does not author my stories. I maintain complete creative control throughout the writing process, and it is my human intellect alone that determines every artistic choice that defines the work.<br/><br/>The process through which AI can be used to assist an author&rsquo;s creation is a matter of the human&rsquo;s ideas, articulation, direction, intervention and refinement being present from start to finish. This is the reason why many authors deserve the security and protection of registered copyright despite having used an AI tool in the process of creation. I have no doubt that I&rsquo;m just one of many authors who uses AI responsibly in this way.<br/><br/>I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of my comments and experience as an author. I look forward to your conclusions.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>A concerned author and storyteller.<br/>
