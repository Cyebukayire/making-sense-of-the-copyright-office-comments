Artificial Intelligence artwork needs to be regulated. There&#39;s been a huge amount of data scraped (without the creator&#39;s consent) in order for these generators to work. My domain got scraped at some point and I found a couple drawings were input into a dataset without my say-so. There was no permission granted to use my art to train their models. I also don&#39;t even make a living off my art. I don&#39;t make enough as it is and sites like MidJourney are banking it because people rather pay a subscription than actually learn how to create. It&#39;s also scary and really odd to be watching people fiddle with dead vocalists voices (Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and so forth). It&#39;s really disheartening. I&#39;m also finding ads on social media walls with obvious use of AI art.  This basically means a graphic designer didn&#39;t get a job because a business decided to use a generator that feeds off of our work (again, feeding off work they had no permission to use for training).  Please, regulate this AI stuff where these people who put together datasets for their AI programs need to obtain permission before using our works.
