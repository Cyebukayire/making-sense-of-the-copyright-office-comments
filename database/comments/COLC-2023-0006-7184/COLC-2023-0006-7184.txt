Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment. I don&#39;t believe that AI should be allowed to train on copyrighted works without consent from the creators, and I believe the creators should then be compensated for the use of their material. I don&#39;t believe that AI should be allowed to train on any material without the creator&#39;s consent, whether copyrighted or posted on a public platform, but I don&#39;t know if the Copyright Office can do anything to regulate AI&#39;s use of non-copyrighted works for training. I do know that authors are allowed exclusive rights in their creative works for a set period of time, and using these works to train AI without the author&#39;s consent violates those exclusive rights. Additionally, I believe works created from AI should not be eligible for copyright without significant further human manipulation/improvement on the generated content. I&#39;ve seen someone else share their opinion saying, &quot;While I think there are potentially useful applications of learned language model text and model-generated artwork, I think the current models built on unethically sourced content, in clear violation of the copyrights held by the original creators of the works, is the &quot;poison pill&quot; that destroys any utility these models might have had. Until models are ethically built, and the use of them a required disclosure (for example, articles must say &quot;llms have been used to generate part or all of this text&quot;), and the acknowledgement made that these model-generated creations are not art, cannot be copyrighted as art, and have no place being treated as a replacement for art (but rather as a supplement), there&#39;s no way llms and art generators can be allowed to grow. It&#39;s my opinion that the current existing models need to be destroyed, and replaced by models built using ethically sourced datasets.&quot; This is a very eloquently phrased reflection of my own beliefs. In conclusion, I believe the Copyright Office should adopt positions finding AI trained on copyrighted works without the consent of the creators as copyright infringement and unethical, as well as finding that AI-created works that have not been significantly edited by humans cannot be copyrighted. Thank you again for your time and consideration on this important matter.
