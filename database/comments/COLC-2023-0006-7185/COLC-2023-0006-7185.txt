The intention of copyright protection is to protect the rights of creators who have spent time and effort in creating original content, whatever the medium.<br/><br/>An AI application such as ChatGPT does not create. It selects words randomly, following an algorithm to copy the works of other creators that have, legitimately or not, been selected to refine that algorithm. The words do not represent ideas, as they would from a human creator. Instead they are guesses as to what the person using the application wants to see written. Guesses informed by millions upon millions of words of human creators&#39; works that have been entered with or without their consent.<br/><br/>I write as a hobby rather than as a vocation. Over a quarter million words I&#39;ve written are available on the internet at various sites. I would like to know if any AI application has used my writing as part of a mass &quot;machine learning&quot; exercise. I should be able to opt-out of any such exercise. I&#39;m quite happy with people reading my words for free. I object to bad actors using my work to refine their algorithm for profit.<br/><br/>Nothing that an AI application produces should be copyrightable. If a work consists partially of AI material and part by a human creator, then only those sections created by the human should be copyrightable.<br/><br/>If AI works could be copyrighted, then some enterprising soul will at some point attempt to replicate the &quot;million monkeys on a million typewriters&quot; though experiment, except using AI models to at least produce works consisting of actual words and readable sentences. Given the time and power and computer power and storage space, someone could theoretically create and copyright every sentence that will ever be written.
