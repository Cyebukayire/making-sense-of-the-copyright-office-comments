AI should be a tool, not a replacement. It should not steal work from the people but help them do better work. Anyone who uses other people&#39;s work to train AI especially without permission, must compensate the original creator, period. It isn&#39;t fair that AI is being used to take the human element away from art when people have strived to create it for centuries. People who automated jobs or use AI to replace people should be taxed. Many people have lost their jobs and livelihoods because of automation. The people are suffering an economic crisis that a mere 9 to 5 job can&#39;t pay for. Please consider acting for the benefit of the people in need and not for the profit for the people well off.
