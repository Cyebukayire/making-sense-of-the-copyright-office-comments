I think, ultimately, that it is difficult for me to grasp how it would be ethical for somebody to claim copyright on something they 1) did not create themselves, and 2) only managed through a significant reliance on the work of others (including those with copyrights!) who did not necessarily consent to such use. If I write fanfiction, it is not something I can profit off of or claim uniquely as my own; I struggle to understand, then, how somebody can take the effort and labor of innumerable other writers and their works and then turn around and act like it belongs to them. I think there is something to say about the level of human effort involves. It is one thing to use AI to brainstorm solutions to writing one&#39;s self in a corner or to create a visual to use as reference for drawing a picture, but relying on the conglomerate efforts of others to create something that really requires limited effort and/or skill just does not seem like it should be provided copyright.
