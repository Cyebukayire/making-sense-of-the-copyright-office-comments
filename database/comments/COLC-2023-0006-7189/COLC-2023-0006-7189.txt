AI generated work cannot be copyright protected as it is generated by a machine program, with practically no human input aside from the initial &ldquo;prompts.&rdquo;  Using AI generated artwork/voices/etc should be considered copyright infringement, especially if used commercially. The reason for this is the programs &ldquo;learn&rdquo; from the work of artists, photographers, writers, voice actors, and other individuals with no given permission or financial compensation whatsoever.
