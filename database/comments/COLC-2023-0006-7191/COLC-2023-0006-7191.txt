This comment is in regard and defense to all creative-use AI, from an artist and programmer, directed at the issues that may arise long-term from poorly thought-out legislation.<br/><br/>Right now, there are many emotionally charged groups who are pushing an apocryphal &quot;human-centric&quot; narrative to AI-generated content. This perspective often treats AI creations as entirely devoid of human involvement. It&#39;s important to remember that AI is not an independent creator; it is a tool used by humans to express their creativity. Therefore, any limitations placed on AI can directly restrict the creative freedom of human artists, rather than controlling some independent &quot;AI&quot; entity. Human artists are being restricted in a new medium.<br/><br/>As an artist, we learn all we know from others. We are allowed to draw copyrighted characters as long as they aren&#39;t being passed off as our own or selling them. So, why can&#39;t I generate them then? This can be applied to video as well, if what I have created would have no legal issues as an artist, why am I restricted if AI is involved? If the same video was created, one with AI and the other without, what is the difference? Everything I learned was learned from others.<br/><br/>The core of this discussion is that while it might be tempting to cater to current emotionally charged sentiments, such an approach may not prove sustainable in the long term. As AI technology continues to advance and become more commonplace, AI-generated content will likely become an integral part of creative expression. Overly restrictive regulations on this medium, beyond what is currently applied to &quot;human-made&quot; art, could necessitate future adjustments to copyright laws. Such revisions might, in hindsight, appear as an unnecessary waste of time and resources. Digital art as a whole (using graphic tablets to draw with a stylus) was treated with similar distain. It was &quot;too easy&quot;. Now such remarks are, of course, gone.  <br/><br/>AI regulations should primarily focus on preventing situations where individuals may unwittingly find themselves in unfair agreements. For instance, it is crucial to ensure that actors are not inadvertently permitting the use of their likeness by directors for purposes they did not consent to. In cases where consent is granted, it is imperative that fair compensation is provided. The existence of copyrighted material in training data is irrelevant, humans have copyrighted training data in our own brains. What is produced is what matters.<br/><br/>I will repeat: It is important to underscore that AI-generated works should not be treated differently from &quot;human works&quot;. in almost every instance, they fundamentally originate from human creativity and input.
