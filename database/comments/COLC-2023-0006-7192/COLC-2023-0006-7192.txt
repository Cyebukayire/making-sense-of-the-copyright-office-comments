At this current time, AI has very little to no regulations in the United States as well as all across the world. These programs negatively impact artists work by indirectly plagiarizing their creations as well as affecting a portion of the job market and ultimately their income. AI needs strict regulations to protect not just digital and traditional artists, but musicians, designers, actors, etc. Because of the power of this tool, being used for the wrong or even misguided intentions can have devastating consequences. The internet has shaped our society in ways we couldn&rsquo;t have predicted and needs stronger regulations overall. I believe AI can and needs to be a place to begin really showcasing our ability to reduce harm and prioritize the importance of creative careers in the United States.
