Ai is &quot;trained&quot; using work that belongs to another, work that almost always falls under some sort of copyright. If the work used to &quot;train&quot; A I models falls into the category of fair use, such as the use of works with expired copyright, the work created is still derivative rather than unique. Without significant human editing to AI products, the work itself is simply smashing together other works. That&#39;s not unique or copyrightable. <br/><br/>Unless the creation of work can be guaranteed not to infringe upon the copyright or the reserved rights of other content creators, the AI work itself cannot be copyrighted. We see similar cases with &#39;sampling&#39; in music production.
