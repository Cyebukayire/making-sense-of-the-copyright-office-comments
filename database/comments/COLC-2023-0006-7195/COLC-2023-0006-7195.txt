AI is a dangerous, unregulated mechanism which threatens the privacy and liberties of individuals, artists, the working class, you name it. The plagiarism already being committed by AI and the corporations that use it is disgusting. The livelihood of millions is threatened as more and more corporations integrate AI into their daily processes, and the only ones with gain are the Uber-rich. The average worker or person does not gain from being &quot;replaced&quot; by AI, since they are not being provided with base income, or compensated beyond their productivity at work. Continued use of AI will lead to unemployment, increased poverty, as well as an undercurrent of fear of having your individual thoughts and ideas stolen from you by sneaky corporations under the guide of &quot;data collection&quot;. AI Must be regulated and individuals Must be protected. Billionaires and corporations must not be allowed to let this get out of control for the sake of their own financial gains. Additionally the ethics of AI and it&#39;s uses must be considered as well! Based on reports from developers, these AI programs begin to believe they have sentience. The risk is too great.
