I am an individual that regularly consumes multiple forms of media, I believe that by allowing AI (Such as ChatGPT, DallE, ETC) to create copyrightable works will negatively affect the creative environment and will hurt far more creators than it will help, by allowing this we will end up making fewer pieces of art, much of it being based off of someone else&#39;s copyrighted work. This is an exceedingly important fact, that if AI is able to be copyrighted then fewer people will do art with the increased risk of someone stealing, or having an AI recreate what they make.
