How should AI models use copyrighted data in training?<br/>If AI models need to use copyrighted material for training then they should get permission/consent from the copyright owners. Otherwise, copyrighting your work would essentially mean nothing because your work would not be protected. Copyrighted works are someone&#39;s livelihood, their voice, and their style. Allowing AI to steal their work in order to enable anyone to create something in that person&#39;s style is unfair. It essentially deprives individuals of the opportunity to make a living from the skills they have dedicated years to developing and the work they have created in their voice/style. <br/><br/>Should AI-generated material be copyrighted (even without human involvement)?<br/>It&#39;s a bit ironic AI can steal copyrighted material but then we&#39;re asking if AI generated material can be copyrighted and therefore protected. AI-generated material should not be copyrighted with or without human involvement. It should definitely not be copyrighted without human involvement. AI was supposed to be a tool to democratize image making and writing, and if you copyright it, then none of it would be free or accessible to everyone. AI material should also not be copyrighted even if a human was prompting it. The AI is creating the image, therefore there is very little human involvement and creativity. To copyright a piece of work I think a human should have manipulated the work at least by 80% for it to be copyrighted.<br/>
