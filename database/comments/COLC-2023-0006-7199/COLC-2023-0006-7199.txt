I am writing to you as an artist and a gallerist on the subject of generative AI. As an artist and a supporter of artists and the arts, I think it is essential for the government to step in and take measures to protect the copyrights of creative people everywhere. Creativity IS humanity and the process by which AI can scrub the internet to then steal an individual&#39;s creative output for the purpose of re-creation without credit or financial payment or licensing goes against all copyright laws.
