Under current copyright law, I believe that works created with AI are copyrightable. The product created by AI typically does not strongly resemble any specific works that have been used to train the model and is transformative enough to have its own copyright. However, I believe that this means that there should be a reframing of how copyright laws are applied to AI, which may mean new or changed legislation. This is important in order to protect human artists and encourage people to continue making art, as well as to prevent those whose art is used to train AI from being exploited by what may someday by their rival.
