NEW FEDERAL LEGISLATION LEADING TO LAW TO ADDRESS PHOTO IMAGE EDITING PROBLEM USING ML, ON DEVICE TPU, GEN AI<br/><br/>New law(s) as part of existing Title 17, Federal Law, AI Consumer Protection Law(s) as sub-parts. <br/><br/>Requiring US incorporated smartphone manufacturers, Google, Apple, to include specific metadata capability in factory shipped smartphones image modding apps.<br/>(If not specific metadata, then file data features supporting ability for US Copyright Office, consumers and US law officials to easily determine):<br/>1) Has image been edited?<br/>2) Is image a by-product of facial editing, facial photo replacement?<br/>3) Is image a by-product of filtering?<br/>4) Has image data been altered? If so, when and what?<br/>3) Has image data been moved in image, image data moved between images, replaced, resized in image?<br/><br/>SMARTPHONE FEATURE BEING ADDRESSED<br/>For example, Google, Pixel 8 smartphone ships with photo app capable of editing multiple group photos into a combined, single photo containing the best face expressions. A group of four people gather and a person uses a smartphone to take 10 photos of the group. In each photo at least one person has a look on face that someone in the group is not happy with. Google, Pixel 8 combines the best face expressions from each photo into one final photo- where everyone looks &#39;happy.&#39; Also includes ability to move objects in photo to make photo more &lsquo;appealing&rsquo;. While appealing to individual consumers, potentially creates a number of significant problems.<br/><br/>PROBLEMS<br/>1) Photo is no longer original, pure as on the day photo was made. Photo is no longer a fully &rsquo;human-authored&rsquo; image and therefore photo is not copyrightable.<br/>2) Potentially generates problems with forensics, enabling potential fraud as court related evidence of individual&rsquo;s actual facial expressions, locations of objects in a photo and other photo evidence moved.<br/>3) Degredes historical truth about individuals or a group over decades and centuries.<br/>4) Encourages, enables, proliferation of generational Lie Culture.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SOLUTION<br/>Generate, collect small amount of metadata from original photos and put metadata in file data of &lsquo;final&rsquo; edited photo.<br/>1) Add metadata flag to the final image, image_altered_TRUE, date_time<br/>2) Add metadata flag to the final image, facial_image_altered_TRUE, date_time<br/>3) Add metadata flag to the final image, region_moved_TRUE, date_time<br/>4) Create small data array for each original photo containing 10 data points around the &lsquo;happy face&rsquo; being lifted to be placed in the final image. Array has 10 pixel locations, edge detection points about or around the &lsquo;happy face&rsquo; in original image, pixel color value, date, time, original file name. Photo 1 array, array for photo 2, array for photo 3 and other metadata elements (#1,#2,#3).<br/>5) In the final photo where the three &lsquo;happy faces&rsquo; are dropped-in, include the three data arrays inside the final photo file data. Include vector data of where the over-layed image segments were moved to.<br/>6) Put the three arrays data either in the final photo file header, end of file or where appropriate, but not a separate file.<br/>7) Ensure the final, edited photo is not viewable if flags exist and no array data present in file. To help with preserving truth about edited file.<br/>8) Have US Copyright Office use a specific, approved software application or plug-in to detect image_altered_TRUE, date_time flags in Copyright Analyst&rsquo;s determination procedures. Therefore, helping Copyright Analyst decide if image is completely &lsquo;human-authored&rsquo; or is a product of multi-image editing and or Generative AI altering.
