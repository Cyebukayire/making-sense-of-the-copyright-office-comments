I&#39;m concerned about AI programs for the generation of art and writing; by and large these seem to leverage training materials that was gathered without the original writer or artist&#39;s consent, which are then remixed into a &quot;new&quot; product, which a third party can attempt to sell for profit, potentially displacing writers and artists professionally, as they will be forced to compete with machines that can effortlessly generate many scrambled/remixed copies of their work. I believe protections are needed so that writers and artists are not displaced by this technology, and so that consumers are not flooded with artificially generated text and imagery that may have low quality (factual inaccuracies, etc). This is of particular concern because many people now get information via internet search, and common news sites and other informational sources could be flooded with low-quality AI generated content that has not been adequately fact checked.
