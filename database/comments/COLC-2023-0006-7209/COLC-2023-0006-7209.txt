I believe that works generated using AI systems should not be considered human-generated work, and therefore should not be copyrightable. One of the basics of copyright law is that a work in question is a work of authorship, meaning that it is not created by nature, or a computer but must have a human author. If the United States were to allow AI-generated material to be copyrighted then that would go against the basic principles of copyright law. The government would have to completely rewrite this law. In doing so many other copyright cases that were either dismissed or denied a copyright could come back into play. Intentionally changing this law would cause the people who submitted past cases to grow angry that they were denied rights but others were allowed to do so. It also opens up the possibility of arguments about what counts as machine-created and what counts as having enough human application. For example, Matthew Allen created a beautiful piece of artwork using AI last year and tried to get it copyrighted. He stated that &ldquo;creating the painting had required at least 624 text prompts and input revisions&rdquo;. He was denied the chance to copyright his piece because it was more machine and not enough human. This raises the question of where the limit is and how many changes must be made for a piece to be considered human-created. Thus, I think it would be better to not allow any material created using AI systems to be copyrightable. There are too many unnecessary changes that would have to be made. As well as tons of questions that the government does not seem to have answers for at this point in time. I think that the United States Government should just stick to the basics of copyright law and not allow any non-human entity, such as AI, to create copyrightable material. Only something that is human-authored should be allowed to be copyrighted. <br/>
