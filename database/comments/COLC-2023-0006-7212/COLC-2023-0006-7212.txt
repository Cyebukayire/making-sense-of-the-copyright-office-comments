LLM or future AI if we get there should be used for making automation processes easier so humans can make art. Not the other way around. This would destroy the industry around artistry and other creatively led industries. This would have unforeseen negative impacts on our country and humanity. Do not let any current &quot;AI&quot; or future AI technologies have to ability to create from data input of actual humans. If they are AI they should be able to make art without data sets.
