As someone who writes self-publishes books I find AI content very concerning. The fact that copyrighted work is being used to feed generative software is very concerning. I don&#39;t want my work being used to create other work. If a person were to do that it would be plagiarism, but if AI does it, it&#39;s okay? That is highly concerning. The idea that someone might be able to copyright something generated this way, even if it is edited, means the livelihood of authors (not to mention artists) is on the line.
