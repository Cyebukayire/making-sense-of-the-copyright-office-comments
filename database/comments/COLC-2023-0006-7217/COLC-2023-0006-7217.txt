AI in art is an affront. It is exploitation at its most clear form. It is stealing from millions of artists both as unregulated copywrite infringement as well as in the form of large companies using AI to replace artists, remove jobs from our economy, and take advantage of artists they would have previously employed simply for the sake of not wanting to give them any respect.<br/><br/>It is infinitely worse than what was happening to writers. Artists are losing money, opportunities, and in some cases, their lives because of the use of AI. While it (AI) would have been a very useful and helpful tool for the art industry, it has instead been retrofitted by greedy, cruel people to exploit vulnerable people, steal from them, and print money for nothing.
