I work full time as a novelist. It is my sole source of income. However, I recently found out that 7 (SEVEN) of my books are contained within the Books3 database that OpenAI is known to have used to populate their dataset. I have neither been compensated for this, nor did I license my book to anyone for the purpose of training AI or being a potential part of what it can output. How can we pretend to uphold IP rights and copyright law, while allowing such blatant theft?  I am not against AI. I spent several years working in the IT field and both enjoy and respect new technologies. However, something new should not be allowed to flourish and enrich its owners while running roughshod over existing laws and protections. I think AI has potential be a very valuable tool, but not until the existing datasets are destroyed and replaced with ones comprised of public domain materials and other materials for which express permission has been given for their use.  Until then, it is theft, plain and simple.
