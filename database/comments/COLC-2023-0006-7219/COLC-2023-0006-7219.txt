Ai generation has been, since the trend began, used heinously to not only steal artwork, but has also been used to create lewd images of underage people, both fictitious and real, and has been used in real-time to besmirch and replace artists professionally. Many have reported losing their jobs to corporate interest groups who then produce vastly subpar work using Ai generation trained off data that was gathered without any consent, credit or compensation. This trend needs to be quelled now. Ai generation cannot be utilized as a commercial means of artistic production. It is only as good as its data and nearly all forms of Ai generated data is effectively stolen on a mass scale from artists on the internet. This goes beyond jobs, artistic creation and ethics in content production: this is about the foundation of artistic culture. Real humans need to be utilized in the art world or else all works will prove to be 100% derivative and generated without a true sense of artistic intent. Ai generation should be a tool to help artists, not replace them with people who have never so much as picked up a paintbrush without seeing dollar signs first.
