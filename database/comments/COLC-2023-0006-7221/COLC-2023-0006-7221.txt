I have taken a machine learning (artificial intelligence) course recently as a computer science major. AI is nothing without data. Generative AI only copies patterns it finds from its training data. These patterns are invisible to humans, which is why generative AI seems so impressive to us. However, it is not transformative work. It is comprised of math equations that find commonality in a dataset. It doesn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; what it is generating. Therefore, AI should not be able to freely use copyrighted data. It is essentially copying the hidden patterns of these works. In turn, any AI generated material should not be copyrightable. AI generated material is not created by human hands, but rather complex math equations.
