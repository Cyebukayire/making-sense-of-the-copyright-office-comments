AI content should not be protected under copyright except only in the case in which the person/organization generating the content with the AI can prove the AI was solely trained on work they own or have the right to use commercially. Most AI/machine learning systems currently are trained on content from web scraping, which takes ANY work on the internet fitting the qualities the AI needs to emulate. This leads to a lot of plagiarism, especially in art and writing communities, where the authors the AI is stealing from are not credited, even if the AI recreates their work almost or entirely verbatim. AI content created in this manner, or which is unable to prove its sources, should never be protected by law.
