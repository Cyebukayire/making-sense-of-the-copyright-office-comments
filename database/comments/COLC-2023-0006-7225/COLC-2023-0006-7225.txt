The models used to generate these products have been trained by unlawfully using the copywritten work of millions of different people. Anything they prosuce is uncopywriteable.<br/><br/>This is one of the largest cases of mass copywrite infringement in history. The models should be deleted entirely and their creators need to be charged to the fullest extent possible.
