As a struggling artist, AI is of big concern for me, I have been doing this for living for 25 years, several disciplines, too. Where I live art isn&#39;t profitable, so I am forced to work for foreign companies/individuals via the Internet. And I have been paying rent and buying groceries like that, doing the only thing I know. Because I have been beating on this craft for 25 years, trying to improve with each project and learning new techniques and softwares constantly. Struggling against that stereotype: &quot;Computer graphics are just pressing a button and sitting behind a PC waiting for art to happen&quot;. Nevermind the countless hours I&#39;ve worked non-stop and the health issues I got for my troubles, people thought I was lazy. Now AI does that. With the press of a button. No skill or talent required. You literally sit behind a computer and wait for art to happen and some of these people are now my competition. Commissions that would&#39;ve paid a portion of my rent or bought that day&#39;s meal are now gone, &#39;cause someone somewhere was able to push a button. And like me, there&#39;s billions of people around the world who share totally or partially my reality. And all that, to explain to you, that these jobs, taken away from us artists, were taken way using our own work. That we uploaded to show the world we&#39;re capable, that we can do THAT THING they need us to do. Uploaded to our portfolios, our social media accounts and shared, with the hope someone will say &quot;I want that for me!&quot;. Those same works were thrown into a blender, re-mixed and sold for profit, as subscriptions or bundles. Does that sound legal to you? Does stealing a bunch of underpaid people&#39;s countless hours of work and selling it sounds OK or even ethical to you? Is this what the Copyright office stands for? Does making it mass theft makes it ok/legal?<br/><br/>I trust you will do the right thing. Thanks.
