I&#39;m a Japanese person working as a creator in Japan.<br/>In Japan, there is a lot of harassment of creators by users of image generation AI.<br/>LoRA has been distributed, and creators such as illustrators have been told that they will be cornered so that they can&#39;t make a living.<br/>Even though we are simply asking people not to use our intellectual property without permission, AI users will never stop.<br/><br/>This is due to Japanese law.<br/>In Japan, there are laws that allow limited use of copyrighted materials without permission.<br/>If you read the law, it is clear that generative AI does not fall under this law, but AI users continue to use it pretending not to understand.<br/><br/>Additionally, the Japanese government is investing heavily in the AI industry in an effort to overtake other countries in generative AI.<br/>Even though there is no technology created by Japan.<br/>The Japanese government seems determined to ignore the voices of creators for the sake of profit.<br/>It seems that the only way to change them is through foreign pressure.<br/><br/>It&#39;s so pathetic, even though it&#39;s my own country.<br/>I would like you to strongly regulate AI and put pressure on Japan as well.<br/>This is a human rights violation occurring on a global scale.<br/>For the sake of the creators who are being harmed around the world, I would like to request that AI be regulated.
