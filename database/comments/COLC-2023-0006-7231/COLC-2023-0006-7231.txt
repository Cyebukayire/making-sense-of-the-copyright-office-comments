I state, as a casual photographer, crafter, and pattern drafter, that an individual&#39;s works and creations are one of the last few things, we, as US citizens can still wholly and rightfully own without fear of being repossessed, leined, or forcibly taken thru eminent domain, police seizures, etc. Therefore it is imperative to protect the rights and copyrights of the creators, artists, photographers, and all forms of creative media above the rights of corporations and generative AI- companies, non-profits, university groups, or others. Internet companies have already come under fire for failure to protect or honor copyright in the past, and allowing generative AI carte-blanche access to our data, personal sites, and social media (which many independent artists use to advertise and promote themselves) these companies will only further their attacks on copyright and intellectual properties.<br/><br/>
