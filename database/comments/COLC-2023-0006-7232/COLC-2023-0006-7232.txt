AI is the cheap and poor man&#39;s way to use technology to regurgitate a statistically amalgamation of pre-existing and (mostly) unpaid labor. It is NOT creating art, it scrapes the internet for images to use in its database. AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; can be used ethically, it can use free source art and photography. They exist. AI such as Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney are stealing and exploiting an industry professional. It must be regulated, please. Thank you for your time.
