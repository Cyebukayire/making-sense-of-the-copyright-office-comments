As an artist I have had worse problems with humans making direct copies and derivative copies of my artwork (down to the point of even scrubbing out my copyright watermarks!). I have little concern for an AI learning model learning from my art to make things that are different from my art. Style and ideas cannot be copyrighted, it&rsquo;s the execution that matters. I can&rsquo;t stop a human from examining my art and then spring boarding off of that with their own ideas, so why should AI doing it be any different? Why should the tool matter at all? That&rsquo;s like saying a blind person doesn&rsquo;t read because they don&rsquo;t use their eyes to see letters, and instead use braille. The medium to create and transform an idea that can be shared with others shouldn&rsquo;t matter.
