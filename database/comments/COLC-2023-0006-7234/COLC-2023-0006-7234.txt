AI and Copyrightability <br/><br/>Under certain circumstances, humans should be considered the author of AI generated works. For example, in the case of creating literary works that include images, or solely images, these works could be considered copyrightable based on the level of human involvement or authorship. The author would need to take considerable steps in prompting the AI system enough to represent the author&rsquo;s intended or initial conception of the work. The author might also take substantial steps to edit the traditional images, which would only enhance the level of authorship and creative input. In other words, it would not be enough to enter a simple prompt &ldquo;dog, frisbee, run, meadow&rdquo; and expect the generated result to be copyrightable. In this case, the author could not entirely control the result created by AI, but the author might use this prompt as a starting point. The point is that when using generative AI tools, there are ways for artists to control the outcome enough to yield an intended result through detailed prompts and edits. <br/><br/>Let&rsquo;s take the case of Kristina Kashtanova&rsquo;s graphic novel &ldquo;Zarya of the Dawn.&rdquo; In a letter related to this issue, Van Lindberg stated &ldquo;this process included multiple rounds of composition, selection, arrangement, cropping, and editing for each image in the Work&rdquo; (2). Lindberg also later makes a distinction between &ldquo;autonomously generated&rdquo; works such as &ldquo;A Recent Entrance to Paradise,&rdquo; and Kashtanova&rsquo;s work, arguing that &ldquo;the visual structure of each image, the selection of the poses and points of view, and juxtaposition of the various visual elements within each picture were consciously chosen&rdquo; (4). Essentially, when considering Kashtanova&rsquo;s process, it is clear that the graphic novel as a whole, including the images, had been created by the author only with the assistance of Midjourney, the AI system used by the author. Much like creators use Photoshop or other tools which have AI functions built within them, Kashtanova used Midjourney to experiment and explore the boundaries of using AI tools. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the concerns many artists have related to the creation of AI-generated content are valid, especially in the case of Jason Allen who entered the artwork &ldquo;Theatre d&rsquo;Opera Spatial&rdquo; into a competition and won first prize. Even though Allen used Midjourney and fine-tuned prompts to create the final work, the author was not transparent about his use of the AI tool. Sure, entering a competition and registering copyright are two separate events, but the point here is there is a clear possibility that the use of these AI systems can hurt other artists. As a result, when considering if a work created with the help of AI is copyrightable, the author or creator will need to be transparent and document their process. In the future, there might be separate competitions for those who use AI systems, as opposed to other traditional means of creation, which might also mean a new set of ways for the Copyright Office to evaluate works specifically created with the use of AI tools similar to Midjourney. <br/><br/>&ldquo;The law and policy of the Office should not focus on the specific tools authors use, but how those tools can be used to create works that meet the legal standards for copyrightability.&rdquo; <br/>&ndash; Van Lindberg <br/><br/>Overall, the current decision considering Kashtanova&rsquo;s case is relatively fair given there are other elements within her work that are clearly copyrightable, such as the text and arrangement of the images; however, moving forward, there should be more leniency when considering &ldquo;human authorship&rdquo; and the use of generative AI. If an author uses hundreds of prompts, or hundred word-length prompts as Kashtanova did, it is an intentional decision made by the artist, not to mention the edits that may come after. Given that the images in Kashtanova&rsquo;s are not currently copyrightable, someone can legally take them, which would lead to redundancy and de-value the creative input and originality of Kashtanova&rsquo;s graphic novel as a whole. Copyright law is meant to protect, but it can also incentivize artists to experiment and create. Given the birth of these new technologies, caution severely granted, it is important to allow creators slightly more freedom in using AI tools by altering perceptions of what constitutes as &ldquo;human-authored&rdquo; art. <br/><br/>Notes: <br/><br/>*Of course, this discussion is only limited to AI generated images, and does not discuss music/audio, or video content created with AI tools. I just wanted to emphasize the importance of altering perceptions concerning AI generated art and copyrightability. <br/><br/>*Even though the Copyright Office obviously knows about Kashtanova&rsquo;s case, I have attached my copy just in case. <br/>
