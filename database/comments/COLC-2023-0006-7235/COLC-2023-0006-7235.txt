Generative AI has used several of my artworks without any notification or permission given. I&#39;m a small time artist with a business owned and operated by myself alone. Since the release of generative AI I have noticed not just a decline in project opportunities but also an increase in caution about artwork in general. Since our artwork is used in &#39;training,&#39; others can replicate our works within minutes and sell their services for a fraction of what it took to create the training material. Generative AI is used almost primarily in this way as a &#39;get rich quick scheme&#39; by morally ambiguous individuals that will quit and move on after they&#39;ve undercut each other to the point that it&#39;s no longer profitable. But in that process they will have burned away the livelihoods of many and left this career path in ashes.
