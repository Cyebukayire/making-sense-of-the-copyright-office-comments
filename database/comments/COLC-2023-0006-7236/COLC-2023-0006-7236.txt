Frankly, the idea that someone could take my work and use it to train a robot on it, then claim that they created something new is appalling. Why should someone&#39;s work be allowed to be stolen, and the thief be the one to make money off of it? It&#39;s one thing if someone consents to the training, but it&#39;s entirely different if we have all of the AIs training themselves off of random content on the internet that other people put real effort into making. I don&#39;t want my content stolen by AI, and I certainly don&#39;t want someone else to profit from it.
