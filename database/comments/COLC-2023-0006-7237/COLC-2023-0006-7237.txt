Greetings,<br/><br/>I wanted to keep my comment short as I&#39;m not a wordsmith, and I imagine you&#39;ve received a high volume as it is. I wanted to  offer a different perspective that I haven&#39;t seen discussed. <br/><br/>I work as a part-time illustrator. Every individual that pursues this field won&#39;t be able to break into the professional world without years of practice. Usually, it can take between 3 to 10 years (and longer for some) to become competent enough to start working regularly.   In that time, older illustrators will begin to retire and pass the reigns over, allowing for room for new artists to enter the working world. Improving doesn&#39;t just entail practicing a lot - it&#39;s understanding color &amp; light theory, composition, and also understanding from an emotional perspective what a viewer may find appealing in an image. Why this color is more attractive than that color choice, and so on. Understanding how light influences various material and colors under different conditions (sunny weather, artificial lighting, overcast, so on). Art theory alone takes years to fully grasp, just like music theory, and there are no shortcuts for us as individuals. We are simply human. <br/><br/>AI does not need time to learn. It instantly copies - and instantly produces in mass. This is going to saturate the market to the point where a considerable number of working illustrators, artists, graphic designers, and photographers for stock images, will struggle to make a living.  AI can have many, many wonderful applications in others areas such as the medical field, and helping people in genuine ways to better humanity&#39;s suffering.  AI-generated images, especially those trained on copyrighted artwork/photographs for mass production, is only going to help fatten the wallets of the few individuals/ companies that made this sophisticated copying machine.  I&#39;m sure many already have gone over with a fine-tooth comb why this is unethical. This technology simply wouldn&#39;t work as well as it does without having copied billions of images without consent to then produce an amalgamation of said images.  It stole from us, simply, to put us out of a job. But many won&#39;t sympathize with this side of the argument so let me just ask - why would we endeavour to protect companies with unethical practices, over the millions of people this will effect? I&#39;m including voice actors, writers, and musicians when I say &quot;Everyone&quot;. We should aim to create more jobs in this society. This is an example of AI debauchery rather than progress.  Please help us to create guidelines so that we&#39;re not taken advantage of, used, and tossed by those that disregard the negative impacts and the unethical practices for their pursuit of money.  If companies wish to use our work or pay individuals for their works to bolster their tech, please make it so that it&#39;s strictly &quot;OPT-IN&quot; and not &quot;OPT-OUT&quot;.  It should have been &quot;OPT-IN&quot; from the very beginning, but we can all guess why that wasn&#39;t the case - why would they want to compensate when they can just steal?  Thank you for reading.<br/><br/>- A. V.
