Generative Artificial Intelligence is automated plagiarism and nothing more. Ethically, artistic expression and human creativity is not a problem that needs to be solved, much less automated. Legally GAI uses artworks from thousands of artists, many of whom didn&#39;t get to consent, and then uses their work and bastardizes it. Many corporations who make GAI models now offer the ability to &quot;opt out&quot; but that is not enough because any artist who is deceased, not active on that platform, or otherwise does not know about the policy can not consent for their work to be stolen and monetized. GAI is also incredibly dangerous as a misinformation machine able to make convincing fake images that politicians, corporations, or people could use to spread harmful agendas convincingly. <br/>If GAI must exist, which it doesn&#39;t need to, it should, at the very least, be strictly regulated. Corporations that distribute GAI models should not be able to profit from it; any subscriptions to the service should be there only to cover the cost of research and maintenance and to compensate the artists they are taking data from. AI images should not be allowed in any form of advertising or political promotion. GAI models must have their datasets completely stripped, and they should all start over, only using images that people consent to directly. Opt Out systems of consent should be off limits, and strictly Opt-In systems should be put into place for collecting images and artworks for GAI.   GAI needs transparency and fairness to the people it harvests its data from. GAI should always get the consent of the artist, credit the artist, and show what works it used to generate an image and compensate the artist; artists should be paid every single time their images are used. Finally, any production that uses AI art to replace low-level art positions should be taxed; that way, corporations aren&#39;t incentivized to get rid of real human employees for a soulless AI.
