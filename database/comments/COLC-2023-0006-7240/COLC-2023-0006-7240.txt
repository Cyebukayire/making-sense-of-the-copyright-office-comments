I am 19, a college student interested in entering the art labor force in the future. <br/><br/>Issue 1: Previously copyrighted material should not be used in training data sets without compensation. Companies with fair terms pay artists to create images and artwork, often with a a percentage of the profits going back to the original creator. The original creator must be fairly compensated for use in training data sets. Companies already exploit artists. It should be illegal to further exploit them by feeding their own artwork into a machine to generate new combinations, and profit from them, all while not compensating the artist for doing so. Without the artists&#39; work, the company would have nothing to produce. <br/>Similarly, general datasets like &quot;internet crawlers&quot; should not exist. In ethical terms, there are images and photos of real people that did not consent to the use of those images to exist in a general data set. They are not being compensated for it. Artworks that people commissioned and paid for, and did not consent for use in a data set. That is stealing. That is copyright infringement. That is a violation of consent. If you cannot/will not control what data is going into your machine, you should not be allowed to run it. Copyright and privacy protections exist for a reason. If it&#39;s illegal for a regular person to do, it should also be illegal for a company. <br/><br/>Issue 2: &quot;Control&quot; over an &quot;ai&quot; data collager through prompting does not count as &quot;authorship&quot;. As it stands, &quot;AI&quot; is not just a tool. A tool is something designed to help complete one specific task, and requires a learned skill to complete the task. A pen is a tool. You have to learn how to write. You can&#39;t tell a pen to write something, and have the pen write it for you. &quot;AI&quot; takes no skill. Anyone with the barest amounts of literacy can use it. Having thoughts or an imagination is not a skill. Telling a machine to make something for you instead of learning how to make the thing is not a skill. The amount of &quot;authoring&quot; done is negligible compared to the work done by the machine itself, and absolutely imperceptible compared to the labor and skill used by the artists, photographers, models, etc. of the work that the machine is trained on. <br/>A comparison for prompting a machine generative image collager is having a loaf of bread delivered to your home, and claiming that you made the bread. You had the idea that you wanted a loaf of bread, but were not involved in any of the processes of growing or choosing ingredients, transportation, the actual making of the bread, packaging, pricing, learning of the different options to make bread, choosing which loaf to buy from the stock available. The only thing you contributed is the thought &quot;I want bread&quot;. Should you be allowed to copyright your loaf of bread, without compensating or acknowledging anyone else involved in the process? You can copyright and keep a recipe secret, but you can&#39;t take someone else&#39;s creation, or even a slice of different types of loaves to create your own multi-flavor loaf of bread, and copyright that. That&#39;s considered stealing. It needs to be considered stealing to do the same to art and photos. <br/><br/>Issue 3: Assuming copyrighted data is compensated for and/or not in the data set, it is physically impossible to predict exactly which variables might create something that is substantially similar to something copyrighted. With enough data, you can generate something that resembles a copyrighted piece regardless of the actual data in the set. It is the user&#39;s responsibility to check their generations and not use them for monetary purposes if it does resemble a piece that is not fair use. At that point, the machine is a tool that can be used in any way. It is impossible for any group of people to monitor a widespread tool for &quot;proper use&quot;. It is not the fault of a knife production company if a consumer purchases the knife and uses it to stab another person. That being said, there should be a contract between the company that owns the machine and the user that uses their product that waives the company&#39;s legal responsibility and consequence that a user might incur from using the tool, that would prevent this from being a problem. If a company is found to have violated copyright rules by including copyrighted data in the dataset that was not allowed, then that would be a separate charge solely to the company for copyright infringement.<br/><br/>I am 19, and looking to go into the art labor force as a career option. But this is becoming more difficult as my skill is considered insufficient and unworthy by companies in favor of &quot;AI&quot; art, works of other artists that did not consent to their works being used. I want to live, and have a passion, and build my skill to the level of a master. I can&#39;t do this if companies take art I posted for free on the internet for real people to look at and use it to generate images instead of hiring me because it&#39;s cheaper to use AI.
