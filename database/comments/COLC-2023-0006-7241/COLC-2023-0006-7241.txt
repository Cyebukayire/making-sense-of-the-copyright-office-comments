I was looking at the copyrightable material that AI creates. I noticed an industry that seems to struggle is the creative industry. Looking at the video game industry, it seems to be impacting it a lot. As games are created using coding techniques, many AI will take in other people&#39;s work and learn and get smarter. With this, people have already used only AI to create games. The AI can create the code and art for the game. However, I see issues with how creative and ethical this is. Looking at how video games are created without AI, you can see a human touch on these games. Many AI-created games have an issue where they lack human connection and joy for the games. I feel many games have great storytellers as well and make the story enjoyable. If a video game company wants to, they can use AI to create a story for a video game with dialogue and everything. Thus getting rid of needing writers to make a video game. This will cause people to lose jobs due to AI. The issue with this is that Ai creates the stories from other texts it has access to to create its own. Thus, you must look into what parts are copyrightable when using AI. The story written, coding used, and art would be significant areas to review and look into in the video game industry.
