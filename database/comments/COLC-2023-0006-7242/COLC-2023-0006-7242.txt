I believe that copyright law has needed reform for a long time. I think this A.I. problem would be a great time to seriously reconsider and take a close look at copyright law and perhaps make some big changes. Since we know that the A.I. will be able to create anything in a manner of seconds, there will be no possible way that any smaller creatives can enforce their copyright, and because of this, copyright law will only benefit corporations (since they are going to be the only ones with the resources to enforce their copyright). In my opinion that is pretty disgusting, but is also not too far off from how copyright law has been going already. I don&#39;t believe copyright law, as it was before A.I. was introduced to the scene, was ever helping any lower class US citizen keep food on the table ever since the invention of the internet. As far as I&#39;m aware, in order for copyright law to work for you, you have to be enforcing it yourself, that means if there are enough people making or &quot;stealing&quot; your ideas, if you don&#39;t have a massive team dedicated to enforcing your copyright then you don&#39;t get to keep it. <br/>This means that in an A.I. age, an A.I. can mass produce &quot;stolen&quot; ideas at such a rate that nobody, possibly not even the corporations can keep up with enforcing it unless there are copyright enforcement A.I. made to do just that.<br/><br/>That sounds like an awful A.I. arms race and again, the only people who will have the resources to build copyright enforcing A.I. are going to be the corporations. How about instead we completely restructure copyright (and possibly patent) law? Copyright is by nature a legal monopoly, which harms the free market. As I hope I pointed out, unlike when copyright law may have first been introduced, copyright law today is already unable to protect individuals. The amount of time that copyright lasts for before a property enters the public domain is also ridiculously long. Copyright is in effect until 90 years after the creator&#39;s death. That is two entire lifetimes. A legal monopoly for two entire lifetimes. I have no idea how the law came to be this way when originally copyright was only in effect for a more reasonable 14 years. But yeah, I think that&#39;s ridiculous and inhibits the growth of the free market, our country, and the entire human race. Also, since corporations can purchase intellectual property in their entirety from the creatives, they can profit off of a dead person&#39;s idea while the rest of the world has to wait. I don&#39;t know, but it just seems rather disgusting and in favor of massive corporations again.<br/><br/>What do I suggest instead?<br/><br/>1. The first thing that needs to change is that copyright terms absolutely must be shortened or eliminated to prevent corporations from abusing copyright law and their obtained intellectual property just because they have the most money. If we must have copyright, let it be for a short time, 20 years. Although I think we should replace copyright law with something entirely different, which I will pitch below.<br/><br/>2. Instead of copyright, let&#39;s do credit rights. make all ideas public domain, but you must credit the works of others. In the same instances where a creator could sue for copyright today, make it so they can only sue if they aren&#39;t credited for their work. This will allow ideas to flow naturally as they should, but make sure nobody is being forgotten by the system. I believe we can create a culture where it is encouraged to redirect the flow of income back at those who inspired your own projects and I think crediting is the way to go. People would be able to collaborate or compete with the progenitors of the ideas that inspire them and they could raise their status together instead of the comparitively selfish hoarding mentality that copyright creates. Either way, this policy would already do wonders more for the individual than copyright can with our current technology and due to how copyright law can really only benefit those who already have money. <br/><br/>How would a crediting system work with A.I?<br/><br/>Well how about we have it so that A.I. generated ideas are not creditable. The machine did the generation after all, and machines do not (currently) have rights. The rights for credit should not then go to the one who operated the machine, but back to the public domain, from which the material for the generated idea was gathered from. If we allow people who simply press a button to generate an idea recieve the rights to that idea, we have failed as a species. <br/>
