Artificial Intelligence in its current form is an unethically made danger to society as a whole, and very dangerous to copyright. The creation of, say, an image generator requires &quot;training data&quot;, i.e. images, to work and pretty much every image generator pulls from training sets made up of billions of scraped, copyrighted images. These images are taken with no consent, and no compensation to the individual or company that has the copyright to that image. The technology runs off of flagrant copyright infringement and only functions by infringing on said copyright. It also creates an absurdly unfair situation for the workers in the industry the AI is tapping into, because how does one argue for better treatment or compensation, when there is a machine that can do the job comparably for no cost and much faster. Not to mention the only reason it works is because it stole billions of copyrighted images from artists, photographers, and even medical records. AI is a force of nothing but evil and shoild be heavily regulated as soon as possible, lest this nation or the world plunge into an age of meaningless, unethically made, mindless slop.<br/><br/>
