Until we can get to a point with AI regulations where we know what data/art/work of other people it was trained on and whether that work was fairly compensated, I find it impossible to consider AI content as material that can have its own copyright. As it currently exists, it is a Frankenstein amalgamation of copyright violations. Many artists, writers, programmers, people from all trades have discovered that their work was scraped without their consent and used to train AI. The AI is not producing anything new or original. It is producing copies. For such patchwork pieces to be considered for copyright protection when they themselves have been blatantly flaunting their disregard for copyright is ridiculous. When a person uses AI to create an image, that image is not being made by that person but rather by the hundreds to thousands of unsuspecting people who&#39;s work is being used by the AI with no respect to their copyright protections.
