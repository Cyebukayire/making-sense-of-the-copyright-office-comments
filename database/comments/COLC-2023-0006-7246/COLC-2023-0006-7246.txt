AI is an unethically made technology that poses many dangers to our modern society as a whole in its current form. First and foremost, AI fragrantly disregards copyright laws with its use of training data. Training data is essentially just images scraped off of the web that image-generative AI uses to &quot;train&quot; to improve at recreating the prompts given to it. These images are gathered from artists, photographers, and even medical records with no consent, compensation, or even credit. These data sets are billions of images in size and continue to grow rapidly every day. This technology threatens the rights of all creative industry workers. How does one bargain for better treatment or payment when a machine can do it comparably for free and faster, they can not. Not to mention the issues that come up with vocal AI using people&#39;s voices to say things they would not say. Not to mention that once the AI can near-flawlessly imitate people no one can tell if it is real or not. Additionally, deepfake technology allows people&#39;s faces to be put into videos, which could be used for some heinous things, Overall, AI needs to be heavily regulated, and fast.
