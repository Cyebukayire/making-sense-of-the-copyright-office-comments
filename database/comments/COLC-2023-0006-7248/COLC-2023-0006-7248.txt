AI is a threat to livelihood and economy. Another way of &lsquo;the rich get richer, the poor get poorer&rsquo; and here the rich lack quality, are looting those who provide that quality and they are looting the artists, writers etc. in massive quantities. This is unfair and must be banned or the future will darken in no time and even the rich and those who have nothing to fear will drown. Purchasing power will definitely diminish if people are left jobless.
