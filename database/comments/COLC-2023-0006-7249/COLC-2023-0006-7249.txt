As an Artist, Ai hurts my livelihood. It steals what I have already produced and then uses my style to create image I did not. These images have not been commissioned from me but as often result as a loss of business because said art was stolen. AI generated images are trained most of the time -without- artist&#39;s permission as well. If these images are allowed to be copywrited there is no reason for an artist to ever create original work again. Generators can produce look-alike work in a factions of the time thus are taking away jobs, income and livelihood away from the creative forces that allow AI to be so successful. The very definition of art is something made by -human- hands. You don&#39;t call for a delivery pizza and call yourself a chef. AI art is no different. This is a dangerous tool that needs to be -heavily- regulated. It&#39;s far to easy to create realistic, false images that can be used as &#39;fact&#39; as well.
