I am a man who drawing pictures for my whole life. From the childhood. But all that time to get used to drawing just stolen by ai which doesn&#39;t have any heart and own ego itself. That thing just copy our result with math logics with no efforts. And our creations being violated by developer&#39;s of ai. This isn&#39;t right. Why our effort and love for the art should transfer someone&#39;s improper benefit with no protection. We draw because we like to show and share our art with peoples. There is the line that we should&#39;t cross. Copying other stuff and saying that is my own. AI nowadays is it. We should stop this uncommon thing right now. If we don&#39;t draw. Ai will stay in this levels because they can&#39;t develop in common way. I wish you could listen to me. This is not just for us. It&#39;s for future that everyone&#39;s right being protect and not exploit others.
