In response to question 9.1. Should consent of the copyright owner be required for all uses of copyrighted works to train AI models or only commercial uses?&thinsp;[47] <br/><br/>Yes, I believe that consent should be required for all uses of copyrighted works that are training AI models. Many of the career fields that AI is largely affecting right now are creative fields. If this question is presenting the concept that income is lost only through the use of AI in commercial use, that is not the case.<br/><br/>For example, many digital artists earn their living on drawing commissions. These transactions are mainly customers requesting art for personal use, not commercial. If AI is not required to gain consent from the copyright owner/artist for this non-commercial use art, it will still be directing customers away from the artist, and thus, losing their income.<br/><br/>A few questions to consider:<br/><br/>If consent was only required for commercial works, would the original creators that the AI was trained on be earning income based on the revenue those commercial works brought in?<br/><br/>Should AI generated-content be something that people can use to make their own copyrighted material with? Isn&#39;t copyright in effect the moment a person puts a pen to paper, or puts their hands to the keyboard? If the AI material that was generated was based on a human&#39;s creation, and their consent was not obtained, that sounds like a violation of that person&#39;s copyright.
