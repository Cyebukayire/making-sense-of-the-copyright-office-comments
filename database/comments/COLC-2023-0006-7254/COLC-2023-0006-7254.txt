I am a freelancer artist and a portrait event artist who works in NYC. AI has and would impact my work further if you allow any of these AI steal artwork to allow to make new ones since it violates copyright of other artwork they have borrowed, do not want to pay the original artists of these designs and would cut a huge portion of the creative industry without jobs. This would affect hundreds of American&#39;s economies heavily by enabling the use of AI in legislation.
