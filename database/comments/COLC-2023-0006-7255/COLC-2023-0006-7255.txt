Outputs from Generative Artifical Intelligence should not qualify for copyright and would represent a large avenue for abuse if allowed. How would an &quot;AI&quot; be defined - there is no definition of AI that can exclude something like an algorithm which systemically outputs every possible book or piece of art (in fact it already exists: https://libraryofbabel.info/) this would instantly make all possible books and images instantly copyrighted. I imagine warehouses set up with racks of servers generating trillions of images in an effort to go after anyone who might have accidentally created a simliar image to one of the trillions or quadrillions of generated ones. Secondly, I am pretty sure one can recreate the training data of the model by not inputting a prompt as theorized/explained by this social media post: https://mastodon.social/@Guildz@lgbtqia.space/111157296893706619
