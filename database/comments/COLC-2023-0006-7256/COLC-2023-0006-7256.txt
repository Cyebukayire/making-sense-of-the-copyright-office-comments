I, an artist who barely makes a tank of gas off their craft, is concerned with images generated by artificial intelligence. Sites like Midjourney are banking it with subscriptions while the program creates images from inputted prompts. How is this possible?  The machine is trained by other images, which a HUGE majority of these images have been used to train things like Midjourney without our say-so. Permission was not reached out to any of us. I also had a couple things inputted into a dataset without my knowledge or say-so. Trying to &quot;opt out&quot; is also a pain and I shouldn&#39;t have had to go through a process of opting out when I should have never had work in a dataset to begin with. None of us should have. I think this is unfair. As for copyrighting the AI &quot;art,&quot; there shouldn&#39;t be copyright.  The person inputting the prompts to get the images aren&#39;t creating anything. Put it this way, if someone comes up to me and says &quot;draw me a purple elf jump-roping with a python&quot; who&#39;s the artist? Me or the person who asked me to do so? We always consider the person creating the image as the artist and the person providing description as a client. These people inputting AI prompts aren&#39;t creating art. The machine is doing it. Sounds like when someone commissions an artist. However, copyright only applies to humans. Not machines. Hence, those AI-generated images should NOT be subject to copyright. The people inputting the prompts are NOT artists. The machine is considered the artist in this (however, this machine is fed with material it had no permission to feed on).  It&#39;s  just the same as a client telling an artist &quot;Paint me a tiger playing fetch with a flaming Christmas wreath.&quot;
