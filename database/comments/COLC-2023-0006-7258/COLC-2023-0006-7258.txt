Hello. <br/>As an artist, I want to have protection against AI. AI has bad impact on creativity: unique films, games, original stories. It destroys artists. Artist&#39;s illustrations should be protected because it&#39;s valuable data and AI companies don&#39;t pay for using our works. It&#39;s not fair. If nobody would pay to the artists, in the future there will be no artists. No artists - no new training data. It&#39;s dangerous future even for AI. Future without anything new and creative. Future with boring similar content everywhere. Fake news, deep fakes and ai-scam - it&#39;s also our future. It&#39;s serious problem and needs to be regulated.
