As more and more time goes by with no significant regulations I&rsquo;m starting to lose my hope. Creativity and creative industry is losing. As an actual artist generative AI tools are a nightmare and actual artists did not want or need these tools. Quality of art is decreasing already because of consumerism and copyright infringement always something to worry about, not to mention how hard is it to find a job in this field already. GenAI is a perfect tool for companies who don&rsquo;t want to respect real people and want to replace humans to save money. Furthermore, these datasets have been trained on copyrighted data and these company CEOs are not even ashamed of it. These greedy companies need to be punished. They should rebuild their datasets excluding ALL copyrighted data, and they should stop common crawl on the web and publish their sources for the training openly so we can see copyrighted data are not being used. Apart from digital art actors/voice actors and music need to be protected too. They too shouldn&rsquo;t be just a free fuel to the datasets. It&rsquo;s shameful for humanity itself that this is how it&rsquo;s going now.
