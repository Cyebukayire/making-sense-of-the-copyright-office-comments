Open source AI, as an artist, goes against everything we stand for. The individuality of an artists pieces is something that should not be replicated without permission, and ESPECIALLY not sold. Marketing and networking is incredibly important for our career path, and in order to do that, our art must be posted on the internet. For that art to be snatched up by open source AI and replicated without a thought is disgusting and in the long run, could ultimately unravel artistry as a career path entirely. Copywriting your own art is another thing, the process takes time and money that we cannot receive if we don&#39;t have access to this networking and, again, art needs to be posted on the internet for that to happen. Artificial intelligence (at least, it&#39;s branch in art,) needs to come to a stop, or at least have better regulations.
