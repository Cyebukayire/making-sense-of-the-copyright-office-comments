The purpose of copyright law is to prevent creators from having to compete against themselves in the intellectual marketplace, from taking the work of others and squeezing the original creator out of the byline by force. GenAI is a technology designed explicitly with this purpose in mind, to use the very works and intellectual property of creatives as a weapon against them and profit off of their work, without consent or compensation. The very databases these AI models operate upon are filled with private information, copyrighted material, and even depictions of criminal activities, such as child exploitation. <br/><br/>A world where AI technology is unregulated will be no different from a world where intellectual property doesn&#39;t exist. It is a world of thieves and con men who seek to profit from the works of others without consent or compensation, and where people will be unable to trust that anything they see online is even real.<br/><br/>There are no positives from this tech being allowed to run rampant. It is designed from the ground up to lie, to steal, and to ruin.
