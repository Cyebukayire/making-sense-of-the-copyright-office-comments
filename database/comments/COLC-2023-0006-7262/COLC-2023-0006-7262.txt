AI can be an invaluable tool for scientists and artists, especially beginners. Like all good things, there must be moral and legal limits.  Anything that attempts to replace, replicate or steal from a living (or deceased), sentient being must be prohibited unless permission is obtained and compensation has been justly rendered.  AI, handled correctly, legally, can take us to the stars and back but it must be controlled and monitored by humans.  As someone who has just had my intellectual property stolen by two WGA writers, I now seek protection from any IP thieves, human or AI, and copyright everything.  I&#39;d like to see additional protections added, i.e. copyright laws expanded.  Also, I&#39;d like to see copyrights that were originally done by mail, digitized and added. I know the script was copyrights but an online search failed to produce the copyright document. In fact, a search failed to produce two online copyrights that I had copies of.  It took two investigation attempts by Copyright staff for those copyrights to surface.  There are obvious issues within the U.S. Copyright system.  If it&#39;s so easy for a human to steal, I can only imagine how easy it would be for an AI entity with access to billions of original human generated IP, re-hash and reproduce with minimal changes could be a serious threat.
