In the question to whether not AI works should be allowed copyright, I want to ask a question: If someone went into an artists home with a camera and snapped a picture of a piece they made, then a picture of all their work , then mashed all those pictures together without the consent of the artist would you call that theft? AI is not stealing individual images they are ripping the technique and style of an artists work. It is not an exaggeration to say we study all our lives to achieve the results we do. To have a program compile it without our consent and have someone sell that is theft. the poorly executed and bland pastiche that these programs make are not a replacement for real artists. The idea that someone can come and take the language of media that we&#39;ve created and claim it as their own with no understanding is an insult and it should not be allowed. Please try to understand.
