As an independant 3D artist and graphic designer, I am convinced that images created through Ai image generators like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion or Dall-E, shouldn&rsquo;t be copyrightable.<br/><br/>As long as their technology is fueled with the uncompensated labor of every artists that have been stolen to train it, it would be very unfair to be put in competition against it. Human artists spend their entire career sharpening their skills so they can provide a special service that differentiate them from the others. It took monthes for these big corporations to scrape the entire web and art from all around the world without asking for any legal and/or financial arrangement.<br/><br/>As long as these corporations refuse to retrain their Ai generators the legal way, I mean on REAL open source libraries or with fairly compensated data, and to be transparent with it, we should not allow them to sell their product.<br/><br/>Trusting you to take the right decision.â€¨<br/>Thank you for reading me,<br/>Adrien Requin
