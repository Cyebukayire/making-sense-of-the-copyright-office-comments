AI at its core is just a hi-tech aggregator of the creative work of millions of uncompensated creators and workers. <br/><br/>As a producer, filmmaker, stock footage provider and the plaintiff in Allen v. Cooper I continue to be dismayed by the blatant and ongoing theft of our intellectual property by AI companies. <br/><br/>For example, doing a quick search for my own unique content of footage from the Blackbeard&rsquo;s Queen Anne&rsquo;s Revenge Shipwreck Project on the &ldquo;Have I Been Trained&rdquo; website, I discovered that at least three of my copyrighted &amp; watermarked images (HIBT Screen Shot 2023-10-06 at 8.59.35 AM.png &ndash; attached) had been scraped. These images and my personal work/industry/creations were stolen without my knowledge, permission or license. Who knows what other images and video have been illegally appropriated from my still and video collections by AI companies? And, even if I&rsquo;m aware of the misuse of my intellectual property by AI pirates, what remedies do I have in this &ldquo;after the fact situation?&rdquo;<br/><br/>In a pattern of behavior even Charles Dickens would recognize the tech industry has shamelessly made indentured servants of us all, monetizing our work and creations without compensation while simultaneously monetizing our creative output for their own financial gain. <br/><br/>Frederick (Rick) Allen<br/>Nautilus Productions LLC<br/>
