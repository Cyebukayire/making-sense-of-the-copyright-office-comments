Artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) systems and the content they create have no reason to be protected by copyright. Current AI programs are not creating things, all they are doing is taking input, input that has often been taken without the consent of the original creator, and spitting it out in a slightly different order. There is no act of human creation in this process and the purpose of copyright law is to protect the human who created something. <br/><br/>At this point AI programs should be regulated that any content input in them must have the permission of the copyright holder to be part of that dataset. The data set for AI programs must be accessible to ensure this is the case. And, any content that comes from this program can not be protected by copyright.
