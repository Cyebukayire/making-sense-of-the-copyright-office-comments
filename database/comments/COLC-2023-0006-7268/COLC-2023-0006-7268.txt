I&#39;m concerned about copyright, emotional AI and private data. If someone chats with an AI, and it gathers the emotional data about someone, it now has a dataset about that person. I know that works produced by AI cannot be copyright protected, but this is a unique dataset about me that could potentially reach the hands of companies that want to sell me things based on my emotional data. How can I be sure that generative AI isn&#39;t using those datasets gathered about me as training materials that could be mined by companies that could in turn use that data to sell me things based on my emotional state?
