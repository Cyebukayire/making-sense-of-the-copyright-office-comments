With regard to the use of copyrighted works to train AI models, the appropriate levels of transparency and disclosure with respect to the use of copyrighted works, and the legal status of AI-generated outputs, I think there can be no better guide from which to start the conversation than the recently drafted points in the tentative WGA / AMPTP agreement on the subject. <br/><br/>Copyright protects the value of Authors&#39; and Inventors&#39; works. The advent of AI systems does not supersede those protections nor does it warrant carve-outs or special considerations.<br/><br/>The simple fact is that AI software does not create. AIs&#39; processes, as defined even by the companies that have developed them, amount to nothing more than exceptionally sophisticated systems analysis. They rearrange, synthesize, and outright plagiarize in order to fulfill whatever request is presented to them. The foundation of their design, the core of their functionality, and the result of their process is verisimilitude, not originality. These products and processes of AI systems are not designed to be Original or Creative at any stage or to any degree. Any product they produce is recombinant at best.<br/><br/>Copyright holders should be compensated for use of copyrighted material for AI training<br/><br/>AI generated content trained on copyrighted works should be fully disclosed.<br/><br/>The legal status of AI generated outputs with regard to copyright materials seems to be a more nuanced question. At the very least, if these systems at any point are determined to have generated original creative work, it raises the question whether the copyright should rightfully belong to the systems themselves. Unless an AI system determined to be capable of creating original work enters, of their own volition, a binding work-for-hire agreement with any company or individual that employs their services, is there any reasonable argument to be made as to why the &quot;owners&quot; or &quot;employers&quot; of those systems should retain the sole benefit of the systems&#39; original creative work? Any determination that an AI is capable of generating original creative work, to me, seems inseparable from considering an AI awarded that right in the same way we would an individual human Author or Inventor under the law.
