I believe it is unethical for AI to make use of copyrighted work with no limitations. While this is naturally a complex new consideration in our modern world, I think it is easy to recognize that copyright is in place to protect human creators. When their work is included in training data sets for AI to include in their algorithm, it is nothing short of theft. How so? The content the AI is capable of generating is exclusively due to the skill and creativity of the human creators who have been fed into the metaphorical woodchipper to create tasteless sawdust. We do not yet have clear guidelines and boundaries around integrating the use of AI, which is leading to malicious users of AI running rampant over the livelihood of real, living humans. It is crucial that the rules and regulations around copyright can be updated to reflect this unusual and unforeseen manipulation of intellectual property.<br/><br/>Artificial intelligence has a place. We haven&#39;t yet established the clear boundaries of that place &amp; if we don&#39;t now, it is possible we never will. The first step is to disallow the rampant copyright violations that are currently happening by restricting AI use of copyrighted material. There has been precedent that AI cannot generate copyright-protected works as AI is not human. Why should an AI software then be able to use copyright-protected works in its dataset? The protections for using copyright-protected works (eg, for parody or homage) assume that a human is using these works to create a new, potentially copyright-protected work. Considering the ruling that AI cannot generate copyright-protected work, why should AI have access to the same opportunities as human creators to use existing copyright-protected work?<br/><br/>Please review the position AI holds in relation to original creations of work and do the fair thing. AI should not benefit from misuse of copyright-protected work. Limit or outright ban AI use of copyrighted work in its datasets.
