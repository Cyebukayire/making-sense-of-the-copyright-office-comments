When it comes to the advent of any new technology, it&#39;s easy to cling to the past and to use people who might be hurt by the new tech as some sort of argument against adapting it. When elevator workers striked, they were replaced, after all, and all capitalistic companies WILL seek to replace paid labor with unpaid labor if able. So as technology advances, and more and more people are pushed out of their respective careers, we need a way to make sure these people are taken care of. <br/><br/>And AI WILL displace jobs, make no mistake. But the answer isn&#39;t to resist change, but to embrace it. And in so doing, acknowledging the pain that comes with the progress. <br/><br/>The advent of AI is yet another marker that we need strong social safety nets, and even, dare I say it, Universal Basic Income (UBI). Technology should free us, not shackle us. The automatic check-out shouldn&#39;t spell the death of cashiers as people, it should be their liberation, freeing people from having to do bullshit jobs.<br/><br/>So in that way, I think AI is a good thing. It&#39;s, ultimately, a bullshit job to draw art in bulk. But we MUST ensure that the people who are displaced by these new technologies are taken care of. We, as a species, could live in a post-scarcity world. There&#39;s genuinely no need for people to burn their lives away doing meaningless tasks.
