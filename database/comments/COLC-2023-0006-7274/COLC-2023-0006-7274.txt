Thank you for this opportunity.  As a published author of books and articles, my primary concerns fall into two area: proper attribution when using copyrighted material, and processing copyrighted material through an AI system that will created new services and products without compensation to the creators of copyrighted material used in the creation of those services and products.  Some of those new products and services may directly compete with the authors or limit their opportunities to rightfully gain from their work.  There must be clear guidelines and auditable systems to compensate authors in the cases of concern above.  Transparency in the use of copyrighted material must also be a standard.  Penalties for misuse must be clear and enforced.  The Copyright office may be well served to create future scenarios on the evolution in this space, as AI technologies will advance quickly and allow for offering not currently foreseen.  Thus the Office should monitor developments and be in a position to put new regulations and standards into place.
