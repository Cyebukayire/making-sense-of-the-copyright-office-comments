Anything made with artificial intelligence should NOT be protected by any copyright laws. It uses resources based on productions that have been made by humans. There are certain levels to which I do see it welcomingly being protected. With the videogame industry, there are a number of games that use procedural generation, which alters how things are done in a game, mostly with where things are located or what items spawn. That is within the code being used for someone&#39;s own creation, and I don&#39;t see an issue when it&#39;s in relation to that.<br/><br/>Artwork, movie/tv scripts, a lot of college papers that have probably already been submitted often rip down on the creativity we already have. There is already a difficult time for small-time artists and writers to get their work taken down when someone submits it; why make it harder?<br/><br/>Another concern is that others are using AI artwork to modify pieces of children in sexual situations. Sites like Gelbooru host AI artwork of children in those situations, which I know is not the focus of the reason for this comment but I need to express my concern all the same. Allowing copyrighted images of real minors put in sexual situations by AI programs is far from okay, as are those of real-life people in general.<br/><br/>Overall thoughts, procedural generation or when you&#39;re using AI tools for things you already own is one thing, but using other people&#39;s resource/art/text/pictures should not allow for it to be copyright protected.
