Corporations should not be allowed to push out artists and writers by replacing them with AI generators, nor should people have to deal with their likenesses (image, voice) being used without their consent to push actors out of work as well as creating slanderous imagery or provocative images to distribute. AI creation, specifically, needs regulation and corporations should not be allowed to abuse it for profit at the detriment of human creators. This has been demonstrated by the strikes and outcry from writers, actors, artists of all types. I do not agree with restricting all instances of similar work since that can constrain fan created works or even inspired works, but people should not lose their jobs over lack of regulation or holding corporations accountable for their greed.
