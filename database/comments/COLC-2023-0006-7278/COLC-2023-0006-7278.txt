The creation of artwork through AI relies on the AI using accessible data online to generate its artwork. Such artwork ought to not be copyrightable on behalf of the AI machines or their owners. First, understanding how AI generates these artworks is important. The process is as follows:<br/>&quot;To create AI-generated art, artists use AI as a creative tool and work with algorithms to set up specific rules through which machines analyze thousands of images to comprehend a particular creation process, like a specific style or aesthetic.&quot; https://magazine.artland.com/ai-art/#:~:text=To%20create%20AI%2Dgenerated%20art,a%20specific%20style%20or%20aesthetic.<br/>This shows us that AI requires the analysis of pre-existing artwork/data to generate its own artwork which utilizes trends the machine observed. The reliance upon the trends in the data is why AI ought to not be copyrightable. These machines rely on the artwork of other artists, specifically the common themes in the artist&#39;s work, to make its own &quot;unique&quot; artwork. When writing an essay, using the theme/trend of another author without crediting them is considered a violation of copyright, so why would artwork be any different? It should not be any different. <br/>Maintaining consistency in ruling is important as to set clear, unambiguous boundaries for AI companies. Ambiguous policies simply mean weak policies, and weak policies are in the best interest of the AI companies not the consumers or artists in which AI is using their artwork. To maintain such consistency, the previous decision, to deny the copyright of AI artwork due to copyright law only extending to human beings, must be upheld. <br/>Without clear, consistent rules, AI artwork can continue to exploit the works of artists across the world. This exploitation then puts revenue in the pockets of AI companies without recognizing or paying artists for their work. <br/>AI artwork ought to not be copyrightable as the artwork only exists by manipulating the work of human artists to make its own work. The term used to describe this work is &quot;derivative&quot;. As mentioned, doing this with a published text would be deemed a violation of copyright. AI should not be an exception to the already established expectation of copyright laws. Allowing this work to be copyrightable means that the revenue for AI companies is more important than protecting the work of artists.
