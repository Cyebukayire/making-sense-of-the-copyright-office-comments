I am concerned about the use of AI tools by companies to devalue the labor of people in many fields or trades or work. We have seen in the case of the current screenwriters strike in Hollywood with a central issue is the studio&rsquo;s interest in pushing for AI into the entertainment industry since it&#39;s cheaper than paid human labor in creating content. (Rogin, 2023) As well the issue of studios using AI technologies to have their bodies and voice scanned to be used for future productions. Furthermore I shared the same concern as the screenwriters and actors on the central issue is companies using AI technologies to limit or exclude workers from the production process. This is an issue that touches on copyright since how will future regulations account for companies devaluing creators whose work is used to be manipulated by AI technologies for production purposes. According to the US Copyright Office&rsquo;s Statement published on March 2023, &ldquo;Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence&rdquo; , <br/><br/>&ldquo;If a work&rsquo;s traditional elements of authorship were produced by a machine, the work lacks human authorship and the Office will not register it 26 For example, when an AI technology receives solely a prompt 27 from a human and produces complex written, visual, or musical works in response, the &ldquo;traditional elements of authorship&rdquo; are determined and executed by the technology&mdash;not the human user. Based on the Office&rsquo;s understanding of the generative AI technologies currently available, users do not exercise ultimate creative control over how such systems interpret prompts and generate material. Instead, these prompts function more like instructions to a commissioned artist&mdash;they identify what the prompter wishes to have depicted, but the machine determines how those instructions are implemented in its output.&rdquo;  <br/>(US Copyright Office, 2023)<br/><br/>There is a crucial need to distnigh and label work that is author by human created and AI created. Copyright applies to works created by humans and not AI since people do not have complete control and direction of machine learning processes. Therefore for the protection of creators, artists, and workers regulations are needed so that copyright works are upheld in face of companies using AI technology to get around not compensating people&rsquo;s labor. <br/><br/>Citations:<br/><br/>Rogin, A &amp; Corkery, A.
