I personally believe AI art is a form of plagiarizing individuals or groups of people because considering that the internet contains all of the information we choose to share as a person, it will also contain the content or art we choose to share publicly. Artificial intelligence has such access to the internet and is therefore able to take information and learn from it.<br/><br/>The AI art people use is a program run by ai software to look on the internet and search for revelant art pieces pertaining to what the individual wants in their finalized product.<br/><br/>The program then takes all the pieces of art from other people who have already made and uploaded these pieces, without their consent, combines them together into one product.<br/><br/>AI Art plaragirizes people as it steals others art works without their permission and reuploads them into a combined piece. It does not give them credit to the original artist and therefore it directly infringes in the rights of the individual for their copy right laws and creativity of the original artwork being credited to them.
