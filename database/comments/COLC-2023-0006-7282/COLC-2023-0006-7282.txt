Hello, I am an artist and writer who is impacted by the rising AI tech. In the last year, I have watched as AI generated images have flooded the internet. I have seen how people who are usually been able to make ends-meat have lost that extra bit of life saving income due to the rise of AI tech. <br/>These machines are also stealing the works of artists and using them for data training sets, without the rights nor permissions of artists. Copyright of human made works is being stolen, and resold for a profit to the thief. And because the thief has stolen a massive data set to train the machine, the AI is essentially a massive copyright violation printer. That&#39;s not even to say how much money is being stolen by AI tech owners that could have gone to individuals who paid taxes.<br/><br/>AI writing tools are also a major issue. As these things have grown, it has scrapped the works of many writers. These tools take from individuals, and reshuffle the money. There is nothing created by AI, there is only what is stolen and reshuffled by a machine.<br/>It is comparable to a meatgrinder. All parts of the animal go in, the organs, bone, and meat, with no regard for the end product outside of appearing as a burger. With no regard to how these machines, how the end product will poison consumers brains by rotting the ability to create, because AI can do it with stolen parts.<br/><br/>Please pass motions to stop AI image and writing tech. There is no place for these machines in a society that creates and gives. There is no place for machines that are used to violate copyright holders.
