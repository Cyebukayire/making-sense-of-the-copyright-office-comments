I have some thoughts on the copyright issues surrounding the creation of works using AIGC technology. During the model training phase, overly restrictive intellectual property protection of input data significantly hampers the development of the AI industry. This is because training models require large amounts of data, and obtaining all the necessary permissions is nearly impossible from both an economic and efficiency standpoint. Meanwhile, the likelihood of infringement decreases significantly after the output generated through AIGC technology and human intellectual activities. Tests could be established to measure this, namely that if a company&#39;s technology cannot exceed a certain level of originality, then there may be an issue with that technology and relevant restriction or penalty shall be imposed.<br/><br/>On the regulatory level, Japan&rsquo;s Copyright Act was revised in 2018 to include a &quot;flexible limitations clause,&quot; which created conditions for AIGC technology to scrape and utilize copyrighted works. The new clause stipulates that Internet companies can use works without permission from the rights holder if the usage &quot;does not infringe on the interests of the copyright holder&quot; or &quot;the damage to the ownership is minor.&quot; The European Union, on the other hand, officially adopted the &quot;Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market&quot; in 2019, establishing exceptions for text and data mining (TDM) in support of data science and artificial intelligence development. However, this exception does not apply if the rights holder appropriately reserves the right to use the work or other objects.<br/><br/>The approaches of Japan and the EU in this field provide a reference path for current governance on copyright infringement related to AIGC technology. Overall, Japan tends to determine the legality of using copyrighted works with AIGC technology based on the outcome, ultimately relying on a case-by-case analysis. The EU, in contrast, advocates for safeguarding the rights holder&#39;s prerogative to choose in advance to prevent infringement, emphasizing that the development and utilization of data should not infringe on the rights holder&#39;s interests.
