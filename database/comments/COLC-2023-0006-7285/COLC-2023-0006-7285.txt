As an artist who lives off of my work, AI generated images worry me greatly. The threat that I could lose my only income to what is effectively machine regurgitated pattern recognition is a very real one. Not to mention that these AI are trained on stolen materials, so it is effectively always creating plagiarized images. <br/><br/>Another worry of mine is the illegal generation of images and voice clips of real world people, some of which being pornographic in nature. Real people are being imitated, their identities stolen. It&rsquo;s immoral and frightening. <br/><br/>These tools could absolutely be used as tools to help people, absolutely. That is not what people are using them for though. They&rsquo;re using them to steal, to impersonate, and to suck out any joy from one of the few remaining respites from day to day life.
