Hello, my name is Joshua Stacey. <br/><br/>I use AI to create music. I know a lot of people seem to think that AI music generation is just a click and your done. And, while I can&#39;t say for every creation method, I know that with mine, it takes me many ours to produce one song. I spend about 8-12 hours with the initial creation of the song and another 10-12 hours doing post production work on the song. Also, it currently requires a great deal of technical knowledge to even be able to start. My responds to the common comment &quot;It&#39;s so easy and doesn&#39;t take any skill&quot; is, then go do it. If it was so easy, it shouldn&#39;t take long. Yeah, if you really wanted to, you could pump songs out constantly, but you can do that with digital creation software. And just like with digital creation software, your quality is going to suffer from not giving it the time required. <br/><br/>I do not intend to infringe on copyrights, But, since there are a limited number of sounds that a single instrument can make, there is going to be crossover in beats and structures, even without AI. Therefore, I believe that the copyright should only come down to the final product. Is it directly copying someone else&#39;s work? I know that for my music, especially, since it contains lyrics that I have written, there should be no other song that is like mine. My view on the whole AI thing, is that it is similar to digital music creation software such as GarageBand, Qtractor, and LMMS. These programs allow you to create music, digitally, using sampled instrumental sounds, just the same as AI does. AI, at least currently, just suggests what notes should be played next. This is based on it&#39;s understanding of popular song structures. My personal opinion is that, if it could be created with the aforementioned digital creation software, it should be viewed the same way.  <br/><br/>Thank you for reading and have a good day.
