I think that AI should only be able to train on copyrighted works if given explicit permission by the holder of the copyright. Currently, artists and writers are seeing their style and elements of their own creation in AI generated works, which I believe violates copyright. Additionally, not allowing AI to train on copyrighted images could lighten the load of copyright cases. I feel like a lot of artists and authors will file lawsuits over works generated by AI and published by the people who generated them when they see their style/work/wording in the AI-generated work. <br/>
