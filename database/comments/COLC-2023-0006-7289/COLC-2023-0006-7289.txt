Thank you for opening up the issue of AI and copyright to public comment. I am an artist and author and a supporter of other artists and authors which is why I&#39;m commenting today.<br/><br/>I believe the current policies that allow authors or artists exclusive rights to their creative works are extremely important and feel that the training methods of AI violate that. I believe that AI should only train on works where the author or artist has given consent for AI to use it in training. To do otherwise, I believe, would violate an author or artist&#39;s exclusive right to control their work during the copyright period. <br/><br/>I encourage the Copyright Office to adopt the position that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the explicit consent of the creator violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this comment.
