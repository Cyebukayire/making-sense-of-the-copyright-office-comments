(1) the use of copyrighted works to train AI models;  I feel like using copyrighted works to train AI models is not a good idea.  I don&#39;t think AI is a very good thing in general.  I agree with the fact that people can try to use AI for good purposes but I think that AI isn&#39;t good for people who are in need of finding work.  I feel like AI is the reason why so many businesses are shutting down and people are losing jobs.  I think that in order for AI to become better, it needs to be used for reasons that are beneficial and not for something negative.
