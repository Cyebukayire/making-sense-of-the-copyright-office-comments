Generative AI only functions from scraping the entirety of artists&#39; work across the internet, without the consent of said artists. It is being used to replace our skills, labor, and livelihoods using these uncredited resources. Being as the software would be unable to function without our work that we have not consented to it using, it is theft and plagiarism through and through. Until Generative AI has been put under MASSIVE regulations, such as an opt in only system, I can only vehemently oppose any and all usage of it.
