Thank you for providing the opportunity for public comment on these important issues. I am an author and a supporter of authors and artists who is deeply concerned at the use of AI to erode creative people&#39;s rights and livelihoods. Artists and writers whose work is under copyright should give consent to be included in training datasets, and AI training should always be opt-in rather than opt-out (with the exception of older works no longer under copyright, as their use is not actively harmful). Further, I strongly support the ruling that images and writing created by AI should not be eligible for copyright themselves without significant further human manipulation.
