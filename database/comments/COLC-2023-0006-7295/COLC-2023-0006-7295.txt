What generative images (or &ldquo;AI images&rdquo; as so many call them) basically are, in the absolute simplest terms, are the product of a computer that is programmed to take tons and tons of pre-existing images, mix them all together using really advanced programming strategies, and spit out an image that is, when you really boil it down, a HIGHLY advanced form of collage. <br/><br/>Now, there isn&rsquo;t anything inherently wrong with that, collages exist and this extension of the same idea isn&rsquo;t inherently immoral, but it does have several really extremely glaring problems.<br/><br/>One: the people who give the generative image programs (programs such as stable diffusion for a big example) these pre-existing images are not held to the same copyright standards as exist for collage artists. They often take from other people&rsquo;s work both without their consent and without their knowledge, and put that work into these machines&rsquo; databanks from which the machine then mixes things together and outputs these generative images. The artists whose work is taken for this purpose aren&rsquo;t credited or compensated and often don&rsquo;t even have the chance to speak out against their work being used in this way before it&rsquo;s added to the databank. <br/><br/>Which brings us to problem number two: once an artist&rsquo;s work has been added to the databank it is physically and technologically impossible to remove it. Even if the work itself is taken out, it&rsquo;s a case of &ldquo;too little too late&rdquo; because the machine has already used the information it gets from that image and will continue to mix it in with other images for anything that it generates in the future. So this non-consensual use of another&rsquo;s intellectual property is irreversible. <br/><br/>Then there&rsquo;s the final problem: even if we mandated that all existing generative AI programs be torn down completely and rebuilt from scratch, and that going forward people were only legally allowed to use works that were fair-use, bought legally, or consensually obtained from an existing artist--or even that people were only allowed to use their own works to feed into the machine which would be even more restrictive--it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to regulate these restrictions. The nature of generative image technology is such that it pulls from such a VAST stock of images, so it would be nearly impossible to prove that someone had taken your work against your will and added it into the machine, even if you watched them do it and knew with a hundred percent certainty that they had. Even if you could point out exactly where the machine had taken from your image, you would have the impossible task of proving that it had taken it from YOUR image and not from another person&rsquo;s whose art is similar to yours. However, even with this being the case, it&rsquo;s extremely important to point out that the machine would at that point still be taking your hard work and mixing it in with other people&rsquo;s work without your consent, and without any compensation or credit. <br/><br/>This being the case, generative image software, or &ldquo;AI image software,&rdquo; is at best unethical and at worst actual theft of intellectual property, and unequivocally its use should not be permitted.<br/><br/>
