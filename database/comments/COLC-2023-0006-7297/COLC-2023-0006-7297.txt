I am worried that AI will be used to set official government policy. Although computers are assumed to be rational and objective, they recreate the biases of their programmers. For example, many city police departments use crime-predicting software that directs them to surveil neighborhoods that are already over-policed, exacerbating the problem. Policymakers can&rsquo;t be allowed to foist responsibility for handling issues like crime, the environment, and medical care onto unaccountable machines. Whenever possible, the people affected by policy should be the ones who set it, not computers.
