AI-generated content should not be copyrightable as it is created by a machine and lacks human creativity. Granting copyright protection to AI-generated content will stifle innovation and limit the public&rsquo;s access to creative content. Human creativity brings a lot to the table such as imagination, emotions, and experience that go into crafting compelling stories. I can attest as a novelist that lots of emotions go into story writing because inspiration comes from the actual experience in life as time goes on. It reflects the individuality of a human author which brings integrity into the literary world. It shows the hard work and effort that goes into human expression and the dedication that goes into the many hours of writing and art. AI-generated content does not bring a unique perspective, but rather a collection of other experiences that nobody can claim whereas writers such as myself have that unique perspective to offer the world.
