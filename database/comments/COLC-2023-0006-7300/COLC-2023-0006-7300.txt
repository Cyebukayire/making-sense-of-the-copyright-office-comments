I am a digital artist who is concerned with the legality regarding AI use. While artists may reference and be inspired by one another all the time, AI programs are not humans nor operate under the same principles. They are created specifically to replace the artists whose works are being used to train them. As an artist I have never even had a chance to consent or disallow use of my work in training these models.<br/><br/>The fiscal purpose of these tools is to cut operating costs so project owners can hoard a larger share of profits without the need to pay for artists, despite the fact that it&#39;s artists who (unwillingly) made these tools possible in the first place. The same holds true for writers, musicians, and vocalists.<br/><br/>In principle, despite claims from proponents, AI programs are not tools nor are they being used as such; they replace the entire process outright, which in turn is being used to replace people, not assist them.<br/>In practical application, it is also common for proponents to compare AI art generation to digital art programs. However, when said digital art programs were created, they did not require the sacrifice or theft of traditional works. AI generators, however, do require preexisting media to train on and replicate, and create images without significant involvement from their users.<br/><br/>This has severe economic implications for the profession as a whole, which historically has already been a challenging field.  I hope the copyright office will take this matter seriously and respond to the matter of AI and copyright firmly with the goal of protecting artists, workers, and creatives.
