Hello, to whom it may concern I would advocate for the Office to maintain its current policy that AI created works lack sufficient creative control to be copyrightable. AI works and the learning models that power them are vectors for infringement that can train off a wide array of data (photos, videos, sound files, etc.) without express consent nor compensation of the original creators. Further inquiry should be made into how those maintaining these models could reach agreements or properly compensate those whose data they use in their training but the law&#39;s current view of their copyrightable is consistent with a position that supports original work and the compensation thereof.
