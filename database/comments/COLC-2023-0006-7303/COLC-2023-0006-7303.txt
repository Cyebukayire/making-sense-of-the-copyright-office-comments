AI art isn&#39;t art. It&#39;s an algorithm that puts other people&#39;s art in a blender. Art has life, art has the unique feeling of being touched by the human hand, even if it&#39;s digital,  it still has the life and emotions that only a human can put it in. When you blend it altogether, those unique experiences clash, making this &quot;art&quot; feel weirdly emotionless<br/><br/>AI Art places are taking jobs of real artists. Look at the Loki poster. The background wasn&#39;t done by a human. You can tell by the markings on the clock.
