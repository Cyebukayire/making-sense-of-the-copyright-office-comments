I&rsquo;m answering question #5 concerning proposals for legislative items.<br/>I believe there is new legislation that is needed for the U.S. to get a head of the situation that AI presents regarding copyrights.<br/>I&rsquo;m proposing the following legislative ideas:<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI generated materials define any output from a computer program where a human entered prompt is used, and the AI uses a database or large language system it&rsquo;s been trained on to accomplish this generation output.<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI assisted materials are items in which human interaction is still most of the input, but AI acts only in a limited sense such providing suggestive sentence improvements or limited artistic transformations in the part of a digital image.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Produced by AI would mean it has altered digital items 60% or more of the digital work in question. Human authors will still produce anything less than this.<br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI produced works, whether AI generated or AI assisted, maybe copyright protected with an AI Voucher Registration.<br/>5.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI Voucher Registration is only valid for 25 years from publication. Both registration and publication are required for protection. Automatic protections are not granted to works simply printed or published on the internet. Retroactive registration will be granted upon application of works created before legislative adoption.<br/>6.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>All AI generative software or assistive technology may not enforce a copyright upon its licensed users, regardless of fees charged or not.<br/>7.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>All AI generative software or assistive technology must get the rights to any works, and/or systems they have used to allow users to produce their works. This will include works in the public domain if such works still have entities maintaining some control over them.<br/>8.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>#7 would apply for private systems developed and used by any businesses seeking to take advantage of AI generative software or assistive technology for profit.<br/>9.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Human AI Endowment Trust payment will be collected by the United States Copyright Office, with each registration equal to $10 USD. The excise tax funds scholarships for students with artistic or editorial abilities.
