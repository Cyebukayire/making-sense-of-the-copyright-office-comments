I am writing to submit comments on the complex issue of copyright as it pertains to Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models like OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4.<br/><br/>Procurement of Copyrighted Data:<br/><br/>Many language models are trained on web-scraped data, which includes enormous amounts of copyrighted content collected without explicit permission from the copyright holders (sometimes called &quot;piracy&quot;).<br/><br/>This act of scraping and storing copyrighted content for commercial purposes is at odds with the core principles of copyright law, as it does not provide a mechanism for original creators to control or benefit from the derivative use of their works.<br/><br/>Fair Use Claims:<br/><br/>Companies like OpenAI assert that their use of copyrighted material falls under the umbrella of &quot;fair use.&quot; While this argument may have been valid when the data was exclusively used for noncommercial research, now that these AI models are deployed for commercial purposes and available to the general public, their claim to fair use becomes considerably less tenable, especially when examined through the lens of the four factors prescribed by fair use law:<br/><br/>    Purpose and character of the use: These AI models are commercial in nature, used in for-profit applications, which weighs against fair use.<br/><br/>    Nature of the copyrighted work: Web-scraped data often contains a mixture of factual and highly creative content. The presence of creative works in the training data potentially weighs against fair use.<br/><br/>    Amount and substantiality of the portion used: These models are trained on vast datasets, including significant portions or even entireties of copyrighted works, which also weighs against fair use.<br/><br/>    Effect on the potential market or value: The most egregious issue is that the outputs from such AI models can serve as a substitute for original content, negatively impacting the market for the original works.<br/><br/>Impact on Creative Workers:<br/><br/>AI&#39;s capacity to generate content like text, images and video raises alarming ethical questions about its impact on creative professions. The AI models are capable of producing content that directly competes with human creators, without any mechanism for those original creators to be compensated or even acknowledged. This seems to contravene the intentions of copyright law, which aims to foster and protect human creativity.<br/><br/>Justifications for this web scraping are often made by comparing it to that done by search engines like Google.  However, search engines do not generally compete with the original works in any way, and in fact typically increase the market for these works by making them more easily accessible.  Generative AI does not have the same effect on the market that search engines do.<br/><br/>Verbatim Snippets in Network Weights:<br/><br/>The above focuses on the data procurement stage of creating an LLM, which is the most clear-cut copyright violation.  It is also arguably in violation during the training and inference stages.  Though it&#39;s often argued that these models do not store verbatim data, evidence suggests that large models can, at times, reproduce snippets of their training data, raising additional infringement concerns.  (Attached some images I have generated with these models of a &quot;sponge character&quot; and &quot;mouse character&quot;, which are clearly derived from copyrighted works that reside inside the models.)  The fact that this content is &quot;diffused&quot; throughout the network weights does not change the fact that it is there, any more than compressing a copyrighted book into a zip file does.<br/><br/>In summary, both the initial data procurement process and the final commercial applications of these AI models pose challenges to current copyright laws. I urge the Copyright Office to scrutinize these practices and consider how existing regulations might be updated to better protect the rights and contributions of original creators.<br/><br/>While LLMs are tremendously useful, almost all of their value derives not from the work of any AI company employees, but from the work of the many humans who created the training data.  Without that training data, these models would be worthless.  These humans are not being compensated for their work, and are instead being replaced by these machines.<br/><br/>[This comment was written with the help of ChatGPT]
