Allowing artificial intelligence to hold anything resembling a copyright means directly allowing theft from copyright holders whom the model was trained on. Unless models are restricted to being trained on data obtained with the express permission of original owners, I fail to see how this is anything but shameless theft that corrupts the strong artistic culture this country has. Especially seeing that several models currently available have modes designed to outright emulate existing living artists&#39; styles.
