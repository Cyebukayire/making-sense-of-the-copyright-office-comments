ChatGPT, Bard and other large language models (LLMs) are master plagiarists who are engaged in copyright infringement. <br/><br/>When I ask them a question for which I am the dominant subject matter expert, they often copy articles I previously published, verbatim. Even when they don&#39;t copy the article word-for-word, the paraphrase often preserves distinctive fragments from my original articles.<br/><br/>It is in the nature of statistical language models that, when there are just a few articles that are responsive to a question, they will copy significant portions of the articles. It is only when there are many articles that are responsive to a question that the contribution of any one article is diluted within the whole. Nevertheless, there may be distinctive fragments within the LLM&#39;s response to the question. It does not transform the original works, as the LLM does not understand the content, but rather merely parrots back a collection of fragments derived from other works. <br/><br/>Note that large language models are necessarily focused on the content and expression and not on the ideas themselves. They are often characterized as predicting the most likely next word. <br/><br/>They are also not natural persons and therefore cannot be considered as the author of a new work.<br/><br/>The only way that they are able to respond to a question is by relying on responses written by people. Otherwise, why would they need to be trained on the writing of real people, as opposed to a lexicon (dictionary). It is the connecting together of words into text that is fundamental to their ability to respond to questions, and this ordering of words is based on the work of other people. <br/><br/>The responses from large language models are therefore derivative in nature and therefore subject to the original author&#39;s copyright. <br/><br/>When I complained to Google about Bard plagiarizing an article, they treated it like a DMCA takedown request. They did not respond to my request for reasonable royalties or statistics on the number of times they have used my articles in their responses. They should not be able to take my work without compensation. <br/><br/>I have several patents on statistical language modeling, including U.S. Patent 6978419, Method and apparatus for efficient identification of duplicate and near-duplicate documents and text spans using high-discriminability text fragments. So, I have some expertise on this matter.
