My view on the use of copyrighted materials to train artificial intelligence (AI) models comes down to whether the work falls in line with the Fair Use and public domain guidelines. In my mind, the use of scraping copyrighted materials to train AI, pre-trained transformer model algorithms such as ChatGPT, does adhere in principle to fair use doctrine in terms of the data or information is used primarily for educational or research purposes and therefore does not require the copyright owner&rsquo;s permission. Furthermore, there is legal precedent that supports my opinion on the matter as the Google company several years ago won their lawsuit regarding the scraping of book text accessible through their search engine (Appel, 2023, pp. 3-4).<br/><br/>With respect to copyright law, the training data used for ChatGPT, includes &ldquo;in-copyrighted&rdquo; and public domain information which is currently being challenged in class action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and Open AI&rsquo;s large language models. There is a question of attribution and &ldquo;moral rights&rdquo; of the copyright owner; however, the legal standing on the issue in the United States is somewhat shaky. Notwithstanding, the rule of thumb of copyright should always be &ldquo;give credit where credit is due&rdquo;, meaning the assignment of attribution to the work or material (Zeynep &Uuml;lk&uuml; Kahveci, 2023, pp. 2-4). <br/><br/>The issue most concerning to me as a scholar is making sure the source is given proper credit and verifying the authenticity of the citation. Moreover, as the tech companies continue to improve upon their AI products and hash out the legal ramifications regarding copyright fiascos within the legal system, the question is: who owns the copyright of AI-generated content to determine infringement? Therefore, I do not believe there should be regulatory action taken before this question can be clearly answered. This question furthers my point of view that ChatGPT and other transformative search tools should be protected by fair use as the use of the information produced by AI generated systems provides access to content in support of creative, innovative, and educational knowledge (Fair Use Week, 2018). <br/><br/>References<br/>Appel, G.
