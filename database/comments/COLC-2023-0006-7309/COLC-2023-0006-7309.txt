I am an illustrator and a costume designer. I have worked for thousands of hours to develop my technical skills and my way of seeing the world. I believe very firmly that machine learning technology, while it may have other utilities that I cannot foresee, is currently little more than automated plagiarism software. The idea that writing prompts counts as a copyright-worthy amount of effort is insulting to creative labor, and has already negatively impacted the number of jobs available in my industry. I strongly urge the government to consider protecting the rights of artists, and develop regulations that limit the use of AI. I have been participating in communities and sharing artwork online as part of that participation for decades. Imagine the amount of culture and social connection lost if suddenly our most democratic way of sharing creative material put artists at risk of, not just plagiarism (we&#39;ve been dealing with that forever) but unchallenged and in some cases untraceable plagiarism.
