Hello! I am an artist and I take issue with my work being used in the creation of AI software without my permission.<br/><br/>AI tools should only be trained on data that the AI company has explicit permission to use. In the case of AI image &amp; text generators, the technology doesn&#39;t work without the stolen labor / intellectual property of millions of people. The majority of an AI software&#39;s value comes from the use of copyrighted material that they did not obtain permission to use. It&#39;s the only reason it works as well as it does. One of the reasons we have copyright laws is because it is unfair to make people essentially compete with copies of themselves in the marketplace. Since these AI tools were created specifically to replace working human creators (with AI art tools building options to mimic individual artists), they should not be allowed to run roughshod over our intellectual property rights. <br/><br/>Consent to use copyrighted works should not be obtained via an &quot;opted-in by default&quot; model (which is an oxymoron--to &quot;opt-in&quot; is to make a choice.) It goes against the very meaning of the word &quot;consent.&quot; If you don&#39;t ask for permission, you, by definition, don&#39;t have permission. The onus should not be on the consumer to tell AI companies what they&#39;re NOT allowed to use. We need to be opted-out by default, because AI companies need to ask me before they can use my copyrighted materials, the same way any other company would have to.<br/><br/>On the Copyright.gov page regarding fair use (https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/) an argument could be made that *the individual images/text generated by AI* could meet the criteria for #3:<br/>&quot;Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole: Under this factor, courts look at both the quantity and quality of the copyrighted material that was used. If the use includes a large portion of the copyrighted work, fair use is less likely to be found; if the use employs only a small amount of copyrighted material, fair use is more likely.&quot; <br/>But when we consider *the AI software itself as the product*, I would argue that it does not meet fair use because a very high percentage of it is comprised of copyrighted works due to the importance of it&#39;s training data. My work as an individual may only comprise a small percentage of that data set, but that&#39;s only due to the unprecedented scale of the theft. It is not better that they stole from many people vs. just one person. <br/><br/>Part of the purpose behind fair use is to avoid infringing on people&#39;s rights to free expression. But AI tools do not have the same rights as humans, and that&#39;s a good thing. &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; is just a buzzword--at the end of the day, it&#39;s a piece of software. It&#39;s &quot;creative process&quot; is nothing like a human&#39;s. ChatGPT does not have an inalienable right to expression that needs to be protected. <br/><br/>And AI companies are not entitled to keep their ill-gotten billions. They will likely need to re-train their models from scratch with new data sets. They&#39;ve trained them before, they can train them again. Don&#39;t let them tell you it&#39;s not &quot;realistic&quot; (read:&quot;profitable&quot;) to train only on works in the public domain, or to obtain permission to use copyrighted works. It&#39;s their responsibility to audit their training data, it&#39;s a cost of running business. (Besides, they built a magical art generation machine, and now they want us to think something&#39;s &quot;too hard&quot;? I don&#39;t buy it.) There should be transparency into their training data instead of hiding it in a black box, with a pinky-promise that they&#39;ve removed our stolen work. <br/><br/>I&#39;m not trying to outright stop all AI, I don&#39;t doubt that AI will play a role in creator&#39;s processes going forward. I look forward to a future where I can use AI as a tool in good conscience that it is not built on stolen work and isn&#39;t putting all my friends out of business.<br/><br/>Beyond the issues of labor and copyright, AI sets a terrible precedent for data privacy and has a lot of dangerous uses. Technology plays an enormous role in nearly every aspect of our lives today. Silicon Valley&#39;s &quot;move fast and break things&quot; way of doing things needs to be reigned in.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read all this! <br/>&lt;3 Kelly
