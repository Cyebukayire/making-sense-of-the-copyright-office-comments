There are a few issues with the idea of using copyrighted works to train AI models, the first being that if infringement did occur, who would get the punishment? The AI? Or the company who created the AI? Or the person who used the AI to create art that ended up being very similar to a copyrighted work? There are a lot of questions. If those training the AI models could be granted permission by the copyright owners to use their works, then that&#39;s a different story, but I do not see that becoming a reality. <br/>Also, I am not sure if works created generated from AI can really be copyrighted - they may have been created from a prompt made by a human, but that does not mean that they are human made. These prompts are not the same as taking the time to actually create a piece of art or a piece of prose. The AI generates the material from online searches and details that the person who created the prompt never saw. It goes beyond human capabilities and therefore cannot be copyrighted like human made work. That does not mean that work made from a mixture of humans and AI, like the comic book from the Zarya and the Dawn issue, cannot be partially copyrighted. If the art for the work was created by a human but the words were not, then the art could probably be copyrighted but not the words. <br/>Overall, I think more research needs to be done on the various issues and works generated by AI. It&#39;s a very complicated issue that could probably benefit from lots of regulation and rules.
