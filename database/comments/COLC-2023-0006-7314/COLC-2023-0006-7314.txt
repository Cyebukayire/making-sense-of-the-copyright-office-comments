As both a software engineer and a creator, I support strong regulation of AI and do not believe that AI-generated material should be able to be copyrighted. A machine cannot own ideas; any idea generated from AI in truth belongs to the creators of the material used to train the AI. Should AI be able to copyright work, it will lead to even more difficulties for people trying to make a living off art, and should the arts become even more difficult to make a living off of, it will have a negative effect on our culture and our mental health as a society.
