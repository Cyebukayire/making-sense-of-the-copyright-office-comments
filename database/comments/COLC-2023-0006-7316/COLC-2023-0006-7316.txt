AI can be summarized as creatives, curation employees and users being exploited in order to companies make monopolies and fortunes. It is a risk to legit human-made content, culture and the online infosphere. Use copyrighted material for AI training is not fair use since AI is unable create nothing that can be considered new and deprives the copyright owners of income and undermines their market opportunities. A series of new legislation must be made to enforce rules over online sharing platforms, AI companies, developers and dataset makers. The government must listen more to AI specialists and the affected people, instead of listening only to businessman. The debate must be diverse!
