As described above, generative AI systems have the ability to produce material that would be copyrightable if it were created by a human author. What are your views on the potential benefits and risks of this technology? How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, technology developers, researchers, and the public?<br/><br/>My personal view on generative AI systems is that it could be a huge benefit to individuals (humans)&hellip;..artists, authors, etc., in that long hours of research may take less time than before generative AI because the research generative AI produces by way of human interaction via prompts are generally faster and yield results that the researcher may not have thought about, and with a little bit of fact checking on the researcher&rsquo;s part, this could be highly useful and less stressful to that human researcher. Could this affect creators/artists/copyright owners yes it could, by the potential loss of their copyright(s), but I don&rsquo;t think I agree with the use of AI as valid reason to discredit or rescind an author&rsquo;s copyright. Without human interaction, generative AI is still only a tool awaiting a concept or prompt from a human individual. As of today, October 8, 2023, this commenter doesn&rsquo;t believe that AI can generate material on its own without human intervention so unless or until AI can do that, which would open another bigger Pandora&rsquo;s box, I personally don&rsquo;t feel that Copyright laws should be amended. They do work as they are written and by court proceedings&hellip;..called precedent. <br/>
