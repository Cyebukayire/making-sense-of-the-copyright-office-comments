I am concerned about the current state of affairs regarding AI and the danger it poses towards the livelihoods of people in creative industries. Without regulations to protect us, AI may be able to permanently destroy one&#39;s ability to write, draw, compose, animate, model, photograph or design FOR A LIVING. AI currently scours databases and uses our creative works in order to train itself, without our knowledge or consent. While I can see AI being used as a helpful tool in some situations, it is becoming clearer and clearer that the people who are predominantly interested in using AI have no compunctions about using it to replace human artists entirely, so long as the corporation paying for new media can save costs. I believe that the situation will only worsen if regulations are not put into place.
