As an artist, one of my biggest concerns with AI is using copyrighted work to develop these AI models.  If my work is being used, and it is infringing on copyright laws, then I think that there is a big issue in regards to the relationship with AI and copyright.  If copyrighted work is being used to develop these AI models, then I think that the original authors of the copyrighted work should be compensated or made aware if their work has already been used with developing the AI models that are already existing. Overall, I think that AI is a potential liability in regards to infringing on artists copyright laws and rights.
