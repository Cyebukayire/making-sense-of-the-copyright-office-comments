With regard to General Questions 15-17 &ndash; Transparency and Recordkeeping, I advocate that the developers of AI models and creators of training datasets &ldquo;be required to collect, retain, and disclose records regarding the materials used to train their models.&rdquo;  As they are receiving the benefit of the work of those human authors who created (wrote) the works used, or compiled the data, they need to, at minimum, keep track of what works they used.  If these are commercial entities, there should be regulations developed as to the content, where obtained, and copyright status.  This system could be maintained by the U.S. Copyright Office as a database that commercial entities must report the content used by the generative AI that they go on to sell in order to make money from.<br/>The cost of this recordkeeping system should be borne by the commercial entities who sell the training products.<br/>Copyright holders whose materials are used should be notified anytime their works are used to train an AI model.  There should be an absolute requirement that the entities must do so within a specified time period.  Copyright holders should also be able to deny the right of an entity to use their works without remuneration.  If they cannot come to an agreement (such as licensing the work for a particular use) then the copyright holder should be able to seek injunctive relief and monetary damages if the entity proceeds to use it.<br/>
