I am an individual who both works and creates art using artificial intelligence. In my day job, I spend time through a fortune 500 company that uses humans + AI documentation to help process thousands of documents weekly and think this combination is a way for humans to advance, and lessen the burden of workload while maintaining productivity. It&#39;s great, but it needs restrictions to ensure the job is not entirely given away to automation - and also ensure safety for all involved. This has given me a unique perspective when it comes to using AI and copyright. Ultimately, while the AI may generate something, it takes quality and time to either 1) develop the inputs necessary to get the desired result 2) require followup after to further ensure accuracy. <br/>I also enjoy using Midjourney AI to create art. I urge those reading to grant copyright to individual artists that utilize AI tools. I understand it requires human input to grant copyright, and in prior cases someone used this tool to develop an art book that was granted copyright and later repealed. With that much effort and transformation, it is not just automation. Prohibiting copyright actively harms artists that are pushing boundaries of technology and art. Consider that it does require human input to develop commands or further generate the art/content. It is a tool. Blocking copyright discourages actual artists from uploading. I&#39;m also a watercolor artist and I like running my own art through the generator, and then working with the output, and then painting that. But uploading my content puts me in the unique position of putting my art on the database and having no protections despite it being 1) my original visual input/art 2) my commands but not able to &quot;claim ownership&quot;.
