AI image generators shouldn&#39;t be able to use copyrighted works to train their systems. This is an undeniable case of copyright infringement. AI image generators such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DreamUp use millions of copyrighted images from the database LAION-5B to train their AI generators. Lawyer Matthew Butterick serves as co-counsel on a class-action lawsuit against many AI generators, such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT, for copyright infringement. According to Butterick in an article for The New Yorker, the issue with these AI generators using copyrighted art to train their models is that these artists have not consented to the use of their copyrighted art, they have not been compensated or credited for the use of their copyrighted artwork in training these AI models. There have been other lawsuits against AI generators, including a lawsuit by Getty Images against Stable Diffusion for copyright infringement. The U.S. Copyright Office should consider these lawsuits when making decisions on AI generators using copyrighted material to train their models. It isn&#39;t fair to artists unable to opt out of their art being used without their permission and without credit or compensation. The use of copyrighted images to train AI image generators should only be allowed on an opt-in basis.
