When it comes to AI and copyright I don&rsquo;t believe that AI created images, texts, music, etc. should be copyrightable for a myriad of reasons. We know from copyright law that in order for a work to be copyrightable it has to be tangible, be original, be created by someone either in the US or of US nationality, and most importantly it has to be a work of authorship. Now the term authorship has been disputed a lot, but the office has explicitly stated that authorship means that the work has to have been created by a human, not an animal, not ai, a human. In the case of Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony it was argued that due to the fact that a camera took the pictures that were copied, the work itself was not copyrightable. The court then said that since a human being was operating the camera, that person was the author of the picture meaning the picture was in fact copyrightable. Much like with this case when it comes to works created by AI the works themselves are not copyrightable because they don&rsquo;t have authorship, they aren&rsquo;t created by humans. Now if a human were to edit the works created by said AI only then should the works be copyrightable because human intervention has happened. In that case, the whole works also shouldn&rsquo;t fully be copyrightable, only the edits made by the human should be copyrightable. I know that in theory humans have to prompt the AI to create the music, or the drawing, but the human being themselves did not create the work, they only prompted something to make it for them. I should not be able to type two words into an AI and be able to copyright the beautiful picture that it created for me because I was not the one that made it.
