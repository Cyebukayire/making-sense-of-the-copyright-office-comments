In consideration of questions 1 and 18 of the Office notice: given that the ALA argues in &quot;Library Copyright Alliance Principles for Copyright and Artificial Intelligence&quot; that traditional principles of human authorship can be attributed to a generative AI user &quot;sufficiently controlling the AI such that the resulting work as a whole constituted an original work of human authorship,&quot; the Office should be open to reconsideration of its position that AI generated work, especially visual work when part of a multimodal genre, is noncopyrightable. Applying the ALA&#39;s insight to cases like the Zarya of the Dawn registration attempt, we can see that there may be space for recognizing careful, deliberate, creative use of prompts to compose in multimodal genres as displaying the necessary spark of creativity and modicum of originality to potentially qualify for copyright protection; the reasonably anticipatable alternative is that such creative works will be disincentivized for authors who might be able to compose fully in such multimodal genres as the comic book only with the assistance of generative AI tools for visual matter. In my practice as a literacy educator, as recently as last week I encountered a student fully capable of composing the textual portions of a comic book, in fact they had composed the equivalent of many comic book issues, yet composing the visual aspects of the genre text represented a substantial burden for them. While they could use tools like Midjourney to creatively compose material through carefully engineered prompts and a series of refinements to complete such projects (or even just to prototype them for a later, clearly human visual artist), they and others like them are actively disincentivized from making use of such otherwise productive tools for expressive material because of the current noncopyrightable nature of such work. The Office should reconsider that Prompt Engineering might offer a way of recognizing the inherent human contribution to such generative AI products. The Office has argued that there is an unpredictable nature to tools like Midjourney that challenges the copyrightable stance of their products; however, the unpredictable nature is the result of a lack of understanding on behalf of the user, and this in and of itself does not mean that the system is completely random. If a photographer is surprised by the way their photo turns out in an unanticipated way, this does not challenge the copyrightablity of the photo. As the Cambridge Handbook on AI argues, the human hand ultimately guides the process of generative AI usage, regardless of the sophistication of the tools.
