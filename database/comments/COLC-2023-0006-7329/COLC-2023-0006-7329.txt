(1) If the companies that are creating/training AI use copyrighted works in the creation or training of AI models, then they need to be both crediting the author of the copyrighted work as well as compensating them in some way, since they are benefiting from the use of these works.<br/>(2) Material generated by AI should NOT be protected under copyright. It was not created by human authors, and is in fact merely &quot;trained&quot; to regurgitate the work of human authors without crediting them.  (3) The materials generated by AI systems should be liable for infringement of copyrighted works. They are being trained using copyrighted works, and are capable of searching the internet for, and duplicating copyrighted works, in ways that would be infringement if done by a human author. (4) AI works that imitate the identity or style of a human author should be considered infringement on that author&#39;s work if that work is protected under copyright. However, if the human author&#39;s work is in the public domain then it would not infringe on copyright.    <br/>
