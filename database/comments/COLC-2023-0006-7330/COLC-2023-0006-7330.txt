The use of Artificial Intelligence is creating both new opportunities and new challenges within the world, and especially within the realm of copyright. When addressing the use of artificial intelligence, many considerations must be taken into account, as our office noted in their call for comment, especially within two realms as I see it: 1) the use of copyrighted works to train AI models AND 2) the copyrightability of material generated using AI systems. Both of these items are important as they help provide the initial bases from which AI can work as well as if the results of the AI itself is a form of copyrightable material.<br/>When looking at the use of copyrighted material that serves as the basis for artificial intelligence to work from, this presents a few potential issues in terms of copyright- both from the source material and how it is used by artificial intelligence. While there is precedent, outside of artificial intelligence, for using material as the inspiration of other works, often this is done within certain constraints, such as making substant enough changes to the source material to make it a new work. Also, copyright holders, as having that copyright and filing it with your office are afforded certain protections and rights, one of which is the right to create derivative works based of their original work. Artificial intelligence is only as good as the base material it is working from and using to create an algorithm, and as such, it does not know if works are copyrighted or not unless it is programmed in. This means generative AI works could violate existing copyright as the individual providing the source material or mining the information may not realize it and thus give the AI materials or items as sources that are not allowed or would need permissions to use in creating new material. One of the major exceptions of this is the use of parody, which is allowed within copyright, however, a great majority of content created within AI is not parody in nature but rather in a similar style or inspired from, which would not seemingly protect it from copyright infringement.<br/>In addition, a question is also raised about if the material created from AI is even able to be copyrighted as, in order to obtain a copyright, the material must be created from a human author. As stated in your Regulations Document, human authors may help program the AI, decide the base source material, and set overall parameters, and that the use of a computer itself does not rule out copyright consideration much in the way using a typewriter to produce a manuscript does not rule out the copyright of the material(s) produced. However, in this example, I would argue that the author is still in control of the process and actively changing the material produced by hitting the keys and affecting the overall content while AI is in fact creating the material it is producing even though parameters were set by a human. In the latter case, it would be like a patron asking an artist to make an item with certain conditions- while the patron had a hand in the process and directed its content, the artist is the one actively crafting the result and thus should own the copyright of the creation/image. While a human composes the base material possibly to draw from and sets parameters, they do not actively make the image that results and instead is the computer acts as more than just a tool and instead becomes the creator of the image and since not human under the guidelines, is not able to have the work copyrighted those results.<br/>
