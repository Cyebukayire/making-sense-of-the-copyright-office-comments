A logic-drenched ode to defending America&#39;s supposed principles<br/><br/>Copyright has always been and always will be about control and nothing else. Creativity flourished before Copyright existed and it undoubtedly will again once we collectively come to our senses and it&rsquo;s justifiably abandoned. Hopefully the proliferation of AI generated art will help lead humanity towards the far more beneficial direction of restriction-free creativity.<br/><br/>Besides, I incessantly hear about how the mighty Free Market, especially when unhindered by Government interference, through the gloriously efficient wonders of competition, can magically solve any and all of humanity&rsquo;s issues on its own. And I currently can&rsquo;t imagine, even with the incentivized benefits of Copyright, anything more antithetical to that than Government-protected monopolies.
