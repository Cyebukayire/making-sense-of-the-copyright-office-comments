I only have a few things to say. Namely, to refer to this technology as artificial intelligence is misinformation. An artifical intelligence would be one created and indistinguishable from a human, with its own thoughts, opinions, and feelings. These programs are developed to scan data and mimic it. It&#39;s plagiarism software that steals art, concepts, information, and styles from folks who work hard to create what they do. Not to mention these &quot;AI&quot; programs are being advertised to children to write essays and do homework for them. If this technology is to be used, it should never be allowed to do things like write books, create art, develop film or tv scripts, or replicate any human image or their voice.
