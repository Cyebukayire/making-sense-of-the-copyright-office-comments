Precedent has stated that non-human creation of works, such as programmatic generation from a computer or accidental creation by an animal, are not copyrighted. That makes sense.<br/><br/>It should be noted that generative AI content is not created in a vacuum. There is some code or even a prompt which must be hand-written to get the output. This creates some vaguery over more complex ideas like intellectual property.<br/><br/>If a human types a request for a specific cartoon character, they would own the prompt for the character but not the trademark of the character. Yet if they draw a ribbon on the character, do they have copyright over the composite or just the ribbon? I don&#39;t know. There should be some opportunity for creative transformations of AI output to make it copyrightable.<br/><br/>Using publicly available content for training should be addressed. Converting a drawing online into a series of weights is abstract but does feel a bit like transforming the original source in a way that the original creator does not like. When these AI models are made available commercially using unpaid creator sources, it feels like copyright infringement even if the law doesn&#39;t quite capture that right now. But I don&#39;t think it would be infringement if the images are trained on an object classifier algorithm.<br/><br/>It is clear that AI content will continue to grow as an industry and there&#39;s a lot of good opportunities there for more accessible kinds of content. But there should be clear labels and metadata within the files in order to give the viewer a full provenance.
