Generative AI in its current form is not a tool for creating original works, but rather one that disassembles and plagiarizes copyrighted works in part or whole for the profit of the generative AI company and their customers. Copyrighted works are laundered by the software without permission from or compensation to the creators from whose labor the software developers profit.<br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>No copyrighted or copyrightable works should be allowed in training data sets without the express permission of and/or compensation paid to the copyright holder.<br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>No works created by generative AI should be copyrightable.<br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Any companies distributing software that is used to create copyrightable works (EG: art or word processing software) should be required by law to provide clear and obvious disclosures if their terms of service agreements grant them permission to use copyrighted works for generative AI training/data sets.
