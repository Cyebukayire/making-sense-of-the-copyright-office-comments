The term &quot;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE&quot; is a misnomer. The amalgamation of algorithms collating information from all corners from the internet does not create intelligence. It is merely extrapolating information that it has been programmed to collect. There is nothing &quot;intelligent&quot; in its&#39; programming.<br/><br/>Now that AI has proliferated the world without any implemented regulation, the &quot;bad players&quot; are stealing the intellectual rights of artists like myself. Words, lyrics, concepts, music, art, everything is stolen without any compensation to the artist that the algorithm has taken from.<br/>My catalogue is my livelihood. It is hard enough that lawmakers stalled in the early days to recognize the issue with property rights  and copy rights in the internet age. The US government allowed businessmen to determine the value of music/art, and they decided to pay virtually nothing! 0.0001 is what companies pay artists from streaming the music the artist has created. That is not a living wage! Leave it to the businessman, they will pay nothing, and that they do. Capitalism at work screwing the working man as always.<br/><br/>As AI continues to become more powerful, artists rights must be defended. Make the billionaires pay the artist from which they have built their empire upon. This is indentured servitude in the 21st century. It can be easily determined how a programmer created a piece of writing, music, or art  from the program itself. If my name were to be used as a prompt to create a new piece, I SHOULD BE COMPENSATED as such.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all I see in the future is the US Government bending a knee to the billionaires, once again, to placate the money that is supporting their re-election campaigns.<br/><br/>A democracy based on capitalism only supports the wealthy. Capitalism does not serve the working man. Anything that supports workers rights is considered socialism, and that term has been deemed the bogeyman.<br/>
