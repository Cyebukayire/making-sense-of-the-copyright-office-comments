AI hurts artists and businesses producing Intellectual Property alike. The implicitly aggressive opt-in mechanic of generative AI is extremely backwards and can hardly be considered transformative especially in the case of how accessible it is to copy an artist&#39;s style, linework, and coloring methods. Lots of the outputs also commonly include the Shutterstock watermark which significantly hurts the stock-photo business model by severing their customer base. <br/><br/>If generative AI becomes a standard business practice, the job economy for creatives and artists alike become jeopardized and thousands of years of human&#39;s communicating via art becomes invalidated. Traditional art to most people. especially those living in small spaces, is inaccessible and expensive which will create a constant resistance of the form coming back as an alternative against generative AI. I also implore that the reader of this comment spends some time to explore how Google Image search has changed substantially to contain less useful information due to the rapid expansion and accessibility of generative AI techology to the common persons. <br/><br/>The use of generative AI to specifically use the styles of other artists is particularly becoming rampant in artist alleys at various conventions like Anime Expo or Comic Con. Several artists I&#39;ve talked to view this practice as unfavorable, unfair, and in poor-spirit of the philosophy that&#39;s been used to curate the culture that&#39;s been present there for several decades.<br/><br/>Assistive generative AI, however, I am in favor of. In the film &quot;Klaus&quot; featured on Netflix, the animators used generative AI to assist with color-grading and gradient matching for a beautiful consistency in the hand drawn nature of the film. Lots of tools like iZotope Ozone, an audio mastering plugin, use AI to help engineers save time by referencing the tone of a similar track in an album a song is in to make a whole album have proficient consistency and saving both the artist and engineer a lot of valuable time. There&#39;s a lot of nuance to consider with generative AI, but personally I see that a lot of people use a useful tool for genuine theft by implementing a loophole where copyright law simply doesn&#39;t cover. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read this. Sincerely, a professional musician and artist.
