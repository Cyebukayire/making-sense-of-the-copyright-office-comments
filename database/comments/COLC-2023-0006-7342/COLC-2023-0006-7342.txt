I believe that authors, artists, and academics should be compensated for all their work that&rsquo;s used in training AI models. I think that corporations are profiting off their work and it&rsquo;s crucial for the copyright office to protect their rights. Training AI is not the same as other uses for fair use (aka educational or academic) because it&rsquo;s for pure profit and makes it easier for others to copy. Please protect the rights of artists and academics everywhere
