Hello, my name is Malcolm Alonzo and I am from New Mexico.  I would like to submit the following in response to your request for comment regarding Artifical Intelligence and Copyright.  Specifically I submit the following regarding your questions 1 and 3:<br/><br/>My view is that generative AI systems are simply tools that have been developed using emerging technology.  Technology has evolved for use and as a tool, is not inherently good or bad.  Man has used previously produced writings, art and other cultural expressions to create or present new and/or modified ideas since time immemorial.  Ecclesiastes 1:9 tells us &ldquo;there is nothing new under the sun.&rdquo; As such, works created by AI are simply created from previously produced works and like a collage, are simply rearranged patterns of verbs, nouns, pronouns, adjectives and other parts of speech.  I agree with the Library Copyright Alliance&rsquo;s &ldquo;Principle for Copyright and Artificial Intelligence&rdquo; located at: https://www.librarycopyrightalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/AI-principles.pdf. They assert that the existing U.S. Copyright Act is fully capable to address any issues raised by the intersection of AI and copyright.<br/>The basic premise is that if AI creates any work that is substantially similar to a preexisting protected work, then the AI infringes on the copyright of the original work.  If traditional principles are applied to the work created by AI, and there is enough effort introduced to the process by human hands, then the new work constitutes an original work of human authorship.  <br/>I reiterate that AI is simply a tool that speeds up traditional processes of recycling themes, plot lines, and other elements of human literary expression and can and does allow for new ways of expression in a much more efficient way.  This, I feel, is the hallmark and purpose of the copyright system. <br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment. <br/>
