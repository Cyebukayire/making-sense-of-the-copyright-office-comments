I believe AI Art as a whole is highly unethical as the only way for it to be made is to take art from other hard-working artists and mash it together based on a prompt. Nothing about it is ethical, and as an artist myself, I urge you to listen to what is in the best interests of me and many other artists worldwide. AI art cannot replicate the thoughts and feelings that go into Art in its many forms. AI art cannot feel the pain and anguish that comes with struggling to get art to look and sound the way we want it to. AI art cannot feel the pure joy we artists feel when we finally get our work the way we envisioned it. It cannot feel those experiences, and therefore, it has to make &quot;art&quot; by taking the hard work of others, by taking the love and effort put into artworks to try and create what, in the end, is simply nothing more than an empty husk that is meant to be called &quot;art.&quot; Please, from the bottom of my heart, crack down on AI art so that artists like me can create to our full potential without having to worry about our works being taken by an AI.
