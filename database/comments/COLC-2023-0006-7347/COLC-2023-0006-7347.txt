AI, both generative and non-generative, is inherently unethical - trained on artists&rsquo;, writers&rsquo; and photographers&rsquo; work almost entirely without their consent or even knowledge, cobbling and scraping huge bodies of work. Many AI programs and advocates specifically tout its usage as a &ldquo;copyright dodger&rdquo; - a way to get an artist&rsquo;s or company&rsquo;s work without crediting or paying them for it. AI becoming a prevalent tool for creation means we&rsquo;ve ceded the best and most fulfilling parts of life to machines, and to the people who operate them who could have commissioned or contracted an artist or writer, but who instead make an algorithm steal from them. Why should I want to read what nobody could be bothered to write? These can and will lose big businesses, small companies, and independent/freelance workers their whole business. It also spreads disinformation wildly and is a vehicle for fraud. An unverifiable, ever-growing, unworthwhile Frankenstein aping real people out of their intellectual property.
