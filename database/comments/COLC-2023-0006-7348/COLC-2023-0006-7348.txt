As a parent, my primary concern with AI is ensuring nothing of mine can be used in in AI training without my express permission. There should be significant penalties for using someone&#39;s personal photos or writing in AI training without their permission to discourage this from ever happening. Nothing should be used to train AI without the the original poster opting in and giving their consent. Period. <br/><br/>As an author and playwright, I would be looking for works made with AI to be treated exactly the same as any other derivative work. Namely that they a) cannot be included in AI training or any resulting AI creation without the express permission of the creator and b) this inclusion comes with the conditional that the creator will be compensated for their work (either with flat fee or a percentage of any profits resulted from the use of their content decided upon by both parties).<br/><br/>This is no different than how it would work if you sampled a song or did an adaptation of another copyrighted work and that is exactly how AI should work.<br/><br/>To reiterate: Whether personal or commercial, we are looking for legislation that says content can ONLY be used in AI training and resulting creations with the express permission of the rights holder AND they are to be compensated for the inclusion.
