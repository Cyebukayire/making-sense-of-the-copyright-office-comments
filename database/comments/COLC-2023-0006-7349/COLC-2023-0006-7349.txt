Our organization completed a review on AI and its responses (ChatGPT specifically). We have concluded that the information provided is either diluted, misleading, missing pertinent information, adding misinformation, or bias. Therefore, we have submitted detailed information to ChatGPT with factual research-backed references. It did update the submission with the information from our textbook with our institutional reference. HOW would this apply to our future copyrights if they have our information listed within their system??? NOTE: We did copyright the information first.<br/><br/>Dr. Gloria C.
