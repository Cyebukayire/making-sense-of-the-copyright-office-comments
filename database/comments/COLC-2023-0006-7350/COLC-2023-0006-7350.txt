As an author, I have copyright over my works. Period. Derivative works require my permission to use my materials in their work. Whether for personal or monetary gain. <br/><br/>I have spent over twenty years and thousands of hours learning how to write. To have AI jump in and use all of that effort and time I&#39;ve put in, without my consent, is appalling. I am a living author, not someone long dead whose work is in the creative commons. I need to be able to afford to live and so do my fellow authors.<br/><br/>Much of the copy you read in business platforms was created by authors like me, using their skills to fill a gap in the business field. Advertisements, instructions, and texts on everyday items are necessary for communication and understanding in our country. Your speech writers, if you have them, spent thousands of hours learning how to write. This is not a job anyone can do. Something so influential on the daily level should not be left to a base algorithm that only learns from the past and cannot look toward the future. <br/><br/>There are children reading books right now who gain a love for writing. My niece has expressed the desire to become a writer. It is already a difficult field to work in. Difficult to maintain during the buildup of a portfolio, and even more difficult to make a living from. Adding AI that uses an author&#39;s works without their consent adds many difficulties to an already difficult profession. Already magazines and platforms like Amazon have been inundated with thousands of AI submissions, many of them unedited, further saturating the market and making it even more difficult for living authors.<br/><br/>To make myself clear: AI algorithms should not be trained on anyone&#39;s work without their consent. That is what the creative commons is for, isn&#39;t it? So that there can be a large body of historical work for authors and artists to pull from? Let the companies that develop these algorithms use the creative commons, or ask permission of living authors and compensate living authors for their work.
