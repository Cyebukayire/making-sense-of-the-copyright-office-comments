As an artist and writer my main concerns surrounding AI are those of copywrite and compensation.<br/><br/>While I do not necessarily take issue with AI reading and harvesting from my work, I do take issue that a) sources are not cited b) sources are not compensated for their work c) sources do not know when their work is being harvested d) sources do not know - or at least I and my colleagues don&#39;t - know how to stop our work from being pirated or harvested.<br/><br/>Consent is key.<br/><br/>I look forward to regulation that puts the control of artistic content into the hands of the artists, not in the hands of AI and their parent corporations.
