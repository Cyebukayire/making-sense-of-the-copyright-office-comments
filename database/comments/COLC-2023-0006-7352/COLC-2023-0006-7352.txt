I do not agree with question 1, as due to the nature of how AI functions it is literally incapable of making copyrightable material in the same sense an artist or author might. Humans are influenced by others but that influence is still warped by the individual creative&rsquo;s life and experiences, memory, and skill level. AI cannot be influenced in that same way. The internet already suffers from excessive copyright infringement due to the nature of material being accessible, but before now it was usually easy to spot and put a stop to. Now it is far harder. Art is my chosen career path, I&rsquo;ve been putting time and energy into this and I make my living by selling my art. Someone might choose my art over another&rsquo;s because they like specifically how it looks, and that&rsquo;s how I find work.<br/><br/>Someone could now put all my art into a machine and tell it to &ldquo;draw&rdquo; something just like my art, and suddenly what do I have to sell anymore? Imagine you show someone several drawings of a dog you made and you ask them &ldquo;do you want me to draw you a dog? I could do it for $5!&rdquo; And they say &ldquo;no, that&rsquo;s alright!&rdquo; Then they proceed to take scissors, cut up your drawings, glue them together in a &ldquo;new&rdquo; way, then turned around and sold that for $5. You didn&rsquo;t give them permission to do that, not only have they chopped up your work to mesh it together, they then took $5 you could have earned by drawing that third party a dog. Suddenly no one wants to buy your dog drawings because it&rsquo;s so much faster to just glue together your old drawings, and cheaper too! This is specifically an artist&rsquo;s point of view, but I&rsquo;ve heard even worse horror stories from the writing end.<br/><br/>People are being hired to write to train these AIs, with the explicit confirmation that &ldquo;as soon as that AI can write as good as you, you&rsquo;re fired.&rdquo; Traditional authors have been hit hard but so have those who write copies for advertisements and blurbs for websites, those whose careers are based on journalism (especially online). Your words and work can not only be used to replace you, but it can be used to produce works in your name/style that you would never. It&rsquo;s all the deceit of a forgery with none of the actual skill required to make a skilled one.   <br/><br/>I wish I was more knowledgeable on all the technical aspects of things, but the proof of models using things such as specific artists work and stock images can be seen in the numerous examples where the AI model attempts to recreate watermarks. Hopefully others have articulated these points in ways that are more technical and full of the proof needed to make them clearer. I love being an artist, and I want to continue working in this industry. But I also want to be able to eat and not live in an anxious bubble waiting for when my employers decide it&rsquo;s cheaper just to have the machine glue my dog art together.
