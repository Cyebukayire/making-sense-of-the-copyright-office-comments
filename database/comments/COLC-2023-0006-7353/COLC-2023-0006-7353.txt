As a content creator, I have concerns over my works, which are freely available over the Internet, being potentially used in a for-profit manner either directly via AI training, or indirectly via an AI-created derivative work being sold, either without my consent or knowledge, and without me receiving proper credit (including any royalties). Copyright law must be extended to include such uses, ensuring that original creators are given credit for, and a share of any profits made from, their works. There must also be a system of redress, where even creators with limited resources can seek and receive such credit and/or profit if they are not in good faith provided beforehand. <br/><br/>This is not only an issue of profitability and credit; it is also an issue of creative minds potentially being stifled due to fear of their work being essentially stolen from them by entities with deep pockets, expensive legal teams, and the ability to use the media as a bully pulpit to silence them. Human society has thrived on the creativity of millions of writers, artists, and many other talented individuals. Subverting this by making creative works an exclusively for-profit, AI-driven field would bring to an end the growth of our society by individuals, instead putting the future of humanity dependent on corporate-owned machines. <br/><br/>Machines may be able to do many jobs more efficiently than human beings, but they can never, and should never, replace humans in the fields of literature, art, and the other creative sciences. Please consider this as you determine how AI will be regulated, and how humanity will be protected from its potential over-proliferation. Thank you for your time and your consideration.
