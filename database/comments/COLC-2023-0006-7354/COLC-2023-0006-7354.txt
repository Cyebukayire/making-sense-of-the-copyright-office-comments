The concept of intellectual property, including &quot;copyright&quot;, was created as a legal reward and incentive for creative people to exercise and share their creativity. Generative AI is not and cannot be a person, is not and cannot be creative, and further requires no reward or incentive to carry out its automated function. <br/><br/>Nearly all of the current commercially-available generative AI models are built on copyrighted work created by actual humans and stolen/harvested without permission, payment, or even recognition. Rewarding this practice undermines the value of existing copyrights of all creative people, living or dead.<br/><br/>Generative AI is an existential threat to creative employment, because the generated files are produced so quickly and (in the current commercial landscape so cheaply) that they are an irresistible lure for profit-focused corporations who desire cheap and quick results above all else. At the moment, this is especially true for imitations of specific famous artists, writers, or performers that may be difficult to distinguish from actual creations of those creative people. In the future, it may not be possible for a person to support themselves creatively or even become publicly well-known because any interesting facet of a published work will immediately be imitated, exaggerated, and incorporated in an endless cascade of AI-generated files beyond the possible output of any single human. In this way it is fundamentally opposed to copyright&#39;s aim of supporting creative people. <br/><br/>While recognizing the practical difficulty of &quot;detecting&quot; AI-generated works, in principle no AI-generated works should be awarded copyright protection.
