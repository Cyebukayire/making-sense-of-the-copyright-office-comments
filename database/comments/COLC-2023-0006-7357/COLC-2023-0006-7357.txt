When any work is copy righted it should never be used by someone in any way without permission.  I find this particularly egregious because people are PROFITING off of someone else&#39;s creativity.  Music is another way that people are profiting off of someone else&#39;s creativity, and not asking permission.  If an individual has followed the steps to protect their creation no one should be violating that for any reason.  When they also profit from it, that is stealing.
