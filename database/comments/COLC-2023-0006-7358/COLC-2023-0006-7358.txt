This is specifically about &quot;Generative AI&quot; (GAI).<br/><br/>GAI as it stands now, were built on mass theft, be it of produced works, labor, or wage. GAI is built by mining billions of inputs of the internet, with most of them considered private, copyrighted, or in general unconsented. Without this inputs, current model of GAI would not be possible, hence making them 100% reliant on said inputs. In other words, the works and labors of their mining victims are what to be considered the backbone of GAI, thus making these victims equally rightful to be considered as contributors. Policy must establish the rights of the originators of these inputs, and these rights must be enforced.<br/><br/>Furthermore, GAI works by, in a simple term, &quot;remixing&quot; these inputs; which further implicates the problem of using copyrighted and private data. Simply put, GAI are trained to &ldquo;regenerate the original data&rdquo;. They are an Autoencoder in which the entire purpose is to output the inputs themselves. They are trained by 1) taking an input, 2) encode said inputs, and then 3) decodes them to regenerate the original input. A process of reverse engineering, you might say.<br/><br/>This poses a huge problem, especially since the leading companies that owns the most popular GAIs are either for-profit or profitable, much more than the victims they mined from. As we all know, for TDM, the exceptions to mine non-public data only applies to scientific research purposes, while also having a lawful access to the data; as reflected on EU DSM Directive as well as German Article. For profit research organizations or non-profits whose management is influenced by a private entity will in principle not benefit from the TDM exception.<br/><br/>Another problem is, GAI that ingested copyrighted works have minimal to no purposes aside from competing with the victims they mined from in the same market, they have no use for curing cancer or advancing scientific researches, and so far the only use they have aside from competing with their mined victims for examples are to introduce societal biases, misinformation, and the worst of all: child pornography.<br/><br/>Moreover, in regards of GAI competing with its mined victims in the same market, with some companies already outsourcing their needs to GAI, it is not long until GAI will fully compete with all human contributors it mined from. With said competition, GAI may negatively affect the value of the very copyrighted works on which it mined, further weakening their position should they want to claim fair use for their defense.<br/><br/>So far, this means GAI have these possible charges: unjust enrichment, unfair competition, illegal data mining, copyright infringement, and illicit reverse engineering. Additionally, there are still other essential challenges of GAI that needs to be addressed if public trust in GAI and governance is to be secured, such as: societal biases, privacy challenge, misrepresentation and misinformation challenge, data access monopoly, black box challenge, liability challenge, employment challenge, IP and copyright challenge, and existential challenge.<br/><br/>In conclusion: GAI is built on mass theft and works produced by GAI should not be granted copyright. In addition, policy must establish the rights of the contributors (victims whose works mined by GAI), and these rights must be enforced. Lastly, every other challenges and risks posed by GAI needs to be addressed.
