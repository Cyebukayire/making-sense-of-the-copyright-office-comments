The issue regarding AI generated &quot;Art&quot; is extremelly important for me as a disabled artist. If I and many other artists struggle to scrap by making art that takes days and months to create. It will feel like a slap to the face if a computer can sample our art for someone else to use for profit and success. Someone making &quot;AI art&quot; should not be allowed to profitt of of it as it is not made by them, only by the computer with 10% assisstance by a human plotting in prompts. The computer lacks the imagination, it steals art from other artists to create what the AI prompter has in mind. Ignoring the non consent from Artists to do so. This has been further proven by AIs continuously adding a scribble as a signature field that is a mix of many other artists signatures. This will also harm other real artists financially as when someone can replicate anything via AI, buying art from an actuall artist will not be on their minds. Humans often take the easier approach. I hope that something will be done to prevent the thievery of art in the future.
