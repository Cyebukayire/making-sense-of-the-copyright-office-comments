Hello.  I am a traditional and digitsl artist who has been honing my craft for 20 years.  The emergence of AI art is devastating and devalues my own work, making it difficult for me to sell my art.   AI art as a phenomena will degrade th&egrave; culture brought by artists to the larger community.  This is actively harmful to the community.
