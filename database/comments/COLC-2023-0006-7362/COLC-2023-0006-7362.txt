I find AI to be extremely concerning as an artist. Our work has been used to train AI without consent, credit, or compensation to us. This technology could not exist without the work of artists. It creates images by blending together millions of images created by artists. All of this is copyrighted work that has been used to train AI. The AI uses this work to create new images, but these new images could not exist without the work of millions of artist that the technology has been trained on without permission from creators of said work. This is already effecting artists livelihoods and will continue to do so if not regulated.
