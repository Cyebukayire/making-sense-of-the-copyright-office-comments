As a creator, I worry deeply about the ways generative models and artificial intelligence will effect creative occupations that already stuggle so deeply. In the US, is already so difficult to make a living in a creative pursuit that it may as well be impossible. I do also recognize the potential that these softwares and programs hold. With that, we have also seen the inability of our countries leadership to comprehend more accessible forms of technology such as the Internet and social media. Because of the repeated failures to intelligently legislate emerging technologies, it is very apparent that the necessary guidelines for artificial intelligence must be written with the consultation of industry experts.
