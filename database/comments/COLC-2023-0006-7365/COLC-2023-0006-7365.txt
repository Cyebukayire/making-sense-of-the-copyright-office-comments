I absolutely detest the notion of using peoples works, with out their knowledge and consent, in any manner of training for AI. I believe that, should AI owners/developers want to use any sort of creative work to train their AI&#39;s, they need to ask the creator/owners permission, as well as gain their legal consent through a contract, and reimburse the creator/owner as much as any buyer would have to in order to purchase rights/temporary rights to the creative works. As a member of numerous targeted/discussed sites/organizations, including the OTW, Archive of Our Own, Wattpad, Fanfiction.net, etc. If I were to find out that any part of or any work of mine had been used, without my knowledge or consent, in order to train any form of AI, I would be sorely tempted to file a single or even a class action lawsuit against whichever company had used it. That being said, I do understand that fannish works are public material under fair-use copyright laws, and they do not belong to the creators but to whoever created the original material, and we, as the fans, are following fair-use laws and have no LEGAL claim to our works. However, whether or not we own the material, we still spend time and energy working on it, and it would still be the proper thing to do to ask our permission before using our works.<br/><br/>On the issue of copyrighting AI works, they can&#39;t be copyrightable, but must give all necessary credit to all persons whose work(s) was/were used to train or inspire the AI or developer/company to create the piece.<br/><br/>As for infringement rules, liability goes to the AI company/developer whose AI created it. Seeing as they used other people&#39;s works to generate the end result. If, however, they had permission from the creator to use the works, there is no liability whatsoever, seeing as all parties consented to the use and generation of the end piece.
