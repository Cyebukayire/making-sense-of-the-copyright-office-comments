As an artist who occasionally shares their work on the internet I personally believe that any procedurally generated &ldquo;AI&rdquo; images, audio, or video content should at the bare minimum display sources for what specific content was used to create the resulting piece. I also believe that any &ldquo;AI&rdquo; program should not be able to utilize existing work for training that the original creator of has not explicitly given it the right to use. I have never and will never give any computer program the authority to use photographs of me, my voice, or my art as resources to create something new, however with the current lack of regulation for this technology, I find myself hesitant to share anything online anymore. Artists deserve full rights and credit to their original works and &ldquo;AI art&rdquo; generators have made it extremely difficult to safeguard against art theft.
