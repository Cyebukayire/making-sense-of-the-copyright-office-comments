Artificial Intelligence algorithms require inputs to train on. If the inputs used are from copyrighted material, used without consent, then any outputs of the algorithm need to indicate that, should not be used for any purpose outside of fair use laws (commentary, research etc...) and should not be copyrightable in their own right.  Including AI generated art, music, software, prose, or other works into a larger body may not remove the ability to copyright the whole work... but should be limited to those same rules as apply to fair use limitations of including copyrighted works without permission.
