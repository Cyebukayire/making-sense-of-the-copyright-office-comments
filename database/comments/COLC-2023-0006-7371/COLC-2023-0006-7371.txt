Upgrade Title 17, &lsquo;All rights reserved.&rsquo; to contain new right to &lsquo;opt out&rsquo; from ML training<br/><br/>Purpose: If you don&rsquo;t want your original authored work used in unsolicited training of other&#39;s machine learning models, then you are in support of having a new copyright right. The copyright designation already allows for &#39;All rights reserved.&#39; New copyright rights, should include the &lsquo;right to opt out&rsquo; of having one&rsquo;s book, photograph, music&mdash; used in the training of a ML / AI model. The legal authority to create a new right and the necessary copyright registration workflow begins with contacting our US Representatives and having a US Representative support and draft legislation to change Title 17 or consumer protection laws at the Federal level. You can find your US Representative at https://www.congress.gov and write to him or her requesting Title 17 be upgraded putting into law a new right to &lsquo;opt out&rsquo; of having one&rsquo;s copy written work used to train other corporations ML models. <br/><br/>All original authors and copyright holders should have the right to choose whether or not a corporation or individual uses their work as part of a machine learning model training process. A LLM and associated software application cannot discourse &#39;intelligently&#39; about Harry Potter&rsquo;s characters, arc or story and story attributes if the ML model was not trained on the story content- either web scraped or trained directly from book content. Authors should have Title 17 legal right and e-co registration workflow capability to &lsquo;just say no to ML training&rsquo;- being able to &lsquo;opt out&rsquo; of essentially being forced outside of the licensing and royalties &lsquo;value chain&rsquo; while other corporations directly or indirectly profit off of other&rsquo;s unlicensed works.
