Training your replacement, for free, without consent, and without any forethought on how this will completely devastate the motivation for new IPs seems disastrous. A violation of billions of copyrighted images to &ldquo;train&rdquo; systems should not get a pass simply due to the volume of theft occurring. If anything it should be treated as mass plagiarism simply due to the fact that without the input data, the output would be irrevocably changed. This can clearly be demonstrated by using identical settings with different data sets. <br/><br/>Additionally, from my understanding this would violate many state&rsquo;s unfair competition legislation. <br/><br/>As a final thought, is the mass homogenization of culture what people want from the future? Inevitably the models will need to be retrained on their own outputs due to users uploading them intentionally without metadata to avoid being flagged by automated systems meant to filter them. This will result in model collapse, a well researched and documented outcome of this exact scenario. The only way this current iteration of machine learning ends is with a world made lesser for the sake of already powerful entities making another pointless (long term economics) profit margin for which they themselves refuse to compensate others that were key to this technology being possible; artists, writers, and any other creative profession.
