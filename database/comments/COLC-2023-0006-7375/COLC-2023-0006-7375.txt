Machine learning (artificial intelligence) is not only a job-killer, but morally atrocious. I understand that commerce is the name of the game, but to focus exclusively on that is to kill part of this nation&#39;s collective soul. Our culture is already hyper-fixated on wealth, but if A.I. becomes the standard for art, then art will be nothing but commerce. And A.I. art will assuredly become the standard if unregulated, because it cuts out a lot of costs like wages for those pesky human beings that need food and shelter. <br/><br/>Art is often seen as frivolous, but a life without a music, books, television, games, and all those wonderful things we enjoy, is a life that is diminished. A life with less joy, is a life that is less in every way. Even if it&#39;s something as simple as someone needing a tiny spark of happiness on their one day off from their two jobs that they need to survive. A great TV show binge is better than an illicit drug binge. That may be a bit of a hyperbolic example, but people need relief from the stress of daily life. If you want people to continue to consume a product, you make the best product you can. Cutting corners and producing something of low quality might net some quick gains, but is not sustainable in the long-run. It&#39;s crass to say, but if the powers that be would like to have a complacent populace, then they shouldn&#39;t sabotage the things that keep the populace happy. Bread and circus doesn&#39;t work if you take away all the bakers and clowns. <br/><br/>Even if you don&#39;t care about the integrity of art, keeping its creation in the hands of human artists is just good business and governance.
