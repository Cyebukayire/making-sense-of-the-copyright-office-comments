Generative algorithms of all kinds are an existential threat to all forms of art. They are based fundamentally on a complete disregard for ethics at every level from how the algorithms are trained to do what they do to how they&#39;re envisioned to be used commercially. Their purpose is to take power away from human beings who create art, literally take their faces and voices in the case of film and TV, and allow people without talent or creativity to flood the world with extremely low-effort garbage which might trick enough people into looking at it that they generate a profit on ad revenue.
