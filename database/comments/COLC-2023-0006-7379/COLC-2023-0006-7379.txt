Before I begin, I&#39;d like to request that the Copyright Office read the attached documents. I not only answer every single one of the Copyright Office&#39;s questions, I also provide extensive resources such as URLs, research papers, and hundreds of other people&#39;s comments from over the past year demonstrating the harms and scams surrounding Generative AI.<br/><br/>If you do not have time to read the attached documents, I will summarize my position here.<br/><br/>I believe that the Copyright Office must take the position of never accepting ANY work that uses Generative AI, as it is the goal and purpose of Generative AI systems to circumvent Copyright and Copyright Protections in the first place.<br/><br/>Generative AI systems cannot exist without theft. Theft of art, theft of music, theft of literature, even theft of our voice and likeness. Generative AI systems cannot function without using stolen human labor, in an attempt to supplant and replace that very same human labor. AI companies have stolen creator&#39;s works from all over the world to create illegal commercial products at the expense of the creators without permission, consent, licensing, or respecting the creator&#39;s fundamental human rights.<br/><br/>Generative AI systems are antithetical to the purpose of Copyright, which is to protect human creators and their creations. Anything less than that is a failure to protect the human rights of creators from having their work used against them. There is no way to properly license or compensate creators for their work in AI systems, which by design circumvent the law through obfuscating the scale of theft involved via data laundering.<br/><br/>There is no way for the Copyright Office to manage, let alone review the number of Generative AI works being mass produced off of stolen labor. As of the time of this comment, more Generative AI images have been made than photographs have existed from the time cameras were invented up through the 1970&#39;s. That&#39;s billions of images. This scale of damage took place in less than a year with Generative AI image systems being publicly available. I will repeat: There is no way for the Copyright Office to keep track or spend time reviewing the Copyrights of each AI output.<br/><br/>This scale of harm also buries real creators and their copyrighted works alive. Before Generative AI systems, humans creators were already struggling to get by but could take comfort in seeing works by fellow human creators. This is how culture is formed, with people sharing their works with each other and motivating one another. With the introduction of Generative AI systems, this culture has been destroyed. Creators are now hiding their works out of fear of it being stolen and weaponized against them by Generative AI systems. People are regularly deceived and tricked by scammers impersonating as creators. Deception is rampant and distrust is higher than it has ever been. To make matters worse, creators are now targets for AI companies and AI users seeking to exploit them. As a result, fewer people are willing to create art, create writing, create music, which will hurt and weaken cultures around the world.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is my belief that the Copyright Office must take the stance of disbarring any AI generated work from obtaining a Copyright. Furthermore, if an individual, organization, or company is found to have falsely registered a Copyrighted work using Generative AI in any capacity, they must be disbarred from obtaining any future Copyrights for life or continued existence of the organization or company. This is because individuals, organizations, and companies using AI regularly commit fraud and intent to deceive surrounding AI products as a scammer would with counterfeit goods. Once an individual, organization, or company has shown intent to deceive the Copyright Office, they cannot be trusted with the right to obtain future Copyrights or Copyright protections.
