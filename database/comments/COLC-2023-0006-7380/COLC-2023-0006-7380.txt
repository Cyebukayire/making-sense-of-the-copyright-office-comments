I do not feel that a copyright can or should be generated for something made by a non-human entity. A corporation is made of humans, and humans can generate copyrightable works - but machine-generated works are not generated by humans. To grant copyrights for works generated by nonhumans - even those shepherded by citizens or corporations  - opens ethical quandaries that can never be closed again. <br/><br/>A copyright must protect the work of creators, and protect them from those who would profit off their work. AI and algorithm-generated works run this paradigm in reverse - they print cheap facsimiles of the works of creators, profiting off the work of others, and hiding behind weasel-words and impossible definitions of &quot;fair use&quot; to avoid repercussions.<br/><br/>Copyright law already does not recognize the functional aspects or algorithms of computer programming as copyrightable objects (see Circular 61). It stands to reason, then, that the output of a computer program should equally be noncopyrightable - only human inputs and creations should be copyrightable. A writer who writes a novel in Word has generated a copyrightable work when they click print; a dog has not generated a copyrightable work by mashing its face against the keyboard, and Microsoft has not created a copyrightable work when Word &quot;generates&quot; that &quot;document&quot; or prints it. <br/><br/>If a man spent a thousand man-hours learning to draw Mickey Mouse perfectly, then attempted to sell a shirt with Mickey Mouse&#39;s unmistakeable likeness lightly obscured behind a pair of Groucho Marx glasses, he would be rightly sued by Disney for attempting to profit off their work. <br/><br/>If a man disassembled a Ford F150 in his garage, 3D-scanned every piece, and then 3D-printed customized copies of F150s to sell to his neighbors, Ford&#39;s lawyers would be on his doorstep in a week.<br/><br/>Why, then, when we use the word &quot;AI&quot; or &quot;algorithm,&quot; is it suddenly okay? I do not believe it should be.
