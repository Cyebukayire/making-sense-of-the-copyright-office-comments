I have a large issue with AI and copyright. AI seems to have their &quot;original&quot; work be mostly plagiarism from other established and copywritten works. Most AI pushed into the market right now pulls from a large pool of copyrighted work and does not change it in such a significant way to make it an &quot;original&quot; work. Many picture art works show the signatures of artists or are direct rip-offs of their art with only a slight change, such as what can be done with photo editing software. Written works have had whole pages pulled from them for AI use. The push for these to be used seems like an easy way for companies to try to get &quot;free&quot; work when in reality they are using work from hundreds of artists without paying them properly for their time and effort. This is making it hard for anyone to try to get their work into the world. Actors and other famous people are also having a hard time holding copyright on their own faces and identities as AI is used to replicate not only their faces, but their voices and personalities. Due to this problem with actors, I fear that any photos I share of myself or my family online may be grabbed and used by AI without my permission in this way. I do not wish me, my family, or anyone else to have to fight a battle to claim their own identities and work as owned by them and not an algorithm put out into the world. I implore that you please consider having AI not be copyrightable since it pulls from copywritten works, or for you to consider putting in strict restrictions on what AI can pull from, such as only being able to pull from free-use or public works with no copyright. Thank you for your time.
