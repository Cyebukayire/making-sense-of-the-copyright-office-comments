Generative AI is built on a foundation of theft from artists, musicians, writers, and photographers. Without the data set these systems do not function. There is no intelligence artificial or otherwise. Automation of art does not benefit society. Strong limits and guardrails need to be put in place to keep large corporations from using it to deskill and deleverage workers of all kind. I work in the entertainment industry which is already suffering from tech style gigifcation and massive out sourcing. These systems need to be heavily regulated and should not be eligible for copy write of any kind. On top of the theft and worker issues Gen AI is resource intensive including water usage. We do not need gen AI making gen AI images sometimes know as &quot;AI art&quot; but we do need clean drinking water. I hope the U.S. Copyright Office will do right by the American people and artists the world over by helping put limits and constraints on a technology build on stealing from us. You cannot adapt or competitive with a machine that scrapes your work as you creative and innovate it.
