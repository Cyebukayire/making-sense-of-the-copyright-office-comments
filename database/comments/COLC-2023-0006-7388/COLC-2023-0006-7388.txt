I&#39;ve been fooling with various versions of AI for a while now, and the conclusion that I&#39;ve made is we are not at a point where the AI can just spit out usable works. Perhaps if I wanted a simple picture of kitten -- but if I want a kitten tangled in a ball of yarn, AI usually doesn&#39;t grasp such concepts. Most of the images that I&#39;ve made have had to be heavily photoshopped to result in something that I&#39;m happy with (with the proper amounts of fingers and limbs!).<br/><br/>And as for AI generated writing, it&#39;s even worse. A simple children&#39;s story might be useable with little prompting, but to write a coherent novel or screenplay requires a lot of human intervention in the writing process, followed by a TON of editing. <br/><br/>Yes, the technology is rapidly advancing, but we&#39;re still quite a few years away from it being capable of creating great works without much human interaction. Presently, it&#39;s just a tool like Photoshop or Grammerly or millions of other applications that people use to assist in creation of their content. <br/><br/>In summary, I fully believe that current AI works should be copyrightable, even if it entails a brand new classification of copyright.
