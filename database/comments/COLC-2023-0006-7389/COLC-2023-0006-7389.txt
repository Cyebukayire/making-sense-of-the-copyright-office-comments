The things we create are so deeply personal and meaningful, and to live in a world where those things can be stolen, without consent, would be a grave injustice. Artificial intelligence can be wonderful if it&rsquo;s used to help cure cancer or make society safer, but there is absolutely no need for artificial intelligence to be able to write books, make art, or use someone&rsquo;s image without their consent. Consent is key and there is such a danger in artificial intelligence &ldquo;learning&rdquo; from peoples art and that is not okay. We must ensure that &ldquo;artificial intelligence art&rdquo; cannot ever be given a copyright.
