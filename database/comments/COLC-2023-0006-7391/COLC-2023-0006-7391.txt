AI has been used by individuals and companies as a method of creating quicker products, however at the detriment of actual artists, writers, actors, and other creatives. It is highly predatory and has been using people&#39;s works and identities without consent, violating copyright laws and even committing identity fraud in the cases of voice work being used to train AI. It should not be supported in the way many AI supporters are pushing for, as it is highly disrespectful and preys upon creatives who are the very foundation of the creative industry. Many people have lost their jobs because of it.
