I am a software engineer and am extremely concerned with the development of tools that use AI models trained on copyrighted material which has been used without consent.  At my last job, the CEO pushed the engineering team to develop a tool using AI, as a new feature for the company to make money from.  Then the CEO fired our artists, stating that there was no need to pay for art anymore because it could be freely generated by AI.  This action led to me leaving the company.  AI models are trained by taking art and written works without permission and directly lead to the artists whose work was stolen to be considered no longer necessary by corporations.  Because the models are trained on content which has been taken without consent, I do not believe any AI work should be copyright protected.  I also believe there should be legal protections against AI using any content without permission of the creator.
