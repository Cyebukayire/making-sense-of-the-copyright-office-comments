AI as it is used right now, uses works from people who have spent time and energy creating them as part of their data set. Usually these pieces are stolen and used for the data set without permission from the author of the piece. As a result of this people can essentially steal any writting or art style and use it without ever paying back the orginal author of that style. Then the people who prompt the AI profit off of the AI, while the people who helped build the data set are not provided substantial payment for use of their works. <br/><br/>Artifical Intelligence is not copyright compliant for these reasons.
