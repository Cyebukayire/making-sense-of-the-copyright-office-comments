Thank you for opening this subject up to public comment. I am a concerned member of the public who is being presented with the AI conundrum in both personal and work spheres and who has some serious apprehension on how it is both currently being used and the potential future use. Anyone whose work is not already in the public domain and is used by AI technology to train or develop AI should be allowed and required to give consent before such work is &#39;fed&#39; into an AI data set or other form of training. I am personally aware of at least one instance where a third-party uploaded an author&#39;s writing to an AI data set without the original author&#39;s knowledge or consent, thereby rendering the author&#39;s intellectual property freely available for that AI&#39;s training and use. In addition, the original human creators who give consent for the use of their works in AI data sets and training should be fairly compensated and their copyright upheld, as in the current instances of quoting a poem in a book, including a song in a movie, etc. Furthermore, AI-generated work itself, especially in its current iteration - as it is significantly built upon the use of copyrighted materials obtained without the copyright holder&#39;s knowledge, consent, or compensation (thereby being an instance of copyright infringement) - should not be able to be copyrighted without significant and quantifiable human improvement and modification of the AI-generated work. Thank you again for this opportunity to comment.
