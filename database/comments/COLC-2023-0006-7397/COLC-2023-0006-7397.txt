As an artist interested in using algorithmic and generative tools in my creative process, I am deeply disturbed that I can spend hours engineering and refining my prompt and parameters to create the artwork I want, and am then told by the copyright office that I am not allowed to copyright the result of those efforts. Prompt-driven generative AI is a deterministic and mechanical tool of creators, not a creator itself, and the works produced are the result of, and reflective of, the human creators. The copyright office&#39;s current stance is akin to arguing that a painting cannot be copyrighted because the brush, not the artist, did the painting. &quot;Generative&quot; AI tools such as Midjourney do nothing without human input to drive them and, given that a &quot;seed&quot; can be manually specified as part of the process, their output is the direct deterministic result of that human input, even if the process they use is highly complex. I hope the agency will adopt a smarter, more fair stance that allows human artists using AI tools to create visual images to copyright those images, and protect the results of the occasionally vast amount of prompt engineering work they do to create them, as they ought to be able to.
