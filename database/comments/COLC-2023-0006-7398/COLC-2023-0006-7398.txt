I personally think that AI should have no protection against copyright as actual people who do the work already have pretty loose copyright protection, I think that instead, laws should be focused on enforcing those copyright laws for people and AI should get zero benefit. Respectfully, AI is being used mainly in corrupt ways and that is not what it&#39;s there for.
