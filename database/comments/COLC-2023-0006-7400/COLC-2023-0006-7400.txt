While the idea of copyrights initially was meaningful, they have gotten more and more harmful as time passes, restricting creative problem solving, playful expression, and artistic collaborations.  Certainly, some of us humans still like the idea of being able to control the content we create and share, and we don&#39;t want corporations to take our work as is, or with only small changes, and make a profit off of our content, but beyond that point, in a world where new content is generated every second, and with remix culture as the new norm, most copyright law is outdated, at best.  As an artist, scientist, and teacher, what I&#39;ve always done, and also encouraged students to do, is take in all the natural and human-made sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile experiences in the environment, rearrange them in some way that feels useful for describing something important, and then share that with the world.  I personally hope we individuals can all do this without fear of lawsuits.<br/><br/>So, in light of what I see as our species&#39; ever-growing need to be more informed and more enlightened, I suggest that future copyright laws be pared back to the most minimal function of simply giving individual content creators the right to any profits made from their content in the content&#39;s original form, or extremely similar copies.  If I copy your content directly, and then sell that copy, you have a right to any profit I make.  Anything beyond that, including qualitative remixing, short/partial snippets, stylistic nods, and use for educational/political/cultural commentary should be not just allowed, but encouraged.  &quot;Fair use&quot; should be clearly and intentionally expanded to anything other than direct, or nearly entire, copies for significant profit.  (Insignificant profit would be, as an example, someone having music on in the background of a video they are filming/streaming where they get a small-to-moderate amount of income from ad revenue from a platform they are using to distribute the video (YouTube, Twitch, etc.).  And direct/nearly-direct copies means not adding any meaningful contribution of personal expression for the purpose of making a profit.)<br/><br/>Basically, we want a world where we individuals are free to share our stories, ideas, and solutions in whatever way seems most effective for our audience, and we want the right to protect our stories, ideas, and solutions from corporate profiteering.
