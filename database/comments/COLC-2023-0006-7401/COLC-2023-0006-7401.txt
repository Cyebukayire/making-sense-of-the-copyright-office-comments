AI should not be trained on copyrighted material if the prompter is to receive authorship for the AI output, or AI works shouldn&#39;t be copyright-able, or another solution should be found.  Currently the &quot;tool&quot; is outputting others&#39; work.  This would be like if photographers were paid for photoshoots but not the models, or if publishers were given credit for books but not the authors.  There are two sides to the (presumed) art, and to leave out either side is hardly fair.
