My thought is/has been said here: to be subject to copyright, &ldquo;so far as they are representatives of original intellectual conceptions of the author. The Court defined an &ldquo;author&rdquo; as &ldquo;he to whom anything owes its origin; originator; maker; one who completes a work of science or literature.&rdquo;&thinsp; (14) It repeatedly referred to such &ldquo;authors&rdquo; as human, describing authors as a class of &ldquo;persons&rdquo;&thinsp; (15) and a copyright as &ldquo;the exclusive right of a man to the production of his own genius or intellect.&rdquo;&thinsp;<br/><br/>I hope that human to human, we will lean more toward this aspect. As an artist, I use &quot;tools&quot; to create &quot;original&quot; and &quot;intellectual&quot; drawings/paintings with graphics/computer programs. NO AI is used. I think we need to really consider the term &quot;Artificial&quot; as the thing that makes it NOT &quot;Authentic&quot; intelligence. Therefore as a fellow artist and human, I can be &quot;inspired&quot; by other &quot;human/authors&quot; but I CAN NOT COPY because that infringes on their work of intellectual conceptions. Therefore, there should be strict guides for the registration of work of art that is used by AI. As one who is a Software Engineer as well, AI is a TOOL to be used, right? just like any medium, I choose to use to create. However, in the event, that, If I decide to use the TOOLS to go against the law of &quot;copyrights&quot; of other human/authors&#39; work. Is it NOT inhuman to do so, wouldn&#39;t I be punished and held accountable?<br/><br/>Another example is the human fingerprints is all unique to each person on a planet of billions of humans, and NO ONE has the exact same fingerprint. GOD GIVEN by design for one purpose of uniqueness, and individuality. Therefore, when it comes to AI since It is/has been used to &quot;learn&quot; from all the data of posted intellectual work that is out there on the web of actual human beings to me it&#39;s like a hacker or a criminal using someone else&#39;s fingerprint for a selfish gain against another&#39;s livelihood. I could use many examples that have already been fought against in the area this area of intellectual conceptions/ properties etc. <br/><br/>Therefore, If we the people truly want to be human and be mindful of our fellow human counterparts abroad. The Copyright Office as the &quot;Governing&quot; Authority should KEEP the law so ALL have to abide by it otherwise it is breaking the laws of fellow mankind, right? We all know what the term &quot;CON-ARTIST&quot; means. I speak to this the event AI is used to copy/learn from others&#39; works of art in any form. So, why give ways for this to just occur and then be looking like a deer in headlights when the inhuman occurs? We also, know there are some humans who are genuinely mindful of morals with respect to others, and we know there are others who simply are of an evil mind(not moral). So to whoever is in the position of Governing authority to protect and to keep things in a way that ALL benefits, Please really consider this and ALL that is at stake here in regards to how a TOOL would be used, in a moral or immoral sense and the implication of this.<br/><br/>I can only hope as a fellow artist that you all will make a wise decision to uphold the law and governance to protect and to not infringe or be a part of infringements.
