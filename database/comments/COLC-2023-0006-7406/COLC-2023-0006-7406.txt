As an artist, AI puts my livelihood at risk. It is a common practice for AI image generator databases to not ask for permission to sample an artist&#39;s work, henceforth steering customers and profits away from human artists. Effectively, image generators create bootleg works of art frankenstined from various sources. Generated images, videos, and text should not be protected under copyright law.
