I make my living as a writer, and I am also an artist. It disturbs me greatly that tech companies are basically stealing people&rsquo;s work for their own pockets. A person&rsquo;s creative work belongs to them, and the copyright protections should reflect this. The tech industry has very little regard for or interest in the arts, as evidenced by the lack of support by owners such as Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos, just to name a few. This country has always produced amazing artists, people who challenge boundaries and not only delight and entertain us but highlight injustices and ways we can do better. Please deeply consider the ramifications of copyright rules and AI and protect the work of human beings.  This is a pivotal moment and how we respond to this will determine the kind of future we all have to live in. Artists, musicians, and writers are counting on you.
