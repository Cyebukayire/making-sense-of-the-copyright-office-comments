AI users shouldn&#39;t be allowed to use other people works for learning, unless they get explicit permission from the creator (and NOT due to sudden change of ToS of a website already used by thousands of human artists). Furthermore, AI works shouldn&#39;t be subject to copyright, as they are not made by a person, but a programme.
