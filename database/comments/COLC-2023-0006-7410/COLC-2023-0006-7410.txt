like many people who write and post free fiction, the knowledge that my work is being read (hopefully enjoyed) by humans *is* payment. that our work is being taken to train AIs to THEN be used to make money for others is a perversion of the agreement. the solution? there should be a box that EASILY AND CLEARLY indicates - should i check it - that i have denied permission for companies to USE my work to train AI. end of story - no pun intended. (easy test that, well, i&#39;m not an AI)
