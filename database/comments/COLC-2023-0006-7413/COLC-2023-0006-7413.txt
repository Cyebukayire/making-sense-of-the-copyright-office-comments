Personally, I&rsquo;ve seen mostly negative effects of the use of AI within the digital art community. Artists who dedicate so much time and labor into their art piece&#39;s are struggling to keep up with those that blatantly claim AI generated art as there own for profit. This is unfair to artists who actually have to put thought, feeling, and time into their pieces. Another negative aspect of AI generated art is the copyright issue of things. AI generated art uses art that already exists online and meshes a bunch of artworks that belong to different artist in less than a second. It is truly a terrifying tool that is overpowered and unoriginal in a way that takes away from the whole purpose of art, which is a form of expression. I believe laws should be implemented into AI generated art to ban it entirely or restricted its accessibility to all art held in the wide web in order to protect the labor and time of the human beings we see trying to live or gain happiness off of their artistry.
