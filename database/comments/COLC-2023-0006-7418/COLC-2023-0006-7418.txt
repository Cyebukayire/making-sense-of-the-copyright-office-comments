Ai created materials should not be allowed to be copyrighted. We do not allow copyright on things grown in nature to create herbal medicines because they are not human creation. The same should be of Ai creations. The human that plugged in requests for the Ai to create something has done nothing original to earn that right of copyrighting the results. <br/>Especially when you consider the fact that the Ai was trained on copyrighted materials without the consent or payment of the human creators, so you can&rsquo;t even say that the material created by the Ai is entirely original as it has committed theft of others&rsquo; creations. <br/>Likewise, all Ai companies that have trained their material on copyrighted sources should pay for every training cycle it has used it for - back pay and future use - unless the owner of said work sells use of their copyrighted material. <br/>And think of the chaos of if people were allowed to copyright Ai creations in the realm of voices and sayings, any person would be free to make a voice or a sentence copyrighted and then a regular person, politician, a star, newscaster happens to have a voice similar or has said that exact phrase out of coincidence, and now they&rsquo;ve got a copyright case against them. <br/>In summation, Ai companies have committed copyright theft and should pay the humans they&rsquo;ve stolen from, Ai creations Are Not human, original creation and therefore should not be allowed to be copyrighted, and should you allow it to be so, the resulting mess of anybody copyrighting anything Ai creates is inadvisable. <br/>Also, not all Ai is bad, but it should be only considered to have the rights as a calculator does. You can&rsquo;t copyright the results a calculator gives you just because you typed in your request and got an answer. Ai should remain a technological aid, not crank-lever people can pull to create something unoriginal and stamp a copyright on.
