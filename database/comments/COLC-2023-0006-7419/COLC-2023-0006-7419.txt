To the U.S. Copyright Office and Other Concerned parties,<br/><br/>I would like to thank you for creating a forum for open discussion in the matter of Copyright Materials used in AI Training Databases. As AI becomes more prevalent and popular in mainstream industries, I have found many companies overlook those who may be more heavily affected by choices made without their opinion. Thank you very much for allowing creators to express their opinions in a constructive way.<br/><br/>I believe I may be in a unique position to comment on this legislative conundrum, as I am both a Self-Published Author and a full-time Software Engineer. As such, I have a deeper understanding of AIs and the programming and effort required to develop them. I also understand the work needed to create a copyright-protected material and the value of obtaining a copyright in the first place. I believe my opinions may, at the minimum, provide a good starting place for research into this inquiry.<br/><br/>Following the request posted in document COLC-2023-0006-0001, &ldquo;Artificial Intelligence and Copyright&rdquo;, by the U.S. Copyright Office, I have reviewed and commented on as many questions as I felt I had experience and knowledge to address. I have compiled these questions and my correlating response in the attached document for ease of reference. I have also added hyperlinks to any supporting documentation I found while researching for more supporting details. Should any Replies be posted with further questions, I will do my best to answer to my fullest knowledge.<br/><br/>To summarize the contents of the attached document, I do not believe copyright material should be allowed in AI training databases without permission of copyright holders, regardless of whether that database is for research purposes or commercial use. Copyright-protected materials, once entered, cannot be expunged from a training database without requiring the AI to be scrapped and started over from scratch. I do not believe there is a licensing model that would successfully control or protect the integrity of copyright protections, as AIs present a type of technology which can create hundreds of thousands of free duplications of works in a very short time-span. As the return on investment for this method is low to negative for some types of copyright creations, only materials permitted by copyright owners should be used for training databases.<br/><br/>Your efforts to consider the impact of this important decision to the creator community are to be applauded.  I understand this choice in regards to Copyright Material and Artificial Intelligence will shape the current creative landscape in a way no one could have foreseen even ten years ago. I appreciate your caution in this regard and hope that you will find my comments helpful in this endeavor.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>
