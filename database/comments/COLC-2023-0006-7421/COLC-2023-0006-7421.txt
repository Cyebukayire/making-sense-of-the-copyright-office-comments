&bull; AI must be regulated heavily to prevent the abuse of false information spreading across the internet. <br/>&bull; This information can be used as extortion, blackmail, imitation, scamming and more. It can be used to sway elections whatever party one may believe in. It can be used to steal from real hard working people. <br/>&bull; AI has already been used in scam calls to imitate voices, being used to scam families by pretending to be a family member in danger. <br/>&bull; AI threatens out own autonomy over our voices and personal likeness, becoming a soulless clone used in pursuit of money.<br/>&bull; Malicious people can alter history or corrupt search results with the use of AI.<br/>&bull; Overall my concerns for AI is diluting truth and liberty, as well as it snatching away work other people have done for itself, or the user using the AI.<br/>I am a digital and traditional artist, I make 3D art. It is a craft I have worked on for a good chunk of my life. AI allows people to get a hold of my artwork if I upload it anywhere on the net, put it through their machine and make profit off of what I created. Artwork is a human creation that is sacred. Everything we look at that is manmade was created through art. AI threatens to ruin the human spirit of Art. <br/><br/>This is a Pandora&#39;s box.
