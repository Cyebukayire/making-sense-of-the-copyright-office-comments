I work with AI/ML voices and voice cloning tools as part of my job as a software and game developer, and am well versed in the nuances around the subject of copyright and likeness rights. <br/><br/>It is my opinion that we DO NOT need another layer of law specifically addressing this area of use, as I have found that applying the current and well established principles regarding copyright works and Likeness Rights provides sufficient guidance on what is and is not &#39;lawful&#39; use.<br/><br/>I urge the U.S. Copyright office to shelve the NO FAKES act (the &#39;backronym&#39; is catchy, which has been a huge Red Flag for a problematic law since the PATRIOT Act) and provide a clear and formal statement that Copyright and Likeness Rights of an individual (to the extent that the Copyright Office is responsible for Likeness Rights) DO APPLY to all content created via Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.<br/><br/>Example: Today, it is (generally) Fair Use to create a comedic Parody work featuring a &#39;sound-alike&#39; live actor _impersonator_ of Roseanne Barr and presenting this &#39;sound alike&#39; voice actor impersonator AS Roseanne Barr for the purposes of comedic Parody - but I _cannot_ use that same live actor to impersonate Rosanne Barr in a way that creates the impression that Roseanne Barr herself endorses my product. That violates the REAL Roseanne Barr&#39;s Likeness Rights. This same principle should apply to an AI/ML-generated likeness of Roseanne Barr, and the US Copyright Office can issue an opinion to this effect WITHOUT creating another &#39;layer&#39; of law that the courts will have to disentangle in the future.
