Since A.I generated work is based off of pre-existing work and always will be, it can be said that A.I generated *everything* is not and will never be, owned by anyone.  It is stealing work from other people without consent or knowledge.  A.I generated work should be illegal to profit off of (unless the information fed into it is legally permitted) and illegal to use to spread information online, including having it appear in internet searches.
