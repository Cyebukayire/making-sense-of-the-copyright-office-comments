I believe that any AI generated image or text that sufficiently resembles a work presented or created by a real person should follow maintain the same copyright infringement status as if it were made by a real person. That is to say, if the AI generated image and/or text would be considered copyright infringement and/or plagiarism were it made by a real person, then it should still be considered so, and the person(s) responsible for providing the prompt that generated the image and/or text should be made responsible.
