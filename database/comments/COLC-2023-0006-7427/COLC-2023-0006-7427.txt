I come from a literary family. My mother is a writer. When she was a young single mother in New York City, she supported her family by ghostwriting parenting books. She now writes under her own name. All of these books have shown up on lists of books fed into AI machines as training data with no consent from her and no payment to her. My father is a literary agent, and many of his clients books have shown up on those lists, too. My family&#39;s whole legacy, all the work we make our money from, is being taken without consent and turned into a machine to take any jobs that might help me support myself in the same stage of life as my mother was when she was ghostwriting those parenting books. I won&#39;t have the same avenues to success that she was able to take. There won&#39;t be any ghostwriting gigs for me, because those jobs will be taken by machines trained on my mother&#39;s work. They are stealing work from my mother&#39;s generation to deny work to my generation. It&#39;s unconscionable, it&#39;s blatant copyright infringement, and it shouldn&#39;t be allowed.
