While Artificial Intelligence has the potential to be a useful tool, in its current form Artificial Intelligence is the culmination of the stolen work of artists, authors, and so many others. This unauthorized use of work to train AI models without the express permission of those whose work, art, images, likeness, etc., is used only shows that the copyright of those who produced the original work needs to be protected. Many people base their livelihoods on the art they make, their writing, their voice among other things that are now being used without permission by AI engines. To allow users of these AI systems to claim ownership of anything generated by a text prompt to create an amalgamation based on stolen work would not only be an violation of copyright law but set a dangerous precedent removing what protections people do have on their work, art, or likeness, among the various things AI is currently being used for. <br/><br/>The Copyright Office has a duty to protect the copyright of artists, authors, actors, creatives and non-creatives alike. One possible way to protect their copyright would be to state that anything generated by Artificial Intelligence must indicate that it has been artificiality generated. What people have spent hours or days of their time on should not be allowed to be stolen or used by others without permission unless that individual states that it can be used anyone for whatever use they want. It falls on the Copyright Office to protect this kind of work from those who would replace them and their creations with the results of an AI bot query. Artificial Intelligence must be regulated as soon as possible to protect people whose livelihoods are at stake.
