Artificial Intelligence must be regulated. The first concern that comes to mind with the current state of A.I. is that young children with no or little internet regulation will and are be able to generate whatever image or prompt they would like. They could ask a system to generate an image of a &ldquo;video game war&rdquo; and may view gore or a shocking image when they were looking for something else. Alternatively, this could allow adults to willingly ask A.I. to generate harmful pornography, gore, and more with or without the intent to redistribute it elsewhere. Additionally, A.I. has already been used to create and sell misinformation, whether by generating false images or articles. There is also the topic of plagiarism in schools. Several students worldwide have submitted completely original material, and been told it was generated by A.I. Few of these students have support or proof for them in these cases as well. A.I. left unregulated will cause the end to the free sharing of information on the internet. People will need to verify if information is true or valid before properly taking it in, along with all of the points outlined previously.
