It is my utmost belief that AI is already doing incredible damage, and will continue to. It steals material from people and creates from something that was not CREATED. It was remixed. With stolen material. Nothing that is being used by AI has the proper permission to be used. What will be the point of having copyright or ownership when there is a program out there that will take it and use it regardless. Our country is built on agency and being able to make your own destiny, and that includes owning and knowing that what you own is protected. If AI is not being regulated, or tempered, it will destroy more than the arts. It will steal products. It will create facts. Everything we see will be a fabrication, and human knowledge - the humanities, the arts, what gives us a soul - will be replaced by 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s. AI MUST be regulated. It&#39;s far too powerful. The damage it is already doing is irreversible.
