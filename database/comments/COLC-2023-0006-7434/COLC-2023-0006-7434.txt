I was advised you are accepting submissions from non Americans. I am submitting because American law affects both what I see, and influences my own country&#39;s laws.<br/><br/>I am concerned by AI as pertains to copyright law for the following combination of reasons<br/>AI is trained on data where permission is not obtained prior to training.<br/>AI is trained on data where permission is opt out rather than opt in.<br/>AI output based on these training data is then sold.<br/><br/>While I cannot be certain, there is increasingly rumours of creative individuals being told they cannot have work unless they give permission to use their work or image for AI. This kind of coercion concerns me, and I would like to see any law be biased against this kind of behaviour even if it is not yet actually occurring.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine that the labour saving proposals for AI will not result in it being used commercially extensively. I would prefer the people who made/make the training data to be appropriately compensated for this given they will effectively putting themselves and others out of work.<br/><br/>I have other concerns involving AI, amongst others pertaining to the lack of consideration of implicit bias in the data set. While this is not directly relevant to copyright law, I would like you to consider the likely influence of significant commercial output from AI that is not appropriately trained.<br/><br/>Thankyou for your consideration.
