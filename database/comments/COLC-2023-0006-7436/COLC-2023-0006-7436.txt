My chief concern is that machine learning models that are based on data sets used without permission are flagrantly unethical. If a tool cannot exist until it has been fed untold amounts of human generated content, then the humans who created that content should have at least as much claim over that tool as the developers involved, if not far, far more. It&#39;s distressing that these AI tools have been publicly available for as long as they have been without any kind of legal entity stepping in to put a stop to it.<br/><br/>As for the other questions posed: all works generated by AI are infringing if they&#39;re based on unethically sourced data. Imitation of a human artist is besides the point, because we&#39;re dealing with something deeply heinous long before the AI produces anything that blatantly exploitable. In my opinion, AI generated output should be copywritable to whoever genrated it, as long as the data to produce the model was sourced ethically.
