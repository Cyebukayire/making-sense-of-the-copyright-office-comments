If the AI takes images made by people to create it&rsquo;s own, and not all of those people agreed to their image being used, then it&rsquo;s clearly theft and using others talents for someones else&#39;s benefit without consent. No other way to see it. Devalues the heart, creativity, and effort a human puts into writing or drawing or creating against their will. And AI at this point in time doesn&rsquo;t know the difference between correct information and wrong information, potentially shoving lies or just sucking up to the views of the user (whether right or wrong). The AI may be growing and learning more information, but our brains definitely aren&rsquo;t, clearly.
