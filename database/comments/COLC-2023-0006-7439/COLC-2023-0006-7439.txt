Imagine placing a device on a person that observes their every thought, movement or personality. This device collects the data, compiles it into a new persona but better and more efficient. This then replaces the original.<br/>The question arises, if this new persona is better and more efficient than the original, wouldn&#39;t it be better for society? Why not look beyond someones individual and selfish gain, for advancement of society? <br/>One stands correct for these arguments, we need to progress, but<br/>atleast take consent before placing this device on that person. Is this not what it means to be free?
