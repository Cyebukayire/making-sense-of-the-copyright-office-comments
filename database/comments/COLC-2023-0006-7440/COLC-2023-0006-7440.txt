Good afternoon or morning, <br/><br/>With the pressing matter of AI technology sweeping the web in all directions I believe strict regulations and control over the use of this technology is necessary. Right now kids are using it to create funny images which is cute but as the technology improves and as more tech companies incorporate this into their own software I.E. Google is can be a detrimental loss for the free internet and free information. It compromises the integrity of the web (which it already lacks so much of) and will make it almost impossible to find real information. Allowing companies especially corporations to create and fabricate information that is treated as truth can lead to a disaster. I implore you to seek ways to heavily regulate this field, while extremely exciting and a breakthrough in human engineering proceeding wit caution is needed. Our selfishness and greed will lead to this technology becoming nothing more than a shill of what it could be rather than reach it&rsquo;s true potential of genuine artificial intelligence.
