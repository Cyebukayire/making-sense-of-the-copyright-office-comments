This is my second and last comment to the Copyright Office, as I had forgotten to submit this notorious example as to how AI is used to commit willful copyright infringement by acting as copyright washing software. The PDF attached to this comment is proof of the following URL in the event that the post is deleted.<br/><br/>https://twitter.com/heyBarsee/status/1621411036426280961<br/><br/>Generative AI software&#39;s sole purpose is to plagiarize, compete with, and eventually replace photographers, artists, musicians, authors, actors, and just about any kind of creative work. Generative AI cannot do this without civilization-scale theft of creative works, almost all of which are copyrighted. This means that AI companies have committed the largest-scale heist of creative works in human history with the intent of violating fundamental human rights.<br/><br/>Due to how much of a threat Generative AI poses to everyone through the use of deepfakes, fake video, fake photographs, fake literature, fake art, and destroying the validity of information and news, Generative AI should be made completely illegal without any exception.<br/><br/>Generative AI does not benefit creators and never will benefit creators. Generative AI in practice exploits creators and dehumanizes them. Generative AI reduces the significance of art and culture into little more than data points for tech companies and AI users to profit from at the expense of creator&#39;s livelihoods. It is the responsibility of the Copyright Office to not only ensure that creators and their works can never be exploited in this manner, but that the Copyright Office should petition Congress to pass legislation banning all forms of Generative AI without exception. Do not even permit licensing for developing &quot;&quot;&quot;ethical&quot;&quot;&quot; versions of Generative AI with creator&#39;s consent. Ban Generative AI entirely and criminalize its usage for both AI developers and AI users.<br/><br/>Because my stance is that Generative AI should be completely illegal without any exception, I urge the Copyright Office to disbar any AI work from ever obtaining a Copyright regardless of any amount of human involvement, and to permanently disbar any individual, company, or organization from obtaining future Copyrights if they falsely register an AI work as if it were a real work. Do not provide any Copyright protection to unethical plagiarism software outputs. I would like the Copyright Office to outright state that the second any kind of AI use is involved, the work can no longer be eligible for any kind of Copyright protection. The Copyright Office should also state that using Generative AI programs amounts to willful Copyright Infringement and is thus not only illegal but that AI developers and AI users can and will be held liable for damages to the creators they stole from. This kind of direct language is the only way for companies and individuals using AI to listen and stop plagiarizing creative works. Any AI users or companies that continue this infringement should be prosecuted.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my second comment. Please protect creators so that the future is not written with stolen words.
