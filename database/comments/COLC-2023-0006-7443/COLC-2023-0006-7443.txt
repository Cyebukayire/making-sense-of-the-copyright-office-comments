Artificial intelligence is dangerous when in the wrong hands and should be relegated immediately. AI can be a threat to many people with jobs, however it can also be used in conjunction with human effort. In the case of artists, AI could be used to easily replicate textures that would otherwise be extremely difficult and slow to produce. AI can be used to make slow parts of jobs more efficient, but it should not be used for everything, and it should in no way entirely replace anyone.
