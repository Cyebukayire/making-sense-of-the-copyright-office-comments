I don&#39;t believe AI art should allowed to be copyrighted. Past US legal precedent has stated that nonhuman created art is not subject to copyrights such as in Naruto v Slader 888 F.3d 418 (9th Cir 2018). AI art is simply a computer program rendering pixels together based on a series of inputs, most of which is scraped off of copyrighted material and then plagiarizes that artwork. It put the livelihoods of human beings at risk. It would be arbitrary and capricious to go against precedent an allow nonhuman created art to be copyrighted and treated with the same level of protections as human made art.
