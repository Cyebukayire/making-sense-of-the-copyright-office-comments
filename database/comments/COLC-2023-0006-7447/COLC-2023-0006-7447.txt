&quot;AI&quot; as we know it today is not an intelligent form that has it&#39;s own ideas and creates works of art. It&#39;s just a program that takes preexisting media and mushes them together in response to a prompt a person enters. It is theft. And it has gotten worse and worse since the new website ai programs came out. I am very upset by the thought that people/hollywood will use ai to &quot;write&quot; stories/scripts for them and sell those. Nothing I have seen so far has been worth their refusal to use an actual human writer. If anything it&#39;s a nightmare. It honestly scares me to think that this could be considered the new norm.
