AI art never should have been used for more than experimentation and jokes. It has no reason to be bought or sold like authentic works. There&#39;s no stopping technological progress, but there will always be a need for ethics in the world, which I can only hope the law would uphold. Many of my peers and friends and I make art- myself being a realism artist, a style often coopted by those who use machine-learning generative programs- and now I have to fear someone scraping my or my friends&#39; art and selling the extracted &#39;data&#39; (from intentional work the scraper does not own) off as their own. No current data set, to my knowledge, is clean of stolen work. Furthermore, when an exchange of money for creative work is made, what the customer is paying for are the applied technical skills and discerning eye that a creator fosters through their efforts. It is dishonest and bad business to pretend that the usage of AI/machine-learning fulfills the same purpose.
