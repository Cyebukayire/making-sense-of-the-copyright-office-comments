AI-generated content is transformative work. I don&#39;t think it is feasible or reasonable to ban it outright, but I do think that regulations need to be established regarding transparency:<br/>Creators and programmers of AI should have a clear and accessible means of showing which works were used in their learning dataset, and who the creators of those works were.<br/>Creators of work used in the creation of AI should be given a reliable working means of having their work removed from the AI&#39;s dataset, as in the process of submitting copyright strikes for the unauthorized use of their work on various online states.<br/>People who post or share AI-generated content in any capacity besides personal private use must include a clear disclaimer that the work was AI-generated and which program was used to generate the content.<br/>Websites and users of websites whose content is scraped for data to teach AI should be given a reliable working means to opt out of allowing their work to be used in AI datasets.
