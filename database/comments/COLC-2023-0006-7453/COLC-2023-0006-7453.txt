The most important component of AI use is disclosure. That is, when AI is used to create any sort of content, whether that is process writing, news writing, or other forms of content, it must be identified as having been created and produced using AI. Also, creators (writers, visual artists, actors, and the like) must not have their words or images or other likenesses used to train AI or otherwise used by AI without their explicit consent.
