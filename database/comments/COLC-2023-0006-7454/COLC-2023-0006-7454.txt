When it comes to using a person&#39;s likeliness (voice, face, physical appearance) in AI generated content, it should fall under it&#39;s own copyright laws. It should be especially strict for all businesses who attempt to do this, since they made it clear that they want to take advantage of actors in this way. It should be punishable by extremely hefty fines for businesses and jail time for the executives that make the decision to use a person&#39;s AI generated likeliness. For individuals who uses a person&#39;s AI generated likeliness to spread misinformation, it should also be punishable by fines and possible jail time in more severe cases (such as using an important figure&#39;s likeliness to spread fear and misinformation that could endanger people&#39;s lives). Using a person&#39;s AI generated likeliness to create content should be legally considered identity theft and defamation. Any and all revenue generated from using a person&#39;s likeliness for AI generated content (by business or individual) should be paid in full to the person or persons whose likeliness was used. In cases where a deceased person&#39;s likeliness has been used, any and all revenue generated should be paid in full to the deceased person&#39;s family. All AI generated content using a person&#39;s likeliness should automatically come with an apparent and obvious warning that it is AI generated. At the request of the person whose likeliness is being used (or by the person&#39;s family in the case that they are deceased), any AI generated content of their likeliness should be immediately removed from all digital platforms. <br/>- <br/>Using a person&#39;s art (visual, literary, musical) to create AI generated content should also fall under its own copyright laws. Again, it should be very strict for businesses who use a person&#39;s art to create AI generated content, punishable by extremely hefty fines for businesses and jail time for executives. Individuals who use a person&#39;s art to create AI generated content should also be punished with fines and possible jail time in the case that they are using the generated content for their own profit or for spreading misinformation. Using a person&#39;s art for AI generated content should be legally considered identity theft and defamation. Any and all revenue generated from using a person&#39;s art for AI generated content (by business or individual) should be paid in full to the person or persons whose art was used. In the case where a deceased person&#39;s art has been used, any and all revenue generated should be paid in full to the deceased person&#39;s family. All AI generated content using a person&#39;s art should automatically come with an apparent and obvious warning that it is AI generated. At the request of the person whose art is being used (or by the person&#39;s family for a deceased person), any AI generated content of their art should be immediately removed from all digital platforms. <br/>-<br/>AI generated content that is meant to provide information (books, websites, articles) should once again fall under its own copyright laws. Though it may not use a person&#39;s likeliness or art, it still deserves regulation. Any AI generated books, websites, and articles that are meant to provide information should automatically come with a very apparent and obvious warning that it is AI generated. It should also obviously state whether or not it has been peer reviewed by professionals of the topic, who will be apparent and obviously listed as reviewing and approving the AI generated information. Individuals or businesses that create or post AI generated books, websites, or articles should be subject to heavy fines and possible jail time for failing to provide obvious and apparent warnings or by falsely listing it as peer reviewed. <br/>&bull;<br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my comment and listen to my opinions.
