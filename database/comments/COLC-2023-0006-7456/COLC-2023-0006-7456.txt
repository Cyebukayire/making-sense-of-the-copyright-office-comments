Artificial &quot;Intelligence&quot;  is unethical and wrong. it uses STOLEN art and STOLEN writing (both of which are protected under copyright) from both  small creators and extremely well known creators (such as disney) to make what it creates. (in the case of writing, it is notoriously riddled with misinformation.) &quot;AI&quot; is trained on works made by real people, without their permission, knowledge, and without compensation. Without those artists and writers, &quot;AI&quot; couldn&#39;t even exist in the first place. &quot;AI&quot; cannot take inspiration, it can only steal. <br/>I believe that anything created by &quot;AI&quot; absolutely should not be copyrighted or used for commercial work, UNLESS, maybe, if every single person who&#39;s work trained the AI was named in the copyright and compensated.<br/>I also believe that &quot;AI&quot; programs should be harshly penalized if they are found to be using another person&#39;s work without their permission to train their &quot;AI&quot;, in the form of payout to the original creator(s) of the works.
