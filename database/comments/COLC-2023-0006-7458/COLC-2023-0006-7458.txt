Artificial intelligence cannot be ethical when the data it is built upon was taken without knowledge or informed consent from all relative parties. Since artificial intelligence has no creative intentions, it cannot take and transform art in a way that would qualify as fair use. It selects pieces and repeats them in new contexts, but it does not produce a meaningfully distinct artwork.
