AI that utilizes art, writing, and other resources neither it nor it&#39;s operator had any hand in creating - material whose copyright (if active) is held by other persons or entities than the AI or the operator have legal access - the product of AI should not be subject to copyright or be claimable by the operator of the AI program that created it or by the creator of the AI itself.  If an AI is trained completely on material not under copyright, i.e. works in the public domain that are clearly notated as such, that could, arguably, be copyrighted by the operator of the AI.  Works created by AI should be clearly and completely marked or notated as created by AI so as not to be confused with original works in the interest of maintaining a clear and concise historical record and so it does not confuse the public.  Text that is put forward from AI should be noted as AI created to avoid misinformation and misleading content in the public domain.  AI should not be used by news outlets or presented as factual at any point.  AI created content and AI operators should not receive the same protections as citizens and their creations are provided by regulation in the United States.  It is not the same, and this should be acknowledged and enforced - especially when utilized at the corporate, municipal, public, or legal level.
