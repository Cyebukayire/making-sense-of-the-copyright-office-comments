I personally believe that AI programs should not be allowed to use any media as training material UNLESS they have EXPLICT permission from the creators of said media to do so. Otherwise it would become extremely dangerous in the future to prove who made what and so forth. It could go as far as faking evidence for a crime if the AI programs are given free reign to use whatever material they want. There needs to be strict guidelines on using things like that as it can go very far way too quickly.
