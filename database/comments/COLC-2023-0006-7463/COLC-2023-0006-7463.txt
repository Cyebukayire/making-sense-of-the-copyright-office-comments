Any sort of &ldquo;art&rdquo; or any creation made using solely AI is, simply put, not art. It was not made by a person, and uses the work of other existing artists, writers, real people who put a lot of hard work into honing their craft, to cheat their way into what they feel is success. AI creations very often take from prior copywritten material without any sort of reimbursement for the copywrite holder. It is simply unfair to allow those using AI to profit off of other peoples work. One cannot copywrite something a computer made, because computers are not sentient to make anything unique.
