There has to be a line with AI because if a person blatantly plagiarizes other people&#39;s work, it will likely only affect a handful of creators because that&#39;s all a human has the capacity to draw from, and you can go to the plagiarizer and say &quot;Hey, you should know better, but you did that on purpose.&quot; An AI, on the other hand, can rip whole pieces or aspects from a hundred creators at once and if any one of them speak up about it then the accusation becomes &quot;Well you, the creator, should have done something to keep AI from stealing your work, because all it&#39;s doing is looking for keywords and doesn&#39;t know any better.&quot; On top of that, if the person who put those keywords into the AI then decides to copyright the created work, they can turn around and tell the original creators &quot;Hey, this is too close to something I have claim to, you need to stop.&quot; It will most of all hurt starting creators who post their work online looking for people to support them or sponsor them, and who can&#39;t afford to copyright their work or who mostly produce fanworks that they can&#39;t copyright, but AI can still copy their art style or take sections of their writing and change the names. You can&#39;t ask every household to child-proof their homes in case a giant toddler breaks in to steal their stuff, and thus creators shouldn&#39;t have to AI-proof their work in case some new AI tries to scrape their art. The giant toddler (untested and unregulated technology) should not be loose in the first place.
