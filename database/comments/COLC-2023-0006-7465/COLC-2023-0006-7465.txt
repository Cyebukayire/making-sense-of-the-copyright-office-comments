While AI and LLMs claim &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo; and &lsquo;learning&rsquo;, they have in fact achieved little more than the egregious theft of copyrighted materials from authors and creatives across every genre, subject, and category of creative work in the visual and written arts. This new technology requires a new look at the ways that copyright law can best protect creators and their work from abuse and misappropriation in the ever-evolving technological landscape of our lives. <br/>The internet itself is essentially a utility, a necessity for daily life activities as basic as paying bills, making purchases, or applying for jobs. For objects like books and artwork, it is a place for creators and companies to market, sell, share, and distribute their work. As evidenced by the leak of the Books3 list of over 180,000 books scraped from online sources and used to train language models, AI companies also consider it a source of free content, eliding copyright concerns for their own convenience. Justifiably, many authors who have had their work taken without their knowledge or consent consider this action a wholesale theft, and object to the use of their work for activities in which they cannot give approval or refusal.<br/>Since copyright law is intended to protect the rights of the author/creator to publish or permit the publishing of their creative work, a hard look needs to be taken at the way in which AI and LLMs have commandeered these vast quantities of copyrighted material for their own uses and how to prevent this from occurring again. A closer examination of how the models which comprise these new technologies are created would be a useful start, along with oversight of the process by the copyright office or another governmental body, regulation as to what can and cannot be permitted into these models, and removal of any and all copyrighted materials from these models, even if that means such models need to be rebuilt from the ground up with only author- or creator-approved materials included. <br/>The fact that such technology was built without regulation or restriction in the first place is concerning in terms of the free reign it suggests large corporations and bad actors may have to scrape data from the internet and use it as they will. While other forms of data, such as personal information, are outside of the scope of this study, these are concerns that require an equal amount of attention in the future if internet users&mdash;according to the Pew Research Center, 93% of Americans as of 2023&mdash;are to be protected from predatory or unwanted uses of their data.<br/>While the Books3 list has been made public, it is not the only training set of written material which has been used to train language models, and the sources behind visual art models remain secret, leaving visual artists often without solid proof of the illicit utilization of their work, despite the evidence of the output of these models. To allow creators to know if their copyright has been violated, pressure must be put on all the builders of these models to ensure that the content which comprises them is published, thus allowing creators to take the next steps in reclaiming their rights to their work.<br/>AI content is likely to be used in some places to replace actual writers in the near future; however, many publishers have expressed no interest whatsoever in publishing this content. Transparency over whether articles or other online content have been sourced from AI would be a next step toward allowing authors, publishers, and readers alike to understand what they are consuming, and to maintain the integrity of the creative process and the value of human creative work that continues to be produced. Attempts to pass off AI content as human writing is a deception that should not be allowed to stand any more than the obfuscation of which human-written and -created works have been scraped to make the creation of this content possible.<br/>If AI is to exist as a tool in our present and future, it must be developed in such a way as to serve the needs of any and all individuals who may wish to use it, rather than to steal from many, as it currently does, without demonstrating in its output where its content is sourced from. The Copyright Office must take a keen and active interest in correcting this sweeping breach of copyright law, in assisting and defending the creators whose rights have been violated, and must move to prevent something like this from the realm of possibility again. <br/>
