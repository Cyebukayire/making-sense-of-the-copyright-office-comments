I believe an AI program using data from copyrighted works without permission is absolutely copyright infringement. Fraudsters have used AI to great success to imitate the art of others (illustrations, writing, etc) and pass it off as originals to great monetary gain. AI that can be trained on artistic work without the artist&#39;s permission opens the floodgates to incredibly easy imitations of your work that directly and negatively impact the artist. Works are now associated with the artist&#39;s name that they never made, channeling money away from the artist and to the frauds.<br/>AI image generation is a particularly dangerous technology in relation to non-consensual pornography. An image of any person (of any age) on the internet can be turned into pornography in mere seconds and spread instantaneously, causing direct and irreparable harm to the subject of the falsified picture. The victim now has to deal with the fallout for the rest of their lives; it affects their relationships, their job prospects, their ability to hold public office. It is an incredible weapon that can be wielded by anyone with an internet connection.
