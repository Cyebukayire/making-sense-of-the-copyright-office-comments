I believe AI can be very harmful for a number of reasons, including theft (learning from writing/artwork without creator permission) and misinformation (spreading false info and/or creating fake authors, or using existing authors without consent). Anything that either learns from someone else&#39;s property without their consent, or claims to be made by them when it isn&#39;t, should violate copyright law.
