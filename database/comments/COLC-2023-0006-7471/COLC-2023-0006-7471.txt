The flagrant and unchecked use of artificially generated works of art, visual or otherwise, is produced by the scraping and ideological theft of works done by actual human artists, living or deceased, and is a clear violation of any copyright they may already have obtained on their own works. Artificial intelligences, and the works they produce, are a threat to any and every working artist in every industry across the globe. Not only do AI works undervalue the accomplishments of human artistic achievement over centuries, but also stands to halt further growth from here on. I believe that AI works should not now, or ever, be allowed to be given the legal protection of copyright - more especially because each piece of work its algorithms are based upon has been stolen by the original creator without consent, payment, or due credit.
