I am a librarian with an interest in copyright, publishing, and knowledge creation. From my perspective, I believe that the currently, though recently, established precedent, i.e., that works created using generative AI cannot be protected by copyright due to a lack of human authorship, is important to uphold. This decision at its core, maintains the spirit of the very idea of copyright, helping to protect the livelihoods of human authors by effectively reducing the market for work created through the use of generative AI.<br/>I also believe that, if this precedent is maintained, it can strengthen the argument that the use of aggregated works in datasets used to develop genAI tools is a fair use under current copyright law. That is, if AI-generated works are significantly less able to damage the market value of human-created copyrighted works, a fair use argument may be made that these tools may be trained on existing works by human creators. It may also be reasonable to impose further restrictions on how existing copyrighted works may be used in these datasets using the same standards that apply to human users under fair use&mdash;that, for example, only a small amount of a whole work may be used in such datasets.<br/>If an agreement cannot be reached over whether the use of copyrighted works in aggregate constitutes fair use, it will likely be important to allow copyright owners to explicitly restrict the use of their works for the development of AI tools, by means of something like machine-readable metadata that can indicate to aggregators that a particular work should be excluded from their collection of data. While this is a technical issue as much as a legal one, it would be important (in the case that fair use cannot be established) to allow copyright owners to maintain their currently upheld, exclusive rights to reproduce, redistribute, and create derivative works from their own copyrighted material.
