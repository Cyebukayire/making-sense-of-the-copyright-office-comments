As an independent game developer and software engineer, I believe that AI should be able to use copyrighted content without permission. However, the outputs of the AI should not be copyrightable. Copyright currently is overpowered due to lobbying (see the book Free Culture by Lawrence Lessig), and less restrictions on AI would serve to weaken the power of copyright, thus promoting the free spread of ideas and culture.
