Please regulate AI creations to protect individual artists. Do not allow corporations to use AI in place of or to augment new or existing IP. Require individual artists to be in the loop and compensated for their contributions. Do not allow AI creations to be copyrighted by corporations. Do not allow AI models to be copyrighted by corporations. Do not allow corporations to train AI without compensating the originators of the art. If the art is in public domain, make them compensate through taxes for access for that material. Force the corporations to make their AI models and training data traceable and verifiable to 3rd parties and the public. Do not allow corporations to use AI and then simply have an individual contributing artist sign off on it as their creation. The artist should have to substantially contribute changes to the AI output to get copyright. Furthermore, beyond AI, please shorten the period that copyright protection lasts. Protections should last no longer than patents do. Thank you, John S.
