Hello, thank you for opening up this inquiry and for reading my comment. I am of the opinion that generative AI should not be considered copyrightable. There should be regulatory laws in place to protect human artists from having their IP infringed upon by generative AI.<br/><br/>I first claim that works created by generative AI should not be considered copyrightable because it requires no work done by the &ldquo;author,&rdquo; who in this case would be the person writing the prompt the AI will attempt to fulfill. The Patent Office&rsquo;s website (https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/copyright-policy/copyright-basics) opens with the statement, &ldquo;Copyright is a form of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship.&rdquo; &ldquo;Original&rdquo; would be the key word in this instance. &ldquo;Original&rdquo; is defined by Merriam-Webster as &ldquo;not secondary, derivative, or iterative&rdquo; and &ldquo;independant and creative in thought and action.&rdquo; Generative AI regurgitates what it has seen before in a vaguely new order. This is derivative (by Merriam-Webster: &ldquo;having parts that originate from another source&rdquo;). Therefore, the products of a generated AI prompt cannot be considered to be copyrightable intellectual property in its own right. It may be considered a derivative work and therefore eligible to receive copyright, unless the works it used to create its derivative works were obtained illegally. This will be expanded on in a later section. For this section, I wish to show from the International Trade Administration (https://www.trade.gov/protect-intellectual-property) their definition of intellectual property: &ldquo;Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind: inventions; literary and artistic works, and symbols, images, names and logos used in commerce.&rdquo; Because generative AI relies on prompts to produce a literary or artistic work rather than using the mind to create&ndash; the mind comes up with an order, but does not do the creation itself. To use a real-life analog, we look at a shop that sells items with customizations. A customer gives input as to what they want the final product to look like, but they do not do the work in producing the item, the seller does. Therefore, the customer should not get the credit for the creation of the item. Likewise, the prompt, being a creation of the mind, may be considered intellectual property but the actual generation by the AI may not. Another example of this may be blazons used in heraldry. The achievement granted to a person is not the artwork depicting the blazon, a statement describing what the arms should look like, but the blazon itself. Similarly, the prompt (blazon) is what is created through the mind and is original, not the work generated by AI (coat of arms). I leave definitions with a sentence taken from Cornell Law&rsquo;s website (https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intellectual_property): &ldquo;Intellectual property (I.P. or IP) is a type of property encompassing the products of original human thought.&rdquo; &ldquo;Human&rdquo; is the key word here. The author is not the one creating the work, so the author cannot claim copyright for the intellectual property produced by the generative AI. I want to bring up a 2022 registration application by the Office as precedence. The human input was deemed copyrightable, but not the product of the generative AI. I believe this to be a wise ruling.<br/><br/>My comment appears to have exceeded character limits, so if it is alright I will continue in more comments. Thank you for your consideration.
