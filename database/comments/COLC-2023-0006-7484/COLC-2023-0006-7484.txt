While I can believe there can be some practical and ethical uses of AI, using it to replace creatives like artists, writers, actors, and voice actors is absolutely infuriating, and should not be allowed. Especially when the one replacing them is a multimillion dollar corporation like Disney for fucks sake.<br/>This needs to be regulated as soon as possible to protect the rights and careers of the people who create the things I love, and the things I want to voice in myself.
