Artificial Intelligence, specifically AI-generated images (e.g. what can be found in Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.), should generally not be considered able to be copyrighted for the sole reasons that a) these images are composites of other existing images that often come from third party sources to train the AI program, b) a person can edit a prompt to manipulate what is generated, the person does not create the image outright, and c) a person who wishes to copyright an AI-generated image cannot prohibit the program they use from creating a very similar or near-identical image on someone else&rsquo;s device/application. <br/><br/>The only exception that could allow copyrightability is when a person trains an AI program using only original images that they themselves have produced, whether they be photographs, paintings, etc. <br/><br/>This is not comparable to other composite art forms like collages, because collages are still created by human beings. I am unaware of the copyright laws surrounding composite art mediums such as these, but AI generated images should not have the same level of protection as them.
