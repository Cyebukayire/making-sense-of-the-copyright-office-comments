As an artist, I am not COMPLETELY opposed to AI technology. However, many artists would agree with me in saying that it is something that desperately needs to be regulated. As of now, most sites for generating AI images use various artworks from all over the internet, including those that are copyrighted. This is not only copyright infringement, but also incredibly disrespectful to us artists. AI should only be trained on copyright/royalty free material.
