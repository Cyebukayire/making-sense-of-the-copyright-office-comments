The attached PDF file captures the GenAI (ChatGPT) response to the prompt: &quot;Taking a futuristic timeline of 10 years in US Copyright law to include the copyright of output GenAI&quot;.  The resulting GenAI generated reponse is well balanced and provides insights on this complex issue. I propose the US Copyright Office comment reviewers to review the attached comment file and enumerate how many many other comments received can be mapped back to this one comment file. A more interesting case is to highlight if the attached comment file presents options not conceived or presented by other comment contributors.
