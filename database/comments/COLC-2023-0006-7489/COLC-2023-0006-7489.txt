I personally have no grievance against AI as a means of testing the limits of what a computer is capable of generating. However, there are those that use AI as a means of producing content that they claim is theirs and even those that make money off of this. I am sickened that there are people in the world that are capable of abusing this technology and even more disgusted that there are no real regulations to keep this in check. There is no easy answer to this problem; however one of the simplest is to remove AI capabilities from easy-to-obtain sources. In a study, an AI has no place replicating or reciting information in an environment meant for research. In art, an AI has no place creating simulated artwork where people that actually learned, practiced and honed their skills- people that make a living off of their own talents- only to have a program &quot;do what they can do but cheaper&quot;. And in a movie making industry, it is irredeemable to allow AI to replicate voices of people that have passed away, as it is disgraceful and goes without consent of the person(s) involved, and offers no way to compensate the families of those whose voices were used. All in all, AI is slowly replacing/removing jobs from people who actually work hard and use their talents, where a program just needs to be told certain parameters to act inside of and will &quot;simulate&quot; that hard work.
