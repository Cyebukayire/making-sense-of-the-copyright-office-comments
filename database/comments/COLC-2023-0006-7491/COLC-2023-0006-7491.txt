Works generated using AI that was trained on other people&#39;s work should not be copyrightable. <br/><br/>&quot;AI&quot; is a misnomer for what these programs are. They should really be referred to as large language models, or LLMs. AI isn&#39;t intelligence at all. It doesn&#39;t think and it certainly isn&#39;t creative; it regurgitates what it&#39;s been fed. That&#39;s not what copyright was intended to encourage.<br/><br/>Furthermore, companies are already using LLMs to replace human writers, some of whom have no doubt had their own writing used to train the LLMs. The net effect is to make it more difficult for humans to create by taking away a source of income&mdash;again, the opposite of what copyright was intended to do. Denying copyright to LLM-generated works would help mitigate this effect.
