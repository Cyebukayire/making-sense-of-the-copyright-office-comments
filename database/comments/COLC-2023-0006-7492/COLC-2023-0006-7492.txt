To whom it may concern,<br/><br/>I would like to share my thoughts on the matter of AI as it relates to copyright in four points.<br/><br/>1. Usage of copyrighted materials: On this matter I&#39;m of the opinion that, as AI is very much intended by several entities currently creating them to be a service or product for sale (i.e. Microsoft with ChatGPT), that they require the permission of copyright holders for the development of their saleable product.<br/><br/>2. Whether AI-written materials are copyrightable: On this matter, as an author myself I am vehemently opposed to the notion a machine which uses datasets in conjunction with a bit of applied linear algebra to refactor those datasets can constitute a copyrightable work. The monkeys operating these typewriters are well trained compared to their forebearers, but the very volume of material they can put out at the click of a button beggars belief. The operator is pulling the lever on a lottery machine time and time again and hoping what comes out tickles their fancy. That the lever is able to guide the roll somewhat does not change the underlying nature of the game they seek to play.<br/><br/>3. Liability of infringement on copyrighted material by AI: I am of the opinion that an infringement of copyright is the same no matter the source, be it person or AI, but that unlike a person who can only output so much material in a given time-frame, an AI is capable of much greater volumes. It should thus be treated as an actor capable of abusing copyright at a large scale and one well designed to obscure that fact behind topical alterations to the copyrighted material and its intrinsic black-box design.<br/><br/>4. The Human Factor: Art is a human endeavor. It has been since time immemorial. Tools help us create art, but AI is increasingly posed as a device which can make it wholesale. In a society such as ours where time is money, AI could very well destroy whole livelihoods for no gain other than that of shareholders. It would change the nature of art as it is perceived by many and I cannot help but think in such headwinds that there would simply be less art made by humans. This, to me personally, would be a tragedy of the highest order.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
