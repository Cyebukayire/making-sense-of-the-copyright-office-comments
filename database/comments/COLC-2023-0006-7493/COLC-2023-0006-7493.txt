I really do believe that AI art should not be copyrightable. AI simply scrapes images from online sources or sources that anyone feeds into it. Those sources could come from anywhere on the web without the artists permission to be used in AI training! because AI is simply an amalgamation of hundreds or thousands of different images you can&#39;t rightfully copyright it. Think of the countless artists whose works will be used and stolen without rightful credit or recompense.
