I do not support allowing AI-generated work to be protected by copyright. <br/><br/>It is nearly impossible to determine whether an AI model has used copyrighted work without permission in its generation process. Allowing subsequently-generated works to be copyrighted would itself be an avenue for indirect infringement with impunity. Numerous artists have already had their work taken, run through generated models, and republished for sale on popular websites like Adobe Stock.<br/><br/>See:<br/>https://twitter.com/kemar74/status/1692456947948134783<br/>https://twitter.com/victongai/status/1691124281718267904<br/>https://twitter.com/loishh/status/1692086151039832231<br/><br/>A generative model does not &quot;learn&quot; in the way a human does (see https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1563153088470749196 from a Google DeepMind researcher). It builds a model from a database in a manner entirely alien to human thinking. We should protect human creativity -- it is a critical element of our culture and part of our identity as a species. Allowing generated models to disenfranchise artists (while using their own works against them) would be appalling.
