As a professional artist in the entertainment industry, the use of generative AI technology presents an existential threat to my livelihood and the livelihood of my friends and peers in the industry today. Not only is it a needlessly disruptive element that can potentially render my career obsolete, it does so by scraping, re-using, and repackaging my artwork and the artwork of every working creative in a non-consensual manner. Companies and organizations that use GAI tech to repackage artwork by referencing, scraping, and kit bashing artwork from artists without their permission are engaging in art theft. This matter is no different than when an individual downloads or sells an unauthorized copy or bootleg of a film without the film distributor or studios permission, making a profit off someone else&#39;s hard work without their express permission. I know that there is a place for this technology, and that it may yet bear fruitful innovation in all facets of society. But as to where the technology stands now, it presents a massive threat to a whole industry of creatives that have labored most of their adult lives to attain the careers they have now; careers that their livelihoods depend on. There must be an inquiry into the use of GAI tech in the entertainment industry, so that there may be safeguards and regulations that prevent the egregious copyright and privacy infringements that the use of GAI tech potentially imposes in this industry. Not doing so will impose a needless and ironic existential threat that will upend the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of working creatives today.
