Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the use of AI in our copyright law. As this new technology enters into our creative world, I am excited to see how we regulate the use and effect on the musical world. For context, I am a professional songwriter and artist based in Nashville. I also work for a publisher overseeing multiple publishing catalogs and label clients. I am approaching the use of AI as a creative and administrative position within the arts community. But unlike many, I am not afraid or anti using AI in the creative world. I think AI is a wonderful new tool for creatives, same as Pro Tools, metronomes, rhyme zone, thesauruses, etc. However, I want the copyright office to understand that no tool can operate better than its human master wielding it. Just as there are great songs made in Pro Tools daily, there are also bad songs created in Pro Tools daily and the same will be said for AI. <br/><br/>Therefore, I propose that AI does not affect the percentage owned by the human creators of the music. Regardless of if AI is used, the songwriters who wrote the song should still own the song. Not only because they wield the tool, but also because AI cannot create anything by itself. It can only use data of what other songwriters have already created, making every work by AI a derivative of someone&#39;s else&#39;s creation and not an original piece of art itself.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the copyright office needs to understand the power of protecting creative jobs. Allowing AI to be a tool that creates free music without paying the artist whose music it is simply replicating will destroy our creatives who have jobs in sync. Imagine the company who wants to make a commercial using a Taylor Swift song but they do not want to pay the money to Taylor Swift to use her song. So they ask AI to make a song in the likeness of Taylor Swift to be able to use that music for free. This may not seem like a big issue for a major artist like Taylor, but this would be catastrophic to the indie artist you have never heard of who is making their living off of sync music. Allowing AI the freedom to create non-royalty based music would eliminate the sync industry. <br/><br/>Making AI the invisible fifth writer in the room will also discourage songwriters to explore the tool. They will be set up to see AI as the enemy and be in competition with AI instead of free to explore how it can enhance their creativity. The only way that AI can be a productive and useful tool in the creative world is for it to not negatively impact the actual creator&#39;s daily life and career. A creative will be excited to explore new tools and will know the best way to yield it. Let&#39;s let them decide how and when AI should be used in the songwriting communities without negatively impacting how they pay their mortgage.<br/><br/>And for my final point, I am excited about AI but let&#39;s also remember that AI will never create a Tom Waits, Hamilton, Taylor Swift, Michael Jackson, or any other artist or piece of music that is truly original. Because AI is not original. It is a derivative of what and who has come before it. So let&#39;s protect the artists, songwriters, and creators who are part of the long lineage that has led to this point in technology. And let&#39;s set them up well to be able to explore the use of this new technology to be able to expand our art and music into the next decade.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time. <br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Emily Myers
