As an artist and creative, I feel increasingly threatened by AI, not only from the natural fear of replacement, but because I feel my work is endangered. AI image generation, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;AI art&rdquo;, doesn&#39;t come from thin air. It&#39;s rooted in thousands of pieces that take hours of effort of real, human artists; and often, they are used without permission from the creators, either coming from search browsers or from re-uploads by third parties. Considering this, it&#39;s hard to verify where our art is being used, specially for individual, freelance artists like myself. Furthermore, once they are put into the AI generation system, the machine learning threatens the uniqueness and likeness of an art style or artwork, opening the gates for replicas to be displayed without the author&#39;s knowledge or consent. Even more importantly, this puts income for artists at risk: if a free AI learns to replicate their art style, potential clients could be drawn to auto-generating these images instead of paying the actual artist for their work. All of this without considering the troublesome effects of the generated results themselves. Many individuals today claim themselves to be &ldquo;AI artists&rdquo;, users that prompt the technologies to generate images and claim them as their own work, despite the high chances of the images just being an alterated version of preexisting artwork by uncredited artists. Some of these users have also taken to sell these results, which again, puts the original creators at risk. I, and the art community as a whole, beg for the United States Government to protect the rights we hold over our work, and prevent it from being used in AI image generation without our consent.
