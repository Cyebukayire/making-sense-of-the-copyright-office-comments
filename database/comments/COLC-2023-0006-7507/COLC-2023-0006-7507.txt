As a working freelance artist I wanted to comment on the four issues put forward. I believe there is no greater issue that threatens the very core of copyright protections then AI-Models if allowed to continue unhampered as they are.<br/><br/>1) It is undeniable that copyrighted works have been used to train AI models that are for-profit. AI companies make their money off using copyrighted works that without- would be severely hampered. This should be illegal. The companies using these AI-models have also not fully disclosed their use of copyrighted works- there is no accountability in what they use. Copyrighted work should not be able to be used in training a direct competition and facsimile of the copyrighted work. This severely weakens copyright protections across the board. AI-models should be required to verify and use works that are public domain.<br/><br/>2) Seeing that AI models do not use human input- they should be denied copyright as they have been in the past. Given the sheer bulk of images AI can produce- it would immediately create a gold-rush of producing millions of AI-generated materials and trying to copyright every idea under the sun. Secondly if AI models are filled with copyrighted works that should be a further concern to giving AI generated material copyright. Many original copyrights would certainly be infringed upon and put a massive burden on those trying to defend their copyright.<br/><br/>3) Any AI-model or company producing works infringing on copyright should be held liable. Companies KNOW they are using copyrighted works and yet want to pass the buck off to the users- saying it&#39;s THEIR responsibility. The problem is it is an intrinsic part of the AI-models to use copyrighted work- hence they should be held liable for any infringement there product produces.<br/><br/>4) The current state of AI models legislation allows them to input all of an artists works and produce something resembling a replica. Because there is not protection against this stealing of copyrighted work and imputing it into a model this puts any artist or creator in a severely dangerous position. Furthermore- if copyright was ever given to AI produced work- it would allow AI models to input all of the artists work and then produce a direct copyrightable competition to that artist. It would effectively destroy copyright. Particularly given the scale at which AI material can be produced. I believe allowing this would effectively destroy large swathes of the art industry by weakening copyright protections.<br/><br/>Thank you
