The main thing that concerns me with AI art is how businesses like Midjourney have scraped the internet for millions of published images to train their AI, especially when they use it to turn a profit.<br/><br/>It&#39;s already illegal to monetarily benefit off someone else&#39;s copyrighted work unless you have the proper rights for it, I don&#39;t think it should be any different for AI. I don&#39;t think any argument or comparison can deny the fact that you have to feed the artwork to the AI. <br/><br/>I think there should be some sort of regulation put in place to protect artists&#39; work from being used to train AI without their consent. It might be hard to enforce, but it could at least create a way for artists to protect their work. <br/><br/>
