AI Machine Learning Artworks and Creative Endeavours are purely and entirely theft from nonconsenting or unwilling artists and creators. <br/><br/>For AI creations to be classified as ethical or anything but theft, it must be trained on an opt-in database created by artists.<br/><br/>This would be ethical, but ultimately pointless. Creative Endeavours are precisely that, creative. An AI, while impressive, cannot engage in any creative production as they do not think, learn, or have memories in which to create context. It is simply garbled mess that looks appealing, no matter how convincing it looks.
