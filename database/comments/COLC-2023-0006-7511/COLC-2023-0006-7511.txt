Software is not human. It can only simulate and pretend to be human. Software can be written using all sort of techniques which can be simplistic or very complicated and clever. No matter the sophistication of the methods, computer generated content is only the output of parroting actual humans. The rules that would need to be developed to regulate when computer generated content was sufficiently unique to be granted copyright protection would have to be so complex that it would be unlikely that it could be interpreted or judged consistently: the rules themself would be almost meaningless in a room full of lawyers. Software is math: always has been and always will be. Neither software nor its outputs should ever fall under copyright.
