I am someone who is deeply concerned about the impact machine learning algorithms will have on the livelihoods of my artist friends. I strongly believe that the model of mass scraping training data from all over the internet is deeply unethical. If artists wish to submit their artwork for machine learning algorithms, they should explicitly opt-in. As it stands, I can only see the future of utilizing machine learning in commercial ventures being used to undercut artists or to remove them from the process entirely unless action is taken to protect their intellectual properties. While I will not decry those who wish to use machine learning algorithms to supplement the creative process, it must be done through ethically sourced training data, whether that is their own work or work from those they have explicit permission from. <br/><br/>If the current free for all state is left to persist, then the quality of the artwork we have in our day to day lives will only worsen. Generative image programs are already degradation in quality as they train themselves on their own outputs, but facts like that would hardly matter to a corporation trying to find every single cent to cut, no matter the impact on the end product. Whether it is text, artwork, voiceover, etc., it&#39;s the artists who created the training data that machine learning algorithms rely on in the first place, and it is now them who are at risk of being forced into the shadows, their voices never to be heard from again. For the sake of our culture, I strongly believe we need to protect the rights and dignity of artists everywhere in order to leave a positive lasting legacy for our art in the future.
