I&rsquo;m not in favor of copyright being extended to AI generated works. From a layperson&rsquo;s perspective, I think that the highest potential that the systems commonly called &ldquo;AI&rdquo; can have in creative media is as one of many tools a human being or team of human beings use(s) in the creative process (for example, a writer creating something of a visual &ldquo;scratch track&rdquo; to serve as reference material for a collaborating illustrator as that writer builds the skill of effectively describing the visuals they want to accompany their words.) In the absence of human labor beyond telling a program what sort of thing they&rsquo;d like to see generated, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible for someone to legitimately own the ensuing work.
