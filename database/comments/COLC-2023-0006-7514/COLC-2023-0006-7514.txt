Hello. I personally think subjecting artificial intelligence to copyright laws would ultimately harm freedom of speech and creativity. Artificial intelligence has potential for a wide range of creative expression due to it&#39;s lack of limitations that a human is subject to. Limiting that would ultimately harm the many impressive works of art it is capable of, has produced, and can improve upon in the future.<br/>I also believe it would harm freedom of speech as well as it has been used in expression of opinions and beliefs from large to small scales. Moderation of internet users and what they are allowed to say has become heavy over the years and limiting artificial intelligence would serve to only further limit what people are allowed to say. If what people are allowed to say is limited then it could influence what people are allowed to think which could cause severe consequences in culture and even reasonable behavior.<br/><br/>It is my firm belief that artificial intelligence should not be subject to copyright laws and it is my sincerest hope that it is allowed the freedom it needs for only then does it flourish.<br/>Thank you for your time.
