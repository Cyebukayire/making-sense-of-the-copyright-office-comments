Regarding AI and copyrighted material. The most significant factors to take into consideration when training AI models is the consent of the original creators of the materials being used to train the AI, as well as the copyright status of the materials. <br/>If the original author/ artist/ creator of the materials has explicitly stayed they do not give consent for their materials to be used to train AI, then there needs to be some sort of protection to prevent that consent from being violated. Some sort of consequence that will prevent their materials from being used in ways they don&#39;t approve. <br/>Similarly there should be protections for materials that have already been copyrighted. If not, what&#39;s to prevent a company taking a competitors materials, feeding it into an AI and marketing the results as their own? <br/><br/>And for many individuals their face, their own likeness is at stake, and as it currently stands, it feels there is little to prevent companies from using AI use someone&#39;s likeness in a way they did not consent to. To endorse a product they don&#39;t actually endorse. <br/>Or to relay a message they don&#39;t beleive in. <br/>Ultimately, the intellectual property of both the individual creator and companies need to be protected. <br/>
