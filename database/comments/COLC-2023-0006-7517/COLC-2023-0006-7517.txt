Allowing AI to run rampant will cause horrific and irreversible damage to our society, culture, and way of living. Unless you want another attempted coup, don&#39;t allow robots to take the jobs that feed countless families. Don&#39;t let the art field get destroyed, AI art is a soulless abomination. Why should I be bothered to look at, or read something that someone else couldn&#39;t be bothered to make or write?
