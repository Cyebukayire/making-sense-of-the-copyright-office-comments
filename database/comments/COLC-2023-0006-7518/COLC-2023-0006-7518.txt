I am a professional graphic designer and illustrator and a hobbyist writer and artist. As such, my opinions on AI technology as a professional deal mostly with the human authorship question (question 18) and implications for the industry (question 2), while my opinions as an artist deal primarily with fair use and consent on training material (questions 8 and 9)<br/><br/>The copyright office&rsquo;s current trajectory on human authorship and generative AI is in alignment with my own understanding of copyright law and established precedent. I am not a lawyer nor otherwise an expert, but I do have the understanding required of a professional in a creative field. As for determining whether the output of an AI could be considered human-authored, I do not believe it could be, at least not short of a user having completely created both the algorithm and all training data entirely by themselves and having complete control of all variables. That case might be human authored, but I do not think any of the existing tools (or any that will launch in the near future) could fulfill those criteria.<br/><br/>As a designer in the industry, I believe there are a number of unique issues in my sector. The simplest one is the question of unmarked AI-generated stock art. I fear that the current proliferation such pieces could render designers unknowingly unable to protect their own work from being plagiarized when standard licenses are not binding on the elements without human authorship. Most major stockphoto repositories don&rsquo;t currently allow filtering to remove AI-generated search results, which is highly concerning when the legal status of AI-generated images is still uncertain.<br/><br/>The larger and far more complicated issues in my industry sector are of course competition and the adoption of AI tools as standards. I do not have a personal comment on the later, but the former I will elaborate on in the context of fair use below.<br/><br/>Put simply, I cannot imagine any case where using uncompensated, unnotified copyrighted works as training material for commercial AI could be considered fair use. The spirit of fair use doctrine protects transformative, non commercial, and non competing use of material. AI (especially generative AI) is intended to compete commercially with (and even replace) the very human authors it draws its training from, often without significant transformation. While noncommercial AI may fall into a gray area I do not have answers for, any AI intended for monetization or adapted for monetization does not, and to me seems to be plainly infringing.<br/><br/>When it comes to opt-in vs opt-out, I have a personal example to offer: I have posted creative hobby work to The Organization for Transformative Work&rsquo;s project &ldquo;Archive of Our Own&rdquo; which was scraped by common crawl and included in the training data for ChatGPT (established by several news sources and remarked upon by the OTW here: https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/25888) This happened before anyone could reasonably be expected to know about scraping or to apply any opt-out measures. Certain measures have now been applied, but there is no extracting the data from the models, and as such an archive&rsquo;s worth of explicitly noncommercial works (works which themselves fall under fair use) have been exploited for commercial purposes. This example shows that opt-out will never be sufficient when it comes to automatic web crawlers and scraping&mdash;the conditions of technology and the internet change too quickly, and any opt-out system will lag far, far behind the collection of the data, essentially stripping all meaning from the choice to opt-out. By necessity any and all future datasets must be collected on an opt-in basis.
