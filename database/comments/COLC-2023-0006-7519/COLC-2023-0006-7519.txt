Question 1:<br/><br/>As a writer myself, I am concerned about the issue of copyright infringement with AI-generated work because when I post my work on the internet I should &ndash; depending on the platform &ndash; have full-rights to that work which do not include it being used for AI-purposes without my consent &ndash; especially when companies profit off of the work of artists and writers through using their work for the purpose of training AI. I know that writers and other artists can become inspired by each other&rsquo;s work, and even attempt to mimic styles. While this may seem similar to AI, the fact is that AI is not human and does not (or cannot) give credit where it is due, whether as inspiration or imitation. There have been cases where AI has not simply drawn inspiration from works that it has been fed, but has regurgitated them verbatim and passed it off as original content. Many copyright infringement lines are drawn when another person a) passes off someone else&rsquo;s work as their own and b) profits off of this work. Because AI and AI companies do not give proper credit to the artists and writers they use to generate material, and then profit off of said material, they are essentially stealing work, passing it off as &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; and &ldquo;original&rdquo; content, and making money off of that work. The work they are feeding is someone&rsquo;s intellectual property and AI is violating their right by scraping it from the internet and using it for themselves without permission. We don&rsquo;t allow people writing research papers to use direct quotes from other sources without following strict guidelines which give proper credit to the original source, so why should AI be exempt from this practice? I believe there needs to be better transparency around what materials AI is being fed to generate materials, and there needs to be a system for proper citation of materials used from other sources and, where applicable, compensation provided. I do not believe AI work should be copyrightable if it is solely generated from other sources, without human input, and without credit to the human sources which generated the initial material. <br/><br/>Question 5:<br/><br/>New legislation is warranted to address generative AI-related copyright issues because of the profit motive of companies that develop generative AI programs. There needs to be legislation which holds companies accountable for providing transparency in which works are used in AI training and providing compensation to the authors of those works when the generated material makes money off of using their work. In addition, legislation should require appropriate disclosure of AI-generated materials, particularly on social media platforms, to prevent and limit the spread of false information which may have harmful impacts.<br/><br/>Question 28:<br/><br/>AI material should be labelled as such. In an internet environment already rife with disinformation and misinformation, AI material will increasingly become more realistic and can easily be spread around as false information. This should apply to photos, artwork, music and voices, and all types of writing. AI material can do substantial harm in ways from interpersonal to international, as false information about international political events &ndash; such as terrorist attacks or nuclear war &ndash; can create panic which poses a threat to public safety. Having AI material labelled as such may prevent any physical injuries or emotional distress before they have a chance to occur. The requirement should apply to all works which use AI, and responsibility should be spread across different mechanisms. Host sites should play a part in requiring identification; the sites which allow users to generate AI should require it before work can be downloaded and/or exported, perhaps with a watermark of some sort. It should be enforceable by government regulations to prevent the spread of misinformation or disinformation through such materials.
