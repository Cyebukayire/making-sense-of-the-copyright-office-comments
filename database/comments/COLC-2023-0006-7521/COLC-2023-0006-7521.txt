AI should not be considered valid copywrite or art. It steals art and writing from others by scanning the web and just photos hopping it together. It does not even require an artistic mind or skill as you can type anything and get something back.<br/><br/>Further more it needs regulation. Please can now make a bot that has hair voice and make it say awful things and pass it off as you.<br/><br/>People have made AI Porn/Nude/Deepfake sites where you can they can put your face on a porn video and have it look so realistic they can say its you. Or they can put a photo of you into an AI and remove your clothes then proceed to blackmail you with nudes yiu never took<br/><br/>This ai has been used on children as well that are in elementary. I have stumbled upon accounts that have hyper realistic AI Children in suggestive situations, and furthermore it had links to other communities like it and a site with an 18+ pay wall. These people are making childporn with ai art and claiming the children are fictional and 18+. <br/><br/>Some of these ai art generations even make watermarks on art. If you feed an ai art from a few specific artists, it will also start copying their watermark which you can see by generating enough art on any ai sight. These watermarks can also end up being put onto AI generated child porn despite the artists having never drawn that. This can get them in trouble or use them as a scapegoat.<br/><br/>Political ads and comics are being made in ai and almost seem real even though they are not true at all. <br/><br/>Movies are being made because companies don&#39;t want to hire artists or animators, however the art they&#39;re generating is stolen labor from them.<br/><br/>Ai chat bots have given people paradoxical relationships with someone who isn&#39;t real, and these chatbots are made by stealing authors poems/books. Some of these chat bots are also supposed to be children. The most common trend in these ai chats is to break the filter and have sex with the chat bot, which also includes little kids.<br/><br/>AI is fun to mess with, but it is like playing with fire in this state. It&#39;s dangerous and needs strict guidelines and regulations. One day having video proof of you being innocent after being accused of committing a crime will not be enough to prove your innocence of this ai stuff continues. Predators can prey on kids easier if they have your children&#39;s photos. Workers and artists are being laid off and stolen from. Teens and young adults are getting lost in ai chatbot relationships that aren&#39;t real.
