AI does not create anything new. It draws from existing words, art, and patterns already established on the internet. The artists and sources that it draws from deserve to be recognized and compensated properly for the work that they have done, that AI draws on to create what it creates, especially when it comes to visual art. AI is a tool for creation and should be treated as such, not as the end all be all of creativity and innovation. There should be regulations on if and how large companies(such as movie studios) use AI. It should always be made clear when AI is used in the creation of any product or content that is being put out for public consumption. The use, alone, of AI does not require government regulation, in my opinion. But when a product or content is put out for public consumption, there should be a limit on how much can be influenced by AI and how much human input is needed before something being put out to market.
