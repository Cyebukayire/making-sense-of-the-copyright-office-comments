Hello! I think that algorithm/AI based art created should be required to compensate the art that was used to train it. whether that is compensated by the engine itself or the end user that has created it may be a topic for further discussion. that said, human labor went into creating the foundational material that allowed these engines to exist. why would they not receive compensation nor acknowledgement of this?<br/><br/>15. In order to allow copyright owners to determine whether their works have been used, should developers of AI models be required to collect, retain, and disclose records regarding the materials used to train their models? Should creators of training datasets have a similar obligation?  Yes, I have to publish full datasets for groundwater models and the like. why would these commercial entities be able to scrap the entire internet for profit without even getting permission from the creator of art.
