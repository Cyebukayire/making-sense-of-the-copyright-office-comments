Artificial Intelligence is no longer merely a tool artists can use. The technology has advanced to overtake the artists&#39; themselves in a way which thwart&#39;s the inherent value of art and questions what artistry actually is. But what the question illuminates better is what artistry is not: It is not the automated synthesis of work based on data input. Regardless of the output, if that is the method of creation, it is not an artistic creation at all. Copyright is meant to protect art, not computer generated synthesis of data. So, without significant restrictions on AI in copyright law, artists and their place in society will be overrun by AI and those who seek to gain unfair economic and social advantage, all while cheapening and drowning out true art. Therefore, any work that doesn&#39;t merely use AI as a small tool, but as the generator of a substantial portion of the work itself shouldn&#39;t be eligible for copyright.
