1.  I think this technology could help assist human artists on a low budget, but the problem is that it cuts into a thriving, low-barrier-to-entry market: Art commissions. I think if people used this with training data that wasn&rsquo;t stolen (such as stock images or their own art), then it would not be as big of an issue. <br/>2.  As someone who wants to be an writer, I&rsquo;m afraid AI might occupy what is currently entry-level writing jobs.<br/>5. Yes, I think new legislation is warranted. I think that any commercially available image generator should be transparent in what images they use for training data, and should only use images that they have explicit permission to use. It&rsquo;s also important that companies like Facebook, Twitter, or art sites don&rsquo;t change their terms of service to acquire automatic rights to an artist&rsquo;s work.  <br/>9. Opt-in. It would be pretty easy to abuse an opt-out requirement&ndash;simply put up a bunch of red tape and make it a very slow process to have your art removed from training data. <br/>9.1. Yes, I think that consent should be required for all uses of an author&rsquo;s work in AI models. People being able to use others&rsquo; work for AI models drives down demand for custom commissions or other contracts.<br/>9.3  It is absolutely feasible to get consent in advance. Most likely, businesses will spring up that will pay artists to submit their work to these sets of training data. Look at the stock photo industry. Freelance photographers take photos and obtain small royalties based on downloads. It could work the same way for AI art&ndash;with artists getting a small royalty when their work is used in a generated image.<br/>9.4 I think violators should be fined small amounts of money that increase exponentially with the number of infringements. Small-time hobbyists will be discouraged through what is essentially fines for petty theft. Large corporations will be discouraged from abusing meager fines that get written off as the cost of doing business. <br/>9.5 I think that depends on whether or not the artist permits it in the sale contract. <br/>10.2 Stock photo sites already license images from photographers and artists on a mass scale, all of whom opt-in to licensing their work in exchange for small royalty fees whenever their work is used. These systems already exist, so it is feasible. <br/>12. From what I&rsquo;ve read, current generative models make it very difficult to identify the degree to which a particular work contributes to the output of an image generator. These algorithms are made through machine learning, a trial-and-error process that&rsquo;s more akin to evolution than engineering in some ways. Often, the resulting program is poorly understood by it&rsquo;s creators. These are called &ldquo;Black Box algorithms.&rdquo; I do think the copyright office should still take steps to legislate based on the assumption that this problem will be resolved, or should be resolved.<br/>13. It is likely that within the next 10-20 years, AI systems will supplement or replace artistic jobs that are generally considered low-quality. To put the fancy language aside for a second, I&rsquo;m talking about schlock like reality TV and soap operas, factory-made romance novels and commissioned pornographic art. Where people already have low expectations, arts and media jobs will evaporate. This is a problem, because not only does that destroy jobs, these jobs are, in many ways, entry level.<br/>15. Yes, 100%.<br/>15.1 YouTube has a system in which copyrighted content is automatically flagged. A similar system could be used here. Artists could search for their art using image-search algorithms in databases of training images, which must be legally required to be publicly accessible. <br/>16. Those developing training data have an obligation to acquire consent beforehand.<br/>22. I don&rsquo;t think so. The mindset with which I approach this issue is to ensure artists are able to make money off of their work. It is to ensure our society makes creative expression a viable job, because art is one of the best things about humanity. Derivative works are art, but being able to mass-produce derivative works threatens to livelihood of these artists. <br/>25. The developer of the model&ndash;the ones who accumulate training data. <br/>28. I think that any commercially available work that includes AI art should be labeled as such, and that further detail on what AI was used for should be also be included, such as in the end credits.<br/>30. Imitations of person, especially, should require explicit permission for their likeness. I can&rsquo;t imagine the kind of havoc that could be wrought by using fabricated videos of world leaders. This needs regulation yesterday. <br/>32. I think it would be impossible to define where one person&rsquo;s style ends and another&rsquo;s begins. Training data is what should be regulated, not art style. <br/><br/>
