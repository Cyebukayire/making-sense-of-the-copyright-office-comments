I believe it is very important that artists whose works are used in training data be compensated for use of their work to train AI models. It is clear that AI models provide utility and value, and thus artists whose work helps train such models should be compensated for their contribution to this process. One concern I have is that the complexity of such AI models has grown to the point where it is easy to conceal what contributes to the final model/product, but we must ensure that this is accounted for by regulations.
