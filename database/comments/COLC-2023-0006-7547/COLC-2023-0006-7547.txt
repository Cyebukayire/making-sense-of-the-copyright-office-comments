It is my opinion that the increasing use of machine-generated art, in its various forms, represents a clear danger to artists throughout the world, and that the USA has a duty to establish strict measures to protect the rights of artists. To address the specific points raised:<br/><br/>(1) The use of existing artwork as a training data should be considered infringement, as a machine learning system cannot, by definition, apply creative processes. The scraped artwork is simply being chopped up and used wholesale. Compensation would be owed to the infringed parties in this case, and legal measures should be put into place to ensure that only artists who have provided positive assent should have their art used as training data.<br/><br/>(2) Simply feeding prompts into an algorithm does not grant one copyright over the final product, in the same way that a client who commissions an artist does not automatically receive copyright over the finished piece. As the algorithm itself cannot gain copyright protection, and as the final product will be entirely recycled from the works of human artists, there is no reason to presume that anybody would be able to gain copyright protections. I cannot conceive of any circumstances in which somebody feeding a prompt into an AI art program should receive copyright protection for the machine-generated result.<br/><br/>(3) In the case that a generative AI system would be found to have directly infringed upon an artist&#39;s copyright, liability should fall entirely upon the creators of the software rather than on the user who provided the prompt, assuming the two are not the same party.<br/><br/>(4) A false performance created by a generative AI system may not breach copyright laws, but the existence of such things has particularly concerning implications. Such systems are fallible at present, but I see no reason to presume that they will not reach the point where they could fool a majority of viewers within a short span of time. Actors, both living and dead, may have their likeness used to create performances at odds with their personal beliefs, or may have their likeness used to create false statements or confessions to acts that they may not have done. In addition, &#39;resurrecting&#39; deceased actors with generative AI will cause competition between the nostalgia-driven generative systems and human actors, making it that much harder for new actors entering the industry. Strict measures need to be put in place now, to provide precedent and enforcement before generative AI performances reach such a point.
