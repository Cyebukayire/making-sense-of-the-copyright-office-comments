As an artist I believe that AI image creators and corporations that use AI images should not be aloud to copyright any work as they are not the creators of the work. No human interaction or action is used to manipulate the image other than prompts into an image creator and all artist should be compensated fairly, even if it is to the detriment of the company, from any AI image creator that used or &#39;scrapped&#39; artist work to train the AI program. AI images are not art that is created by humans and should not be aloud the same protections as human artists. Allowing AI art to continue can lead to deep fakes and images that can be harmful to national security and elections or to the harm of individuals and/or their reputations or person until proper regulations and laws are in place to limit the use of AI and images created form it we should do all we can to limit its use and end monetization of AI images with harsh punishments to deter theft of art and personal gain as well as the potential harm AI can have on us as a nation.
