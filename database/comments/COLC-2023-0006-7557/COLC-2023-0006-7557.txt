So called &quot;AI&quot; not only implies an unkept promise, but it is also dangerous and created through illegally sourced inputs.<br/>The facade of intelligence that Venture Capitalists have used to overlay a basic probability calculator produces no real intelligence. In fact, such self-referenced intellectual &#39;navel-gazing&#39; reduces our ability to adapt to new information, novel concepts, our capacity to process the unknown, and also to develop creativity.<br/>Additionally, these programs were &#39;populated&#39; by illegal intellectual property theft on a massive scale. For that reason alone this process of AI creation must be countered, not by &#39;cost of business&#39; scale penalties, but rather by &#39;too costly to attempt&#39; consequences.<br/>Proper legislation will be a vital cornerstone now, and in the future, as we develop scalable protections not only from hyped-up VC promises, but also in protecting the processes and products of machine-guided intellectual advancements.<br/>LIMIT the inputs and REGULATE the products!<br/>Thank You,<br/>Lou Berkley<br/>San Francisco
