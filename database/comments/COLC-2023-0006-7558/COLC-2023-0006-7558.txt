In disclosure, I work as a copywriter and technical writer. Predictive algorithms (AI in this sense) are already in some use for fulfilling the roles I often fill, albeit in a limited fashion and very poorly. At the same time, my role has slowly been replaced by others as a cost-saving measurement, and the results of that (poor documentation, lack of transparency, bad user manuals and help guides) are fairly obvious to most consumers.<br/><br/>I submit this comment as an individual. I do not believe AI-generative works should be copyrightable and that attempting to provide legal protections for the output works (not the code itself) would simply cause damage to consumers at large.<br/><br/>Likewise, allowing AI-training datasets to continue working without transparency on their training information data sets or without record keeping of works and licenses would be an abuse. The difficulty of record keeping and licensing in this regard is not a valid excuse for this abuse.  Responses to questions posed are numbered below.<br/><br/>2.I work as a copy and technical writer. Use of an AI tool as a substitute for &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; as opposed to hiring quality work is liable to ignore emergent issues during the construction of user documentation leading to inaccurate and often dangerous documentation.<br/>4. Consistency across borders is relevant in that the more consistent the rules are, the more easily they can be adhered to. Online and global organizations are likely to follow some of the more restrictive rules at their base (the CAN-SPAM rules, for example).<br/>9. Copyright owners should have to opt-in, and any electronic forms should not be allowed to mark the opt-in box by default.<br/>9.1. All uses should require consent of the copyright owner to avoid abuses of distance. Use of material already requires a license for use, even if a separate license was purchase, this should apply so that usage rights are not simply waved if a copyright was allowed for research.<br/>9.2. Opt-Out models are easily abused and should not be used in this case. <br/>9.5. Use as training material should be treated as a separate copyright and should not be permitted as a forced part of a contract.<br/>15. Records of both the works submitted and the licensing of said works should be required for any AI training data sets. Creators of training datasets should also keep records of the licenses and stipulations for the data they use on their training sets. <br/>15.1. Nature of license, usage permitted by license (type of training dataset), date and duration of license use, name of copyright and which work or works are covered by the licensing of the work as well as transferability of said work.<br/>15.3. The same obligations held for ensuring licenses from stock photo, video, music, and text licensing sites are valid.<br/>15.4. If the purpose of copyright is to protect the work of those who created it, and the cost of operating an AI training dataset or AI generator is only viable at the expense of those rights, then AI is not viable at this time.<br/>18. It is not. Choosing the materials, setting, or phrases for a commissioned work does not make me the &lsquo;artist&rsquo; of a work only the purchaser.<br/>19. Are any revisions to the Copyright Act necessary to clarify the human authorship requirement or to provide additional standards to determine when content including AI-generated material is subject to copyright protection?<br/>20. Legal protection for AI-generated material is not desirable. In my opinion as a copywriter and technical writer, legal protection for the output of a tool is not the same as protection of a tool. Protecting the output of an AI generative tool will not encourage development in any further capacity, it will only encourage replacement of labor. Development of these tools will continue regardless, if it is protected solely as a tool (and the output is not copyrightable) then it will become solely an assist instead of a replacement.<br/>28. If a work is AI generated it should be labeled as such. From my own work in technical documentation, I would like to know how trustworthy a document is. Was it assembled by an AI, was it fact-checked by an AI, was there human sign-off and approval of a document?<br/>28.1. The publisher of a work should be responsible for identifying the work. Allowance should be made for if the producer of an AI work failed to notify the publisher that the work would be AI generated.<br/>30. No legal rights should apply to AI-generated material features a likeness of a particular person except non-duplication. The non-duplication exception would be to help prevent distribution. The exception to this would be if a person willingly and without coercion (in the form of &lsquo;this is required for employment either new or continued&rsquo;) licensed their likeness for use. <br/>
