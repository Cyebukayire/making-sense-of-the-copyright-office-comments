Thank you for inviting comment. As a writer, I find it crucial to protect creators as we advance technology.<br/><br/>In response to your questions:<br/>1. We are already seeing a deleterious effect in my industry. Every author I know has discovered recently, from reporting in the Atlantic ( https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/books3-database-generative-ai-training-copyright-infringement/675363/ ), that their work was used without their consent and without compensation to train generative AI. Kameron Hurley&#39;s experience&mdash;having to work two jobs to pay her medical bills while tech companies profit from her work and she sees none of that profit ( https://bsky.app/profile/kameronhurley.bsky.social/post/3kaapwamddv2b )&mdash;is common.<br/><br/>3. I urge you to consider the following letter from the media organization Luddite: https://luddite.pro/public-submission-for-usco-generative-ai-call-for-comment/ They argue wisely that copyright law does not need to change that much, but enforcement of it does need to improve, and it needs to protect even those who have not yet had a chance to register with the Copyright Office. Both art and technology move too fast in the present day for our older processes.<br/><br/>Thank you again for your consideration.
