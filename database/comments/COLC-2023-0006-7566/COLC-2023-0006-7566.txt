0) For the sake of not being a pain in the ass I will use &quot;a.i.&quot; when referring to &quot;machine learning&quot; outside of this point.  Nothing regulation is being considered for is actually able to think for itself. <br/><br/>1) the a.i. that we have is not capable of creating anything new.  It can only copy what is put into it, mash that together, and spit out something that might look new if you don&#39;t know the source material, but isn&#39;t actually new.  For this reason the data fed into these a.i. programs needs full transparency.  The public needs to be able to go through every a.i.&#39;s complete learning because<br/><br/>2) anything put into a.i. under copyright needs to pay royalties.  I&#39;ll put it in a way that I think Disney will agree with: Disney won&#39;t want some random person to just put all of the Mickey Mouse cartoons into an a.i. and just generate new Mickey Mouse cartoons and put them up on the internet for all to see.  At that point it will be just as easy to create new fake Mickey Mouse cartoons as it will be to take them down if not easier.  (I&#39;m ignoring that Mickey Mouse has no business still being under copyright after a hundred years.)<br/><br/>3) A.i. should at most be allowed to assist with making things, i.e. touching up an animation to make it cleaner.  Another example would be auto correct.  Auto correct isn&#39;t writing anything of value, it is just helping.  Anything more than that should mostly be deemed uncopyrightable.  What gives something value is the time and effort a person puts into making said thing.  With a.i. a person merely types in a prompt and the program spits out what was requested.  Now it might take some messing around with the prompt to get what the person wants generated, but the amount of time and effort is minuscule compared to what it would take a person with the knowhow to create the same thing, this also ignores the time it takes to learn i.e. how to draw.  Now I said &quot;mostly&quot; because there will be exceptions i.e. a paraplegic using a.i. to draw comics.  Cases such as that will need to be dealt with on a case to case basis.  You are going to want the regulation to allow for this while also preventing large corporations from i.e. hiring a bunch of people who meet the exception merely to have them read or write someone else&#39;s query into an a.i. to generate say a 20min cartoon show to get around the no copyright. <br/><br/>Sorry for the wall of text.  Hope it wasn&#39;t too rambly. <br/><br/>from,<br/>David
