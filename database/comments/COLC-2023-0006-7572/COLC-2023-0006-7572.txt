Yes, works that were used to train AI should be compensated. Any work(s) used by AI presently or in the future are breaking copyright law, liable to plagiarism, and the AI programmer and entity using AI to create work(s) should know they could be liable to a lawsuit if they use stolen work(s), whether known or unknown. It is the responsibility of the AI creator to reference where sources are being pulled from, just as an academic or student must reference where they source material in a work or else be liable for plagiarism. And the entity using AI to create work(s) should note where the sources are being pulled and compensate accordingly if copyrighted material or ideas are used in their work(s). <br/><br/>As a writer and creator, I do not want AI to source my work and give to an entity that will use my work and pass it off as their original work(s). AI will never be able to understand the human condition, but they will be able to steal it. And we must prevent AI from having access to copyrighted material or force the AI programmer to reference sources in its software.
