Hi, I am an artist struggling to make ends meet while working multiple jobs and trying to break into my industry of choice. I have done nothing but work hard at my craft and try to make a name for myself ever since passing all of my college courses with flying colors and being constantly told I had what it takes to make a name for myself as an artist. <br/><br/>However, my industry of choice refuses to hire new employees and AI art is a huge part of that. Not only does AI art steal artists works and rebrand them as their own, but because companies using said art think they can pass by their cheap imitations as real ones, we are only allowing for further exploitation of workers.<br/><br/>If AI art is allowed to shamelessly steal the hard-work of my fellow artists, and if companies are willing to fund these machines instead of hiring hard working people willing to do the job, not only will the years of hundreds of thousands of artists be lost for perfecting our skills, but we will create a dystopia in which no meaningful art can be created and celebrated. These corporations and companies are willing to sacrifice what it means to live in a world of art for a quick buck. They are not interested in the livelihoods they destroy, nor the boring, artless world that will emerge from this. And it wont stop with art. Every hard working American will lose their jobs if we allow this threat to continue, leaving us with only a broken, unhappy, angry, and further impoverished society.
