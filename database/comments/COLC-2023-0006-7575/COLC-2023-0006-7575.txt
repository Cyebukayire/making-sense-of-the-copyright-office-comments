Dear reader,<br/><br/>I&#39;m an artist who has posted extensively online since 2005 or so, much of my art being on Deviantart, Tumblr, Twitter, etc. As you know these sites have been scraped for the LAION B dataset. I&#39;ve run into situations online where AI users are essentially taking art an artist has posted online to make a digital copy of the artist, to directly compete against the original creator. Whether it&#39;s a corporation or malicious individual, I think using an artist&#39;s work in this fashion is reprehensible and disgusting. I would never allow anyone to do such a thing if it were within my control. I would love to see artists copyrights over their images protected so that using their work to &quot;outcompete&quot; them in this fashion would not be possible anymore. Right now my work is getting pilfered online and fed into machines that copy me, without my consent. I think this should be against the law.<br/><br/>That being said, I do not support the proposed solution to &quot;copyright style&quot;, as big corporations like Disney would use this opportunity to monopolize all art styles and effectively destroy the ability to legally make art in this country. I think that would be the death of art, and is not a sufficient solution to the issue. In fact I think this would be worse than the current AI situation.<br/><br/>I would love to instead see that using an artist&#39;s paintings to train AI without their consent be made illegal. I would love to be given better protections and legal control over our bodies of work. Criminalize people using our paintings to make generative AI art without a creator&#39;s explicit consent would be an ideal solution.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading, and your time.<br/>-A starving artist
