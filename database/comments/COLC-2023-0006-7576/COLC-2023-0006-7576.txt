In response to the general questions raised. I am approaching this as someone with a computer science and physics bachelors who has experience created neural networks and machine learning for multiple projects.<br/><br/>1. While it is true that if a human generated material that would be copyrightable. It is untrue or not proven that any AI created is generating an output that is wholly original. What it is doing is calculating some average or other statistic across all its inputs and providing an output. In the same way I am not able to write a paper without citing my sources, cannot purposely copy audio, modify it slightly and sell as my own without proper licensing and permission any company should not be able to effectively steal works and sell it as their own.<br/><br/>2. The main issue that that already arise is that the data companies are taking and feeding into their AI systems is not transparent. We do not know what data they are getting, how much of it are they getting, and what calculations they are using to get the AI to make a decision. Most if not all AI use some kind of statistics and probability to make decisions which a company should not own that process since probability and statistics are fundamental to nature.<br/><br/>5. I would separate AI use into some categories:<br/><br/>Using AI to create any audio/video or any kind of art: If the art is public domain or old enough where the original author is deceased, then an AI can be trained on it.<br/><br/>Using AI for research purposes: In science we use AI to make calculations on experimental or simulated data and use regression line fitting to come up with an equation that fits the data. Since most of the data collected is public knowledge and not taking anything from individuals then AI can and should be used as a tool to help researchers get results quicker.<br/><br/>Using AI to monitor systems: Companies should be using AI to measure how well their finances are doing. How their websites and servers are performing. and use customer surveys and reviews to measure their satisfaction.<br/><br/>In general any individuals or companies should not be using AI to steal other peoples work and present it as their own without both getting permission from the author and compensating them for their work.<br/><br/>6.1 anyone can download images from any web browser and search engine. For researches, it is collected through experimental or simulated data. Usually in the form of quantities. For example, measuring the speed of a car at a given point in time. The main issue is when private companies are taking art and trying to replicate it as their own.<br/><br/>6.3 If companies are taking copyrighted materials as training then it only makes sense that public domain works are also used as training. Its free data. It is conceivable that training material can be created. However, an audio file is about 1 MegaByte / minute of audio and most images are less than 1MB.<br/>To make an AI somewhat useful you would have to create hundreds if not thousands of images to get an AI to be accurate. That would take an unfathomable amount of work dedicated to making training material which would also take away time from developing the AI. It is much easier to search images and just grab everything. Also, most developers are not full fledged artists and musicians so that is an extra barrier to record audio and create graphics<br/><br/>6.4. In the computer science world, training is never &quot;complete&quot;. Like science, it is an always improving process. AI is not about how old the data is but rather the volume.<br/><br/>7.1 To put it briefly, the Nature of AI is probability and statistics. The AI can take in copyrighted works and reproduce an average of those works. Art is not about averages but thinking outside of the box.<br/><br/>7.2 The AI model &quot;infers&quot; or makes a decision based on the likelyhood that it made the correct decision in training. Those parameters can be adjusted to make the AI infer one way over another.<br/><br/>7.3 In short yes. You can run the training section again without the copyrighted data in the training pool. If these companies built the AI correctly, It should be as easy as re-running a section of code. Re-training could be the only way to unlearn the AI correctly other than re-creating it from scratch but that could take a long time to create<br/><br/>7.4 It is possible that every so often the AI may mess up and produce an output that is too heavily weighed on a specific data set. However, on average it is probably very improbable to detect. You can detect if the piece is AI generated but nothing specific. As an analogy think about trying to pick a specific unique marble out of a bag that contains hundreds or thousands of them without looking in the bag.<br/>9. It should be the responsibility of the company to ask for explicit permission for using the copyright owners work. Copyright owners have to affirmatively consent.
