Generative AI technologies are inherently hurtful to all copyright owners, these technologies were created with no problems to solve, while itself became a problem for everyone to deal with.<br/><br/>More than 5 billion pictures and artworks were scrapped off the internet against their creators&#39; consent and/or knowledge to be used for a technology they had no part in. Which after it was done, the same Generative AI technology, that requires those same works to function, and functions in a way that infringes the authors&#39; rights, is used against those same creators in order to exploit and replace them. Not only that, the companies behind these technologies are making billions of dollars in return for this clear and obvious exploitation, and it must be stopped as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Demands:<br/><br/>- Have companies acquire proper licenses from the copyright owners of the material needed.<br/>- Properly compensate the copyright owners for each and every single generation their work is used in.<br/>- Credit and publicly show all the works used in every single generation.<br/><br/>These machines are not human, they are not creative, they are solely a machine that uses other works and merges them together, created to replace a whole sleuth of jobs, while continuously exploiting the authors and workers it so desperately needs to function.<br/><br/>The creative class must be protected from these unethical practices, and the companies behind these technologies must pay for the ludicrous amounts of damage it has caused, and continues to cause, to everyone it has affected. <br/><br/>Creatives must be protected, as they are people who have worked their entire lives on their craft, found a way to make a living from it and support their families, and continue to innovate, inspire, and help humanity thrive and forge ahead.<br/><br/>AI should not ever get legal protection, stand with humans.<br/><br/>The file attached includes answers for the questions asked by the Federal Register.
