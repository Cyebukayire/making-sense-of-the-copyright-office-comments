34. Please identify any issues not mentioned above that the Copyright Office should consider in conducting this study.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m a self employed artist, and the recently released generative AI art programs such as midjourney and dall-e violate my copyrights, threaten future creative endeavors with &ldquo;copyright trolling&rdquo;, and prevent me from freely marketing my work. <br/><br/>Specifically, I&#39;m a professional medical illustrator. After earning a master&#39;s degree in medical illustration and working at the National Institutes of Health for 3 years, I launched my own company and became a small business owner in 2017.  Like thousands of other independent creatives, my livelihood and that of my family depends on the art that I create, as well as my ability to control and license that work under US copyright law. Unregulated AI art generation programs such as mid journey transgress my copyrights and threaten that livelihood. <br/><br/>My work, to which I own copyright, has been scraped up into AI training data sets and used without permission, along with that of thousands of other artists. Companies who develop these tools are infringing on creator copyright at an unforeseen and unprecedented scale. This is not fair use - it&rsquo;s exploitation. Companies cannot be allowed to simply beg forgiveness while profiting off these tools that supplant the artists that they flagrantly stole from. <br/><br/>As a result of AI scraping, I can no longer freely market my own work. If I put an example of my work on my website or a social media platform, now I have to expect that it will be scraped up by AI programs. If I market my portfolio to gain more work short term, it may cost me work long term as AI developers seek to replace me. This is completely unfair - I should be able to display my work online without the fear of it being stolen. <br/><br/>I am also concerned about the possibility of AI art being copyrighted and being used for &ldquo;copyright trolling&rdquo;. My foremost concern is that bad actors will use AI to cheaply generate millions of permutations of an illustration or script, register for copyright, and then have grounds to sue anyone who happens to create something similar. This would be a new variation on patent trolling. <br/><br/>I am writing most of this in the middle of the night. I&rsquo;m on maternity leave, holding my two week old son and finding it disturbingly easy to stay awake as I wonder what future awaits him. Will unregulated AI art become just another instance of corporate greed going unchecked over the coming decades, slowly stripping rights and opportunities away from individuals in favor of big business behemoths? What opportunities will my son never have because these huge companies have been given free rein to profiteer off every aspect of our lives?<br/><br/>Independent artists and creative small businesses need their copyrights to be meaningful and enforceable in order to survive. It is the duty of the US Copyright office to ensure that we have access to these rights. Please don&rsquo;t sell us out to big business interests. <br/>
