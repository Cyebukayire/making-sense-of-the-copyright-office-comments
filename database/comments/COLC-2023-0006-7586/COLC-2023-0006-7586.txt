Generative AI or machine learning, as it currently stands, is the inexcusable theft of artists works to generate results that are not only trained off of those stolen works, but then are used to compete with the original artists in their same market. Content generated in this way, seeing that it relies entirely on stolen works, must not be allowed copyright, since by its very nature it cannot produce anything without those stolen works. Creatives deserve to be given the option to consent to this training, receive credit and monetary compensation for works used, and control over how their works are used.
