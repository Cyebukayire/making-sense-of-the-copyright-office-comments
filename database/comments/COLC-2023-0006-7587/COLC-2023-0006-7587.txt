AI generated systems have advanced faster than our copyright laws. We need to properly protect human artists and their livelihoods. There is a possibility of a coexistence here, but only if we address that there is a problem with lagging regulations. If we lose that protection, we will surely lose the humanity that comes from art&rsquo;s core, which is derived from human beings. Please act fast because AI systems are clearly not slowing down.
