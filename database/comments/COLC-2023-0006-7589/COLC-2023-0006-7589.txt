I am fine with allowing any AI Model to be used under the following circumstances:<br/>- It is trained on images that it can legally use without copyright infringement.<br/>- It does not mimic, or trace, the art style of a living artist for monetary gains. Any commercial uses of AI Images must have its own distinct style.<br/>- It is not used for defamatory or slanderous purposes.
