A.I art steals art from actual artists. They use an artwork from an artist and post it into their A.I program before creating a prompt. The prompt then goes on to generate what the person using A.I wants, however. It uses the style of the artist.<br/>Artist&#39;s don&#39;t own styles. However, the person who inserted the image rarely asks the artist for permission to use the artwork.<br/>The artwork would have been made, taking actual hours from the artist.<br/>The A.I art would take only a few seconds or minutes.<br/><br/>Stealing is stealing. Taking someones art is morally wrong and plus using it to make art similar and claim it as your own is especially wrong. This shows no respect to the original artist as they would never have been credited or be asked for their art to be used for such purposes.<br/>This is very similar to claiming someone elses art is yours because it in fact technically this is the same thing as A.I art. A.I art takes artists drawings to make something eerily similar, without crediting the original artwork and flat out stealing art is the same, just without the A.I part.<br/><br/>This must be stopped as artists are now feeling it is pointless to create and share art with eachother. <br/><br/>A.I art would not even exist had art never been a thing. <br/>So taking away the art and replacing it with A.I will make many things artificial, make true art rare and eventually the prompts will run dry and create the same stuff as there will be no new true artworks to serve as a sacrifice for the A.I to use and create new &#39;artworks&#39;.<br/>Eventually, real artists would not even bother.<br/><br/>Getting a following as an artist is hard enough. Especially with insta as smaller artists can no longer reach many people. The recent posts on instagram have been removed from hashtags, this makes it so smaller artists can not can a following and bigger artists will get bigger.<br/>Top recent posts are not the same as recent posts.<br/>A.I will only make this worse.
