Dear reader,<br/><br/>I&#39;m an artist/designer and writer, and while my full-time job means that I don&#39;t often post online, I - and other creators I know - have run into situations online where AI users are essentially taking multiple pieces of art or writing that has been posted online to generate work that looks as if it was made by those artists or writers, and using that to directly compete against the original creators. Whether it&#39;s a corporation or malicious individual, I think using a person&#39;s work in this fashion is reprehensible and disgusting; not only stealing that person&#39;s work, but making it so that they are almost replaced by a cheap copy - which can often affect their livelihoods. I would never allow anyone to do such a thing if it were within my control. I would love to see creator&#39;s copyrights over their work protected so that using their work to &quot;outcompete&quot; them in this fashion would not be possible anymore. Right now, if I were to post my work online, my work would likely get pilfered and fed into machines that copy me without my consent. I think this should be against the law.<br/><br/>That being said, I do not support the proposed solution to &quot;copyright style&quot;, as big corporations like Disney, for example, would use this opportunity to monopolize all art styles similar to theirs, and effectively destroy the ability of everyone else to legally make art in this country. I think that would be the death of art, and would even be worse than the current AI situation.<br/><br/>I would love to instead see that using an artist&#39;s or writer&#39;s work to train AI without the creator&#39;s consent be made illegal. I would love to be given better protections and legal control over our bodies of work. Seeing AI users criminalized for using our work to make generative AI art without a creator&#39;s explicit consent would be an ideal solution.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading, and your time.<br/>-A working artist
