Artists and content creators need to be compensated for their work being used in Artificial Intelligence training data sets. AI developers should also be required to obtain permission from creator of original works before it can be used to train AI models<br/><br/>Artist&#39;s and creator&#39;s work is often used to train generative AI models which then emulate the original work of the said artists or creators without any credit or compensation. This would be inappropriate in all other contexts. Artificial Intelligence developers also scrape the internet for their training data sets and do not notify or gain permission from artists and content creators before using their work and subsequently emulating their work. This voids the content originator&#39;s ability to control how their work is consumed and used as they would normally be entitled to.
