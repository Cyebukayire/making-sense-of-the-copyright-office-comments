So here is what I gathered and what my thoughts are<br/><br/>Issues at stake include:<br/>1) Should artists be compensated for being used in AI models.<br/>-Yes<br/>2) Whether material produced by AI generation should be allowed to hold copyright, and if so, how much input is required to receive protection.<br/>-No<br/>3) Who is liable for infringing works. Should the algorithm creators be able to wash their hands of any infringement created and leave it all on the user<br/>-Yes<br/>4) How should AI outputs that identify the style or identity of human artists be handled, eg) AI actors using dead actors and voices and stuff.<br/>-A little mixed here. I&rsquo;d say if something were to happen to an actor when they were recording something, they&rsquo;ll need permission to use their voice for the AI to replicate
