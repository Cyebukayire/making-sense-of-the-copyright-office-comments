<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I believe the original artists should be compensated for their work if used by AI. Lately many artists I know of are having a hard time competing against AI art, which draws significantly faster than regular artists. They take information and data from already existing art and do not compensate them which is like stealing an idea. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI generations itself shouldn&#39;t be able to be copyrighted, as AI art doesn&#39;t really use human input to create it. From trade secrets, to entertainment IPs, and even patents for inventions; all of these need human ingenuity to create them. As which, those can be protected. A machine doesn&#39;t create, and lacks the same protections that humans do. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Although, if the AI generation is then recreated from scratch by human hand, based on the image generated, there is some exception. For it to be considered viable for protection, it needs to be remade and drawn entirely by human input via an artist. The property in question must also be regularly used and created for different purposes like showcasing art, used in shows, utilized for educational purposes, or act as a sort of advertisement. It must be used on a regular basis as so one can&#39;t simply make an AI generated object and have it sit unsued inside a digital warehouse. To prevent potential intellectual hoarding. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Companies who use AI to get around laborers (like artists and voice actors), and those who use existing artist content without compensation and permission should be liable. Algorithm creators need to share some responsibility when creating AI. Lately, companies like Disney and Hollywood have been trying to replace actors with AI. If they are to develop such technology, they must share some responsibility in it as well. <br/><br/>    I do believe in the idea that an idea or style isn&#39;t protected by copyright. As parodies, recreations, and inspired artists rightfully take such directions while remaining unique, and transformative. Though, using AI of dead actors and such is a complicated subject. Personally, I believe that commercial companies shouldn&#39;t be able to use such, unless given explicit permission within their will or via the corresponding party. Similarly can be said when using dead individuals inappropriately for corporate and political gain when not specified beforehand by the deceased. <br/>Actors should be compensated if companies are to create AI in their likeness for movies and such.
