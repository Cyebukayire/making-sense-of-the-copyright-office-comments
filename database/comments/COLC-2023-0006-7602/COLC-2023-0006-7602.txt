Hi.  Not claiming any expertise, just someone who&#39;s been trying to follow the various stories.  Quick version is I&#39;m against what we are calling AI.  It is not intelligence of any sort;  seems to be mostly pattern prediction,  often stealing from trademarked works.  I cannot support such lies and thievery.    <br/><br/>Thank you and good night, Jonathan Blume
