AI &quot;art&quot; is literally stealing other people&#39;s hard work and creativity. There is nothing &quot;intelligent&quot; about it. Companies big or small should be ashamed for having this just so they don&#39;t hire artists. This will ruin and destroy the art industry with millions of people out of jobs. If companies want to use AI, then there should be an AI watermark all over so they can&#39;t use it for profit.
