While there is no escape from AI, the ethics of stealing work from artists of all kinds, is morally wrong. Artists are being thrown under the bus in favor of a product made fast. While there may be pros to AI, and there are, we must remember that it currently comes from the expense of artists that have had their work stolen. Often with no say in the matter. I de believe that allowing AI to not be copyrighted not only can help prevent work from being stolen, but jobs as well. There is value in the creative field, even though it currently doesn&#39;t seem like it. Allowing AI to take the place of art and  creatively, by allowing AI to be copyright, would be a big blow for everyone. It would destroy the foundation in which art (of any kind) is created.
