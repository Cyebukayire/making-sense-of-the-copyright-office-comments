Human creators must be compensated for their work that is used to train AI, or otherwise used to produce AI content. This should apply to visual artists, writers, singers and musicians, dancers and actors, etc. There is no AI generated content without human creation first, and it cannot supplant human copyright or fair compensation. Get the reins on AI now before it destroys industries so many enjoy and aspire to.
