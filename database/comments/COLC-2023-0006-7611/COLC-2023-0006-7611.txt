AI-generated images/artwork should be under dramatically stricter regulations, if not outright removed from the general public&#39;s reach.  There are thousands upon thousands of people around the world who make their living by drawing artwork for other people.  AI images significantly jeopardize the livelihoods of all of those people, as far too many people are convinced they can/should just &quot;create&quot; the artwork they want for free by typing in a few words into a generator.<br/><br/>On top of that, AI images (as they are now) absolute violate all sorts of copyrights and agreements and whatnot.  These AI systems are training themselves off of the artwork of existing, real, actual artists, with very few of those artists agreeing to such.  They&#39;re almost certainly learning and generating images based off of *actual* copyrighted/protected works as well.  In effect, AI art is nothing short of theft, ripping off and plagiarizing the hard, honest work of legitimate artists everywhere.<br/><br/>PLEASE strongly consider bringing down the hammer on AI image/art generators, for the benefit of artists and people across the country, and across the globe.  Thank you.
