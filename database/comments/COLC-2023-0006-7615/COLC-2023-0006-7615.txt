AI should be used to help an artist, not replace them. AI generated art can be great reference material, and should be nothing more than that. <br/><br/>AI art, as of right now, is harmful.<br/><br/>I have many artist friends (including myself but I am more of a hobbyist), and I can say with confidence that AI &quot;art&quot; is harmful and unwanted in the art community with the way it is currently being handled. This being because none of us want to see works we have poured effort in to, to be misused in ways we do not want.<br/><br/>AI &quot;art&quot; as of now is ingenuine and steals from artists who have dedicated years to drawing by taking their art and combining it with other works. AI in is current form is imperfect as they can just focus on copying one artist&#39;s art style; and the artist may not even know about it.<br/><br/>Many businesses/social media websites try to, or even succeed sneaking in AI products onto their websites to work off of artists&#39; works- usually by having the option to opt out, but having said option enabled automatically whenever the AI update rolls in so those who are uninformed will begin to have their art being taken for AI purposes without them knowing.<br/><br/>Artists should not only be made aware and able to clearly opt in/out of their art being used for AI, but also to be compensated by those who want to use their art in AI models.<br/><br/>AI generated art should not be allowed to hold copyright, as it takes from other art pieces usually made by other people.<br/><br/>Algorithm creators should be able to get away with any infringement created.<br/><br/>The deceased and their voices don&#39;t belong in AI (unless they willingly opted for it?) and the same goes for those who are alive.
