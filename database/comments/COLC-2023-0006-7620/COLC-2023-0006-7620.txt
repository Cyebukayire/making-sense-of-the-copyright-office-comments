AI is at a moment of impasse that will decide it&#39;s purpose: to help people or to remove them from the equation. AI generated materials should not be granted copyright licenses unless the output is substantially altered by a human author for many reasons. These models are trained on mass amounts of data, most of which are copyrighted themselves. The work that AI creates can&#39;t be used to further train itself, proving that the models aren&#39;t creating anything new- only stripping away from other sources. Without human authorship, nothing new is being created. At this moment, AI poses a great threat to the livelihoods of millions of Americans and would only benefit the companies that get to devalue and fire them.
