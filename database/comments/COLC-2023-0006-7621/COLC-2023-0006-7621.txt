As a creative, AI art and AI writing damages hard working creators such as myself. This is in spite of AI art appearing soulless, error-prone, and often low quality compared to their human-crafted counterparts. While the fun of AI generation comes from creation of internet memes, it has thus far been used by not only scammers, but major entertainment industries, thus leaving already struggling creators out of a job, as we&rsquo;ve seen in the latest Writer&rsquo;s strike.<br/><br/>AI art also draws off works to create imagery in the first place which also compounds things. It could rapidly devolve into a nightmare situation where AI and man-made works are indistinguishable. For someone laboring weeks, even months at a project for some guy at home to write an epic in 10 seconds is a slap in the face to artists who not only enjoy the craft, but survive on it.<br/><br/>As a result, I have a few concerns I believe have to be addressed<br/><br/>1) AI creations must never be used for profit.<br/><br/>2) AI creation tools (Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, etc.) must have some kind of watermark showing that the art is AI generated and in such a way to make editing this watermark out difficult.<br/><br/>3) AI creation tools must state, up front, how their service should and shouldn&rsquo;t be used and repercussions for breaking these agreements.<br/><br/>4) Consumer right to opt out of all AI and machine learning tools and have users be opted out BY DEFAULT. This is not exclusive to art creation, but with personal and general data as well.<br/><br/>We, as creatives, are tired of the concerns that AI will replace us, as seen with Netflix and Disney aggressively using AI in their works, even hiring AI artists to work at absurd salaries. For the sake of creatives everywhere, AI creations must be heavily regulated.
