I may be disabled, but I&#39;ve seen too many artists, too many voice actors, too many hardworking people, not just in the US but across the globe, for it to be ignored with how harmful AI has been. and I&#39;d even say AI has the potential to harm businesses by allowing blatant theft from them.<br/><br/>don&#39;t give AI an inch. they will stretch it to the miles and beyond and everyone will be harmed.<br/><br/>don&#39;t let them copyright. fine the SHIT out of the blatant plagiarism.
