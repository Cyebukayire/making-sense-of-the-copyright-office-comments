Artists whose work is used to inform AI need to be compensated, AI-produced material should not receive copyright protection, and it should be stated up-front if an AI material is referencing a specific person or style, particularly if that person or creator of that style is deceased. <br/><br/>Vis-&agrave;-vis responsibility for taking references, I cannot say if that is entirely on the AI user or the AI itself- that would likely come down to a case-by-case basis. If the artist gives the AI specific works to recreate, then the artist is responsible. If the AI is given a one-word prompt and then researches its own works to imitate, then the AI itself is responsible.<br/><br/>It was the threat of using AI writers that contributed to the recent writers&rsquo; strike in Hollywood, and I echo their sentiments. As an author and creator, the carelessness of AI usage has been frustrating to say the least. I will not stand for my hard work and creativity being supplanted by computers. <br/><br/>The ramifications go beyond my own sentiments. AI generations that imitate dead people or their work are in extremely poor taste and offer no respect for the family and loved ones of the deceased. If such works are to be used, the families should give consent and receive compensation for having a deceased loved one&rsquo;s likeness being used. Zelda Williams, daughter of Robin Williams, has expressed concern over her father being imitated.<br/><br/>Moreover, unregulated AI poses a great security risk. There are incidents of AI voices used to extort money and support criminal activity by posing as the loved one, and in my own family, we have given thought to having a &ldquo;code word&rdquo; to identify who is who. <br/><br/>In summary, AI is unethical at best and dangerous at worst. It must be regulated in the public sphere.<br/>
