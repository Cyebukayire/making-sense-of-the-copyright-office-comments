This is a submission of opinion on the 4 issues identified in Section IV The Current Inquiry. They can be read as direct responses to the paragraph describing each of issue. I am answering in a personal and a professional capacity as both a working photographer and a hobbyist musician, illustrator, and designer. I have used several different AI models for both text and image generation and I have a general understanding of how they operate under the hood. I also have a longstanding interest in IP law and have read much about copyright law, in particular as it pertains to art and photography.<br/><br/>My Thesis: All AI generated outputs should be considered Derivative Works and should be immediately placed into the Public Domain. This enriches the free and open canon of human creativity while also mitigating the commercial harm to actual human creators by introducing brand risk and legal ambiguity to commercial entities seeking to use generative AI to replace human creators.<br/><br/>Issue 1:<br/>It is my view that the act of duplicating creative works, even just for the purpose of training an AI model is infringement. I would go so far as to say that due to the nature of the AI model, all subsequent AI generations are to some extent derivative works. I believe the instances of AI models generating images with phantom watermarks make it clear that all works generated by the model are inexorably effected by the underlying training data. In fact I think the only reason this is in question is the sheer scale of the data harvested to train these AI models covers up the contributions of each individual datum.<br/><br/>As for how to compensate the rights-holders, I fear there are no solid systems to regulate this industry.  The largest and most successful firms could be made to account for all their training data and pay into some fund, but smaller firms or more bespoke community models (like Stable Diffusion models) are going to be very difficult to police.  This would disproportionately disadvantage the firms that comply and advantage firms not complying or based in countries outside of US jurisdiction.  Ultimately I think that the use of my creative works in training data is unknowable to me.  I believe a truly radical overhaul of intellectual property would be required to actually compensate all the human authors.  Short of this I return to my core thesis:<br/>Placing all AI generated works into the Public Domain enriches the free and open creative canon of the world while also mitigating the commercial harm to actual human creators.<br/><br/>Issue 2:<br/>I believe that the human interation with generative AI models constitute Curation rather than Creation. Imagine a Photo Editor for a magazine. This human looks at all the images taken by a photographer and selects the one that they feel is best for the cover. Does this act constitute authorship? Is the Photo Editor now afforded the copyright for the image that they selected?  Is that intellectual property purloined from the Photographer? No, no, &amp; no.  Theirs is an act of Curation rather than Creation.<br/><br/>Similarly, interacting with AI art program is an exercise in curation. The human inputs a request and the AI returns an output. The human may then choose to clarify the output of the AI with new requests and revisions. But ultimately the AI is creating the output and the human selects what is published.<br/><br/>As another example of this creative relationship: When a Graphic Designer and their Client go through rounds of revision on a logo the Client&rsquo;s notes and input about those revisions do contribute to the final logo but do not constitute authorship as it is the Designer who creates the actual work.<br/><br/>I propose an &ldquo;imaginary human&rdquo; test for drawing the line between human creation and AI-generation.  In short, imagine the generative AI is a human worker; does the instructional relationship between the actual human and the imaginary human (generative AI) constitute authorship or is it simply curation?<br/><br/>Continued in subsequent comment<br/>
