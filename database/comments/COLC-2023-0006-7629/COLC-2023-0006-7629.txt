Continuation from previous comment<br/>This is a submission of opinion on the 4 issues identified in Section IV The Current Inquiry. They can be read as direct responses to the paragraph describing each of issue. I am answering in a personal and a professional capacity as both a working photographer and a hobbyist musician, illustrator, and designer. I have used several different AI models for both text and image generation and I have a general understanding of how they operate under the hood. I also have a longstanding interest in IP law and have done considerable research into copyright as it pertains to art and photography.<br/><br/>My Thesis: All AI generated outputs should be considered Derivative Works and should be immediately placed into the Public Domain. This enriches the free and open canon of human creativity while also mitigating the commercial harm to actual human creators by introducing brand risk and legal ambiguity to commercial entities seeking to use generative AI to replace human creators.<br/><br/>Issue 3:<br/>This ambiguous liability lies at the heart of generative AI systems. As I have stated above, it is my position that all generative AI outputs are derivative* works, even if they do not clearly resemble any single piece of their training data. There is potential for commercial harm in the event an AI generated output too closely resembles the work of a human author, but I believe that placing all AI generated outputs in the Public Domain significantly discourages large commercial entities from using generative AI to mimic a single artist. There are undoubtedly still gaps, especially for Statutory Damages, but for Actual Damages I think existing case law for profiting off of unauthorized derivative works could be applied.<br/><br/>Solving this and the previous issue of compensating original authors is a shortcoming of my proposed thesis, which aims to instigate as little disruption as possible to our broader copyright systems. If there is political will for more sweeping change I think Benn Jordan outlines a compelling alternative to our existing copyright systems in this video titled &ldquo;Ending Copyright Could Save Art &amp; Journalism&rdquo; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJSTFzhs1O4<br/><br/>* &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t all human works derivative? Artists are inspired by each other all the time!&rdquo; This is certainly true, but there is one core distinciton between humans and AI models. Humans do not engage with a curated dataset. Humans have a neural network (brain) that is fed by constant and unfiltered sensory data. Much of that sensory data is not human authored but may inspire creative works. The sensation of a breeze, the feeling of the sun on my skin, the tinnitus ringing in my ears, the hallucinatory effects of psychedelics&hellip;all of these things contribute to the dataset that a human mind can draw from. Generative AI is not complex enough to generate meaningful outputs from such broad unfiltered inputs, nor is it physically capable of experiencing stimuli.<br/>(And this says nothing of the human ability cross mediums. A painting inspired by the events of book, a song inspired by a painting, etc.)<br/><br/>Issue 4:<br/>I think there are two separate concerns here: 1) mimicking an artist&rsquo;s style and 2) impersonation/mimicking an individual&rsquo;s likeness.<br/><br/>1). An artist&rsquo;s &ldquo;style&rdquo; is not copyrightable. If I were to mimic the style of Picasso and sell drawings that remind people of his work, there is no infringement occurring. I am creating my own artistic works; style is just the idea of how an artist&rsquo;s works might look and that idea is not copyrightable. Mitigating commercial viability of AI generated outputs should sufficiently address concerns of commercial harm due to AI mimicry of their style.<br/><br/>2). Persons have rights to their likeness and can retaliate against genuine impersonation. They do not have means to prevent others from imitating them. In the music industry soundalikes exist and have been subject to litigation. Ultimately, if I as a human can do a perfect impression of Drake or Taylor Swift, they can&rsquo;t really stop me from making music with my voice. <br/>Purely through the lens of legal precedents this is a generally solved problem. But with the scale and ease of use offered by AI the proliferation of AI Deepfakes of prominent public figures poses a massive societal risk. If the US PTO is capable of making these illegal or imposing an absurdly punitive fine for creating them then it perhaps ought to. But purely from a copyright law perspective it think my existing thesis holds. Allow the issue of likeness to be litigated outside of copyright court.<br/>
