Personally I find AI to be fine in use for good fun, but I don&#39;t believe that the usage of AI for paid promotion or commercial use is ethical. Don&#39;t see any problem with making a funny picture of, I don&#39;t know, Mickey Mouse on a skateboard through AI, but I see a problem with generating logos, replacing workers, and using AI to create media meant for monetization. Considering most AI models are built off of &quot;learning&quot; from actual artists/photographers, it feels unethical to use anything produced by AI as a means of making money.<br/>I think this goes insofar as independent artists should not be selling AI artwork without marking it as such, nor should corporations use AI modeled off of other people&#39;s work to create things they&#39;re using as promotional material or actual product.<br/>Just my thoughts as a consumer.
