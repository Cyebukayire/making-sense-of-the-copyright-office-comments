AI has value as a tool for designers. It can save work and time. However, it is not a replacement for thoughtful design. AI can help create a second of animation, but a real person is always going to need to fix it. AI cannot and should not replace the jobs of designers. Rather, it works best as a tool to save time and effort so that they can apply their ideas more efficiently rather than doing tedious work.<br/><br/>Furthermore, AI should not be able to scrape for datasets without the consent of the original creator.
