I believe that content created by A.I. models should not be allowed to be copyrighted in any way, and copyrighted content should not be allowed to be used as source content for training A.I. models without express written consent of the creator of the copyrighted works. Allowing A.I. models and other &quot;neural nets&quot; to access, use, or rely on content that has not been appropriately released goes against U.S. copyright law, materially harms the creators of said copyrighted works, and should not be permitted in any context. Furthermore, the content created by these A.I. models requires so much input from other works, and so little direction or input from the &quot;creator&quot; of the work, that I do not believe those works should be eligible for any forms of copyright protection from the U.S. government. Most technological advancements aid or support human creativity and achievement--A.I. completely replaces it. It does not constitute actual human creation, and does not deserve any protection around its contents.
