As a professional artist AI and the art theft associated with it are deeply dangerous to my industry as well as my personal intellectual property. Copyright law needs to be updated to protect artist from having their art stolen by image generating ai and passed off as another&#39;s work. AI engines do not create new work they simply modify existing work and to allow an AI engine to use and edit the work of another with out their permission is theft plain and simple. Arts often function as small business and there for require legal protections in order to continue to sustain themselves.
