I believe that every person whose art, crafts, photography, writing, internet posts, or other content online that has been used to train any Artificial Intelligence product used to earn a profit, should be compensated for the use of their intellectual and copyrighted property. It is shameful that this was seen as a loophole to begin with, and the government needs to ensure that everyone whose material was used, either willingly or unwillingly, is fully compensated for that use.
