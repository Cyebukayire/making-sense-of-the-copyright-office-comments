(1) As an author of 23 published novels (all of which I have obtained copyright certificates for to ensure I can fight infringment to the maximum extent of the law), I take strong objection to the use of copyrighted works to train AI models. The copyright owners were not given the ability to opt-in to this type of training. This is a violation of the author/artists right to control their body of work and invites further infringement as people can then use AI to create works in a particular author&rsquo;s voice or in an artist&rsquo;s style.<br/><br/>(2) Material created by AI should not be copyrightable because the AI generators were created by using other people&rsquo;s work&mdash;for which the AI creators did not hold permission or copyright&mdash;to build the models. The output from these generators does not belong to the person who queried the chatbot. They had no role in the creativity involved. Story ideas are not the end product. The product is the execution. The writing, the drawing, painting, or animation. And for writing or a work of art to be copywritable, a human needs to be the source of the art.<br/><br/>(3) Authors and artists who have been stolen from need to be compensated. The AI datasets that involve stolen work need to be destroyed. Creators of new datasets need to show opt in data for every work used to train their AI.<br/><br/>(4) This is perhaps the most disturbing and exploitive use of AI - to actively infringe on an author or artists livelihood by creating (and potentially selling) works in their style. This is theft of existing copyright and has the potential to destroy authors and artists ability to earn an income from their own work. It can also be harmful to an author&rsquo;s reputation if inferior work is passed off as theirs. This is ripe for fraud and abuse, harming authors and consumers.
