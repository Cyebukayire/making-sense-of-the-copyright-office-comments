The use of human made art to &quot;train&quot; (re)-generative software in the creation of derivative works is a matter that must be confronted through legislation and regulation.<br/><br/>Individual creators do not have the ability to maintain control over all third party uses of the work they have created and own under copyright. Collectively, the courts also do not have the capacity to litigate every single instance of these massive businesses brazenly absorbing the immense private labor of thousands of artists. <br/><br/>These are the instances for which regulatory agencies were designed. <br/><br/>Please take action to restrict the unsanctioned use of human generated art in the training of Artificial Intelligence.
