I believe that artists should be compensated for the use of their work, including AI models. The novelty alone brings so much traffic to sites that can easily incorporate ads to profit off the use of their AI model, or use that AI for their own promotion, that they will most definitely be profiting off of the use of these artist&#39;s pieces in some way.<br/><br/> I believe that AI generated content should not be able to hold copyright. Copyright exists to protect people from theft. AI models have long existed by stealing thousands of images, text samples, etc from people who were wholly unaware their images would be used in this way. Even supposing that it can be copyrighted, the rights would undoubtedly be held by the content&#39;s creator, the ai itself. Not the company that made the AI, not the person plugging in prompts. The program that &quot;created&quot; the work. Seeing as this would be impossible to enforce on the program&#39;s behalf, bestowing any copyright to anyone would be undeserved at best.<br/><br/>The liability of copyright infringement, then, should be on whoever uses the ai-generated copyright infringing material to profit. An AI generated mickey mouse itself is harmless, assuming no copyright is granted for the image. If the company uses it to promote the model, as an example of what it&#39;s AI model can do, it will be liable. If a user puts the image on a t-shirt, they will be liable.<br/><br/>I wholly believe that the use of AI voice models of real actors (living or dead) is going to kill the entertainment industry from back to front. I think that with less human actors and writers, many projects are going to be less creative, less interesting, and more derivative. Over time you&#39;ll see more stale, samey content until the bubble bursts and people start turning to amateur filmmakers across the country for the stories they want to hear. From a purely accelerationist standpoint it seems pretty good, but its very obviously not a great thing to have happen
