The best and most expedient action for the US Office of Copyright at this moment in regards to new emerging technologies that incorporate generative artificial intelligence would be to expand the working definition of derivative works currently in use in its practices to incorporate such works that are derived from pre-existing copywritten materials. Expanding this definition should be fairly straightforward... simply put it to a vote (if needed) and incorporate the new language as an update. A new audit process will need to be established to ensure fairness and to preserve the intellectual property rights that each copyright owner expects to receive from the US Copyright Office and the Judicial Branch. Creating this audit process will be tricky though. Support from the Judicial Branch will be needed to hold accountable those parties currently publishing new works derived by using tools that exhibit generative artificial intelligence from old works and/or catalogs of copywritten materials and retroactively regard the use of these previously copywritten datasets/catalogs/works as copyright infringement. <br/>
