Printed Page 59946<br/>Question 1: As it stands currently, the benefits of these programs is their ability to aggregate and extrapolate data. Which can be, and has been, used to monitor animal populations, power grids. In this particular case, they extrapolate that pattern of human made pixels and words. The risks, already rearing their heads known, is massive increases of impersonation, misinformation, mass copyright violations and the destruction multiple creative industries resulting from said copyright violations. Which are detailed further in the response to Question 6.<br/><br/>Question 2: While not unique to my sector, the flood of algorithmically generated books has made attaining visibility as a human author much more difficult. In the same vein, magazines in which people submit stories have been flooded with what can best be described as spam. Clarkesworld magazine in particular was hit hard, going from about a hundred submissions per month to thousands, and was forced to close submissions for the first time in it&#39;s 17 year history to get a handle on the situation.<br/><br/>Question 3: AI Art and its Impact on Artists published by the Association for Computer Machinery<br/><br/>Question 5: Adding specific language regarding machine learning to already existing Copyright Laws would be sufficient as far as my understanding goes. Though such laws cannot be properly enforced unless the models that already exist are fully transparent in where they get their training data from. As it stands currently all the models are more or less black boxes.<br/><br/>Question 6: Books, images, videos, anything on the Internet is gathered with bots that automatically gather the works unless specifically blocked. Which is a somewhat technical process for an average person to undertake. Curation is mostly handled by workers overseas, such as Africa, who are paid substandard wages to curate the data collected by the bots.<br/><br/>6.1: Books3, colloquially called &quot;The Pile&quot; is a collection of pirated e-books that was used to train LLMs as confirmed in an article by Alex Reisner of the Atlantic in August 2023.<br/><br/>6.2: As far as I am aware, no works are licensed by the copyright holder. Though platforms that the copyright holders use to post their work, such as Artstation, have offered the works on those platforms as training data.<br/><br/>Printed Page 59947<br/><br/>Question 9: Copyright owners should opt-in for usage of their works as training data.<br/><br/>9.1: Opt-in should extend to all usage, not just commercial.<br/><br/>9.2: As mentioned in the response to question 6, it is possible to block web crawlers on your webpage but it requires more technical knowledge than the average person with a computer possesses. Not to mention that Alphabet Inc., otherwise known as Google, has stated that anyone that blocks their own crawler will not be indexed in web search. And as the purveyor of the most used web browser in the world, blocking theirs will kill one&#39;s reach.<br/><br/>9.4: Appropriate remedies already exist.<br/><br/>9.5: The creator, no matter who they are, should have the right to to object to their work being used for AI models.<br/><br/>Question 10: Direct voluntary licensing is the only ethical approach and the only approach that will ensure consent and compensation for  rightsholders.<br/><br/>Question 12: While it possible to identify some specific pieces that were used as &quot;reference&quot; for the generated output through the similarities, it would likely be unfeasible to determine due to the billions of works used to create the datasets and models.<br/><br/>Question 15: Creators of datasets and the models should keep publicly available records of every work used in both datasets and models.<br/><br/>15.1: Every work used should be annotated as to where it was acquired, who created it originally, and assuming the rightsholder isn&#39;t the same as the creator, the rightsholder of the work.<br/><br/>15.2: Disclosures should be made to rightsholders and creators of any given work.<br/><br/>Question 16: Developers and curators of any model or dataset should be fully obligated to notify copyright holders with penalties for failing to do so.<br/><br/>Printed Page 59948<br/><br/>Question 18: Under current law, a human could hold authorship of generated output if they are the rightsholder to every piece the model was trained on. No such model currently exists.<br/><br/>Question 19: Yes revisions are necessary to clarify human authorship is required for protection.<br/><br/>Question 20: It is neither desirable nor is it ethical given the vast amounts of data stolen to make such models function.<br/><br/>Question 21: The clause does not protect generated material and the technology does little to promote science and progress of useful arts.<br/><br/>Question 30: Generated voice, likeness, and name of a person would be impersonation along with false endorsement.<br/><br/>Question 31: Congress should not establish any rights for AI generated material.<br/><br/>
