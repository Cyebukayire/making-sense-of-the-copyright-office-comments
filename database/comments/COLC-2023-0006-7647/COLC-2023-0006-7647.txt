General Questions<br/><br/>1. As described above, generative AI systems have the ability to produce material that would be copyrightable if it were created by a human author. What are your views on the potential benefits and risks of this technology? How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, technology developers, researchers, and the public?<br/><br/>From the perspective of an artist, the way generative AI is developed is greatly concerning. The way data is collected and used in the creation of training datasets, without permission from the creators who made that data, for the purpose of creating commercial generative AI, is poised to cause the careers of those creators a great amount of harm. <br/><br/>In addition, I also have concerns for how the private data of the public is collected and used, and how AI may be used to spread misinformation, generate deepfakes and imitate the voices of people.<br/><br/>Training<br/><br/>9. Should copyright owners have to affirmatively consent (opt in) to the use of their works for training materials, or should they be provided with the means to object (opt out)?<br/><br/>Opt-in, and it should be clear what it is the copyright owner is agreeing to.<br/><br/>Transparency &amp; Recordkeeping<br/><br/>15. In order to allow copyright owners to determine whether their works have been used, should developers of AI models be required to collect, retain, and disclose records regarding the materials used to train their models? Should creators of training datasets have a similar obligation?<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>Copyrightability<br/><br/>18. Under copyright law, are there circumstances when a human using a generative AI system should be considered the &ldquo;author&rdquo; of material produced by the system? If so, what factors are relevant to that determination? For example, is selecting what material an AI model is trained on and/or providing an iterative series of text commands or prompts sufficient to claim authorship of the resulting output?<br/><br/>No. <br/>
