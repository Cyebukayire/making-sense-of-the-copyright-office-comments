Hello,<br/><br/>I would like to give my support to greater AI regulations. As a full-time software engineer and hobbyist artist, I have seen AI pose a threat to both me and many of my peers. If AI continues without stricter regulation, it will easily lead to a wave of joblessness and lowered quality of life for Americans nationwide. As AI improves, it has the potential to replace my job -- and my backup job as an artist -- and leave me with nothing else. I am in favor of limiting AI&#39;s use in the workplace, ensuring that AI can&#39;t be used to replace jobs, as well as continuing the precedent that AI-created media cannot be copywritten by a human.
