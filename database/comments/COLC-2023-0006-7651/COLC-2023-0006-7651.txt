Artists whose work is used to train AI or has been used by generative AI should be compensated and hold the copyright to their original works and any derivatives of their original works. <br/><br/>Anyone who uses AI to generate content of any kind should not themselves be credited as the creator or author of the content produced with AI. AI used to create content should be listed as the author of the content it generates. Any company that produces AI should be liable for any copyrights it infringes on in the process of generating content including art, writing, and other prior to human based forms of creation. <br/><br/>Human created and copyrighted content that AI trains on or utilizes in any way should be identified and listed for public view. All human creators and copyright holders of content that AI trains on or utilizes in any way should be informed immediately that their works has been viewed and used by any AI. This burden should be placed directly on companies that create AI and companies that use AI.<br/><br/>AI does not in my view generate anything original and therefore does not hold copyright or dominion over anything it produces. AI holds dominion over nothing and is a tool for basic plagiarism. Until it is possible to prove that a machine can be inspired it is not lawful to say that AI uses existing works created by humans as inspiration, therefore anything it derives from human works is technically reproduction and is subject to all existing copyright infringement laws and laws against plagiarizing work for profit.
