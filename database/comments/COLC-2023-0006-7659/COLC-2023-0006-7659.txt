Attached is my comment, though really more of a letter, to the Copyright Office in relation to their open forum on Artificial Intelligence and Copyright. I believe this issue is too wide-scale to be summarized in 5000 characters or less, therefore I am grateful to the Copyright Office for taking the time to read these letters from concerned citizens, myself included.
