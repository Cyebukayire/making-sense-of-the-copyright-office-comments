・I feel that companies should be required to disclose the datasets they use, and that they should also be required to establish an opt-out system and strict restrictions, such as opting in only.<br/><br/>・Currently, there are almost no terms and conditions regarding the use of datasets, and the return or compensation to copyright holders seems too one-sided.<br/><br/>・We agree with the establishment of appropriate licensing procedures for copyrighted materials. Obtaining permission for the use of copyrighted material when generating content using generative AI is one way to protect the rights and interests of copyright holders. If permission is not obtained, the use of generated AI should be prohibited, and strict sanctions should be imposed for violations.<br/><br/>・Copyrights should not be granted to generated images; copyright laundering will go unchecked.<br/><br/>・Also, as EMAD stated, the current image generation AI is essentially a generative search engine, and does not deserve to be copyrighted.<br/><br/>It is questionable whether the generated images are fair use, since they are already trolling the market of copyright holders, and furthermore, the output results are completely in competition with the data source.<br/><br/>The creator&#39;s name is used as a prompt for the creation of the data, and the data is heavily dependent on the input data, but the rights holders who are the source of the data do not receive any compensation and are deprived of their jobs because the market is being destroyed. I don&#39;t think that these current situations are &quot;not unfairly harmful to the interests of the rights holders of the data source.<br/><br/>I strongly feel that the current situation, where learning is a black box and no proper appeal can be made, and where companies and producers exploit copyright holders, is not human rights-oriented, and that the use of data without negotiation is not fair.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that you will move in the direction of human rights and fairness, since issues related to generative AI have no borders and many companies are in the U.S. and are taking the lead.<br/>
