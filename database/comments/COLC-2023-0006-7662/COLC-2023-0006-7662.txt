I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to PLEASE take actions that will protect the artistic works of humans, and stop the unregulated harvesting/theft by AI systems and their users. While AI and it&#39;s fans argue that AI is simply &quot;inspired&quot; by the work it ingests, the work it (AI) produces COULD NOT exist without the human-made &quot;data sets&quot; that AI is constantly siphoning without consent from human creators. If you told AI to draw a comic panel of Batman, or write a book in the style of Steven King, it has no idea what to do until it is fed human-creator-made work. It is not creative. It regurgitates. And creatives, their work, and their livelihoods should be protected from the unregulated theft by AI/it&#39;s users. At present, human creators are being forced to teach AI simply by creating work. We create something and because this creative work exists, AI is allowed to train with it. There is no consent whatsoever. This is theft. Not only of a person&rsquo;s creative style and vision (example: the many AI-made trailers in the style of Wes Anderson, or any director with a very clear, established style), but of their ability to make a living. Copyright law should protect human economic interests. Please do that.
