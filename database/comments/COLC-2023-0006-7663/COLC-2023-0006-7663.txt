I Mark Duncan an artist and 30-year veteran of the video game industry.<br/><br/>I have been a professional artist my entire adult life since graduating college in 1993. I am firmly in favor of works created through the use of Generative AI being considered to be copyrightable material. The general theme of my document is that Generative AI is simply a tool like photoshop or any other piece of artistic software. The specifics of my opinions are not overly long, but are contained with the attached pdf as they exceed the character count of this text box.<br/><br/>I am open to any questions about my document and the information contained within.
