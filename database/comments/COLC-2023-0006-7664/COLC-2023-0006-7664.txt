AI is a potentially very dangerous technology when it comes to the creative fields. I&#39;d like to put in some of my own commentary in regards to this.<br/><br/>1) Artists should ALWAYS be compensated when their work is used in AI models, and AI models that steal their work with no compensation should be completely prohibited.<br/>2) AI works should NOT receive protection under copyright law, as there is no true human factor behind creating the generated work.<br/>3) Infringing works should be at the fault of both the algorithm creators and users, as with most other copyright issues are concerned.<br/>4) AI can be used to replicate the voices and likenesses of dead actors and such, but only with the express written permission of the actor&#39;s estate. Without this, it almost feels like robbing a grave.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my input. Please take it into consideration for the final say.
