Question #1: The AI software as it is currently can not create original works of art even if operated by an artist. The creations taken with out permission from artists that own the copyright to their work make that impossible. Even the marriage of traditional art created just by the operator of the software and any other source would require vetting of usage rights from all materials involved. <br/>Question 2: Artists that work in collaborative fields like the film industry can be hurt when their work that goes to a final product such as a movie is mostly replaced by AI (not in quality but in volume). Using stolen artwork a production assistant being paid a poor wage can just by trial and error cobble together images that can be converted to physical sets and props without anyone seeing the obvious sources the designs came from.<br/>Moving on to question 5: Again we find big tech fighting to push out a product that they think they can make a profit on before all the workers and creative designers they have stolen from object to having to compete in the marketplace against their own creations. They are working hard and against time to squeeze out every available dollar until they are told to stop. The direct market for original artwork is small compared to the usage of images, mostly digital these days, for products and advertising of products by corporations that will not hesitate to carve out the low expense of hiring human artists to put more pennies in their pockets. We need the government to enforce laws already in place to protect the property rights of individuals that create and own the images that AI software makers have stolen and continue to steal.
