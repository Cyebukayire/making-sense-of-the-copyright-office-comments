1. A potential benefit would be offering artists a starting point for inspiration. For example, an artist could try a couple prompts to see what sparks their interest, essentially using the generative AI system as a tester for ideas. Once something strikes their creativity, then the artist could create their own original art piece separate from the generated images. <br/><br/>Potential risks seem more prevalent right now. There is the risk that generative AI are used to replace human creatives in their professional field, gutting the current workforce and limiting opportunities in the future. Many artists have already noticed fewer job opportunities in 2023. This feels especially harmful since the datasets used for this technology are often comprised of works these artists made. Possibly more alarming, the proliferation of generative AI makes it harder for the public to know what information comes from a human source or computer generated. This is alarming because generative AI has been known to make &quot;hallucination&quot; outputs, when the model answers with false claims. The machine does not know the consequences of spreading misinformation as it does not think like a human. It only follows the algorithm, predicting an outcome based on the data fed into it. As this technology becomes more prevalent, the public will likely grow either more suspicious or apathetic towards information around them, uncertain what sources can be trusted anymore.<br/><br/>5. I believe that while new legislation regarding AI will be necessary going forward, it will likely fall under a different office. Copyright law has already addressed that a human being is required for copyright, and that should be sufficient.<br/><br/>6. Any material posted or published online is liable to have been used to train AI models. This is done through data scraping. <br/><br/>8. Training AI should not fall under fair use. Since generative AI works by learning to imitate the data given to it, the results will by default substitute the original medium. Also, imagination is a necessary component of fair use. The computer does not have that. It might see patterns and be able to generate a remix of that data, but it does not have the human intent required to make a deliberate statement about preexisting work.<br/><br/>9. Copyright owners should be able to opt in. <br/><br/>9.1 While I believe consent should be necessary for all instances, commercial uses would be most vital to prevent copyright infringement.<br/><br/>15. Yes, I believe developers have an obligation towards transparency regarding the training material in their AI models. Copyright owners deserve to know when their work is being used. This obligation is shared with creators of training datasets, as they are the first line where copyrighted materials can fall into AI products.<br/><br/>18. No, that is not enough to determine authorship. While choosing the materials is better than nothing, the human does not make enough choices in the creative process to be considered the author. The program still determines the results.<br/><br/>20. No.<br/><br/>28. A labeling requirement would help the public determine what information is credible. Even a simple label similar to the MPA rating system might be enough.
