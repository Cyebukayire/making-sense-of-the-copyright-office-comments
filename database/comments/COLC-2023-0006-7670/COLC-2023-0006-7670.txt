I have a degree in environmental services and minors in computer science and conservation studies. I have taken multiple classes specifically in ethics for computers/technological development/engineers.<br/>A possible solution that would work for all sides of the issue would be to not allow copyrighted works to be used in AI training data. AI creators, especially for publically accessible AI, must obtain permission from the copyright owner before adding the work to their training databank, it must also be subject to random auditing by the US copyright office and/or auditing when requested by an individual or group. AI software should be banned from scraping websites they do not own/do not have express permission from website owners to scrape for training data. Pubically accessible software/websites/apps as well as paid services must disclose any collection of user data for training purposes and must allow the user to either opt in or opt out easily at any time.<br/><br/>Other suggestions:<br/>-Works must disclose if they were created in part by AI use and must include the name of the AI generation method/program or be subject to copyright infringement.<br/>-Any methods to protect one&#39;s works/creations from being added/used unlawfully by AI must be protected by law (for example, a person is not liable if they glazed their copyrighted work and an AI did not receive explicit permission to use the work and subsequently had its training data damaged by the glaze software after illegally adding it to their databank)<br/><br/>These suggestions will protect one of humanity&#39;s greatest treasures, our own creations, and the careers and futures of artists, writers, photographers, etc. from being made redundant and of no value. This will also allow AI generation and usage to continue ethically under the law and control of the US copyright office. <br/><br/>Thank you and I hope whoever reads this takes my suggestions to heart and has a nice day.
