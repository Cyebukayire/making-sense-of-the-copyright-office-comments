I am a professional illustrator in the entertainment industry. I believe that generative AI represents an existential threat to my livelihood. AI products are built on work stolen from my colleagues and myself and seek to put us out of business.  <br/><br/>The results of generative AI should not be considered copyrightable, because no matter the extent of prompting from a human user, the actual labor and result is generated by a machine, approximating a guess based on the material it has consumed. There is no human intent or labor in the creation of the result, merely a dice roll. <br/><br/>The increasing use of AI-generated material represents a massive threat to my line of work -- while AI generated images may not be better than what my colleagues and I produce, they are able to be created faster and cheaper. It is easy to imagine the cheap producer, eager to replace workers with a &quot;good enough&quot; AI product. And to this I ask, to what end? Is there a demand for more media made faster and cheaper? Is the elimination of entire career sectors a good thing for citizens, the economy, and creativity?<br/><br/>Here is a paper on the effects of AI in the art industry: https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3600211.3604681<br/><br/>Legislation regulating AI should require all existing generative AI algorithms that do not use public domain or consensually-obtained data to be algorithmically disgorged / destroyed, and companies should be required to start over with datasets that are fair, ethical and legal.  Datasets used by AI products must have consent of the creators of the works ingested, credit those creators, compensate those creators, and be transparent about the contents of their datasets and how they were acquired.
