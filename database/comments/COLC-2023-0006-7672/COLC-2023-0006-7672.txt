Hello. I am writing as a concerned American, a writer, a science communicator, and an artist. The recent expansion in use of machine learning algorithms that are developed from scraped, unauthorized access to publicly and privately available content is deeply troubling to me. Furthermore, the lack of protection afforded the producers and consumers alike of this material. Furthermore, the lack of regulation enables the use of AI or machine learning to generate profit from the unlicensed and unauthorized --stolen-- work of hardworking Americans. Already, people are unable to support themselves as businesses turn to AI rather than paying for skilled labor. There must be regulation and oversight for this burgeoning technology, or it will be used to further detriment those already in the most precarious situations.
