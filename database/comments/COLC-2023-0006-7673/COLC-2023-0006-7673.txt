I&#39;m writing this at just after getting back from the hospital where my friend was being treated, we got there at 12am and we left at 8:30am. It was the only one open in my state because of system malfunctions in every other hospital. <br/><br/>Before computers were what they are today, people theorized that future computers would do all the stuff we don&#39;t want to do. But instead, the DMV is still open, hospital mainframes still go down, and we&#39;re all still sitting at our desk jobs while we have AI doing the all the sought-after creative work such as: writing film scripts, making art, music, etc. These jobs are NOT in high demand, we have a surplus of people working very hard to make a living off these. There&#39;s no reason to make a robot do them, especially when they&#39;re high jacking the artists&#39; work!<br/><br/>I&#39;m not suggesting we get robots to be nurses or doctors, but we need utilize AI to make these jobs easier. Why do we have robots that are capable of finding out anything we need to know about something as irrelevant as the history of pumpkins in a split second, meanwhile people are dying in hospitals because of errors in the system? <br/><br/>I make music that is loved by nearly everyone that hears it. I don&#39;t recall ever doing a show or open mic in which a stranger didn&#39;t compliment my work. Knowing this, if I Ever lost a Grammy to a plagiarizing robot, I&#39;m going to boycot and encourage family, friends, and fans to do the same. No matter how convenient it gets, we will find a way to avoid it. We didn&#39;t have AI for over 99% of civilization, we are cable of living without it. <br/><br/>I cant finish my plea without mentioning what many others will write, AI is a threat to our privacy, and our mental health. It&#39;s creating paranoia, and causing us anxiety knowing our doorbells, and our phones are able to listen to us whenever the tech giants feel like it. The number of mental health related hospitalizations has skyrocketed since social media emerged, and it has exploded even further in the past 4 years since AI has made a bigger name for itself. <br/><br/>As far as copyright infringement goes, I am strongly against robots being allowed to scan internet and archives to help them create anything, be it music, writing, visual art, etc. The fact that there&#39;s no legalization against this act fills me with despair. This is a fast growing problem that must be stopped immediately.
