I&#39;m a musician, programmer, and writer. I&#39;ve used what you might call AI for over a decade now, through dating websites, Amazon, YouTube, and other systems that attempt to predict things I do. Most recently, I&#39;ve used ChatGPT; community-trained models called GPT4All and Vicuna 13b (llama.cpp); the voice/audio transformer SoftVC VITS; and the image models StyleGAN2 and RealESRGAN. I&#39;ve trained models on my own data, but most of my models have been trained on data scraped from the web. I haven&#39;t made any money from my work. Everything I&#39;ve done has just been for learning and fun, and I would like to preface what I&#39;m writing by saying that I hope nothing stands in the way of doing that in the future! Learning, creativity, and materially responsible technological development are good for all.<br/><br/>The question of authorship of generative AI outputs is something that shouldn&#39;t necessarily be in question at this moment in time, for the simple reason that all AI, as we currently think of it, is trained on human-generated inputs. The extent to which output is or isn&#39;t representative of human input is irrelevant, because it&#39;s entirely constructed on human input. AIs don&#39;t actually originate anything at all. They are designed to conform to whatever is demanded from them via their prompt. They finish their input, like any generative system, but the Copyright Office has correctly identified that the real difference in question here is the use of copyrighted input data and, to some extent - fidelity.<br/><br/>Anyone whose data is incorporated into the training data of an AI - or even the second-hand output of an AI that is used to train another AI, as I experienced with an assistant model called GPT4All which is trained on the output of ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo - should be compensated for the use of that data. Details of the data used should also be publicly released.<br/><br/>In addition to the question of authorship, I have to point out that the exact decision-making process of most, if not all AIs, is unknown. Most people refer to that as a &quot;black box&quot;, and developers will openly agree. AI models must be assumed to be building on their entire repertoire at once - their entire training set - at any given time. We can&#39;t actually know whether a prompt asking for &quot;a puppy in the style of Picasso&quot; is exclusively relying on pictures of puppies and Picasso. Not to dig too deeply into this topic, but this is similar to the idea of superposition, exemplified in Schr&ouml;dinger&#39;s cat. Because we can&#39;t possibly know how the system has decided what it outputs - what is measured - we have to assume the system is in all states at once. There is no point at this time in trying to quantify exactly how much of certain works were used in each piece; from what I understand, this is fundamentally unknowable.<br/><br/>I also have to point out the similarities between the free use of copyrighted materials in AI to the current free use and sale of various kinds of consumer data. Data brokers, corporations, and even nonprofits in America sell and trade consumer data (such as purchases, search engine queries, and browsing activity) with precious little legal regulation. Consumers receive no compensation and must legally defend themselves when their data is sold illegitimately, which most don&#39;t have the ability to do. They receive no notice when a sale has taken place. This data is used to target advertisements, political propaganda, and place consumers in immutable categories based on totally automatic judgements by an algorithm (or an AI, which is just a fancy algorithm at this moment in history). We have never made a legal assertion that this kind of data is copyrightable. However the kind of data the Copyright Office is discussing in this notice very much is.<br/><br/>I would like to live in a world where art is universal, technology is simply a tool to advance mankind for good, and profit is shared collectively, but right now AI is only used at mass scale by entities who stand to profit from the lack of regulation. Until such a day, please help add some transparency and potential property rights. <br/><br/>Thanks for your time!
