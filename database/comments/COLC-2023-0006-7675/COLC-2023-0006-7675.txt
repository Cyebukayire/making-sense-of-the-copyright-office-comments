As an illustrator since 2006,I, as well as every other practicing artist, will attest to the fact that even before the introduction of A.I., the art field has never been an easy profession to make a living. With that said, without governmental protections for artists and their art, the profession will be functionally killed by A.I. and its adjacent technologies.
