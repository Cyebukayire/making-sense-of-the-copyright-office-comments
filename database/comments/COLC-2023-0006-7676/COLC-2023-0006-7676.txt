This submission is addressed to the questions posed by the Copyright Office concerning Copyrightability of AI-generated content, questions 18 through 21. It proposes that the US Copyright Act be amended to include a sui generis regime for protection of AI-generated content.  As discussed in detail in the document attached, key features of the proposal include (1) that AI-created works be protected for a shorter duration (50 years from creation), (2) that such work must be registered with the Copyright Office in order to receive copyright protection, and (3) the person to be acknowleged as the author or coauthor of such works ought be either (A) the user of a software application or hosted AI platform responsible for prompting and generating the actual work, or (B) the person or entity in a &quot;work made for hire&quot; relationship with such user.
