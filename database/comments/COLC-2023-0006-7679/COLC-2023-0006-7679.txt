Having been trained as an illustrator and graphic designer, I see AI as nothing more than an effort by those less skilled to plagiarize the creative works of persons such as myself.  Art should not be commercialized in this fashion.  Art should remain as a form of individual expression not to be used by random individuals for their own purposes and profit.  AI should be regulated, just as the music industry has been over the years.
