Subject: Support for Fair Use in AI Training and Concerns About the Burden on Individuals and Small Businesses<br/><br/>I am writing to express my views on the recent Notice of Inquiry (NOI) issued by the U.S. Copyright Office concerning copyright and artificial intelligence (AI). As an individual with a small computer consulting business focused on building AI models, I have a vested interest in the outcome of this inquiry and the potential legislative or regulatory steps that may be taken as a result.<br/><br/>AI Training as Fair Use:<br/><br/>The use of copyrighted works to train AI models is a transformative process that enhances the capabilities of AI technology, ultimately benefiting various industries and society as a whole. This practice is comparable to human learning, where individuals read and learn from copyrighted material to gain knowledge. Just as a person does not infringe on copyright by quoting or referencing small portions of text, AI models should not be considered in violation of copyright for utilizing existing works during their training phase.<br/><br/>A prime example of a country taking a stance in support of this practice is Japan, where it has recently been declared that using datasets for training AI models doesn&rsquo;t violate copyright law. Japanese law allows model trainers to gather publicly available data without having to license or secure permission from the data owners, which is a logical and progressive stance that promotes innovation. Japan&#39;s policy permits AI to utilize any data, whether the intention is for non-profit or commercial use, or for activities other than reproduction. This bold stance reaffirms Japan&rsquo;s commitment to becoming a leader in AI technology.<br/><br/>Undue Burden on Small Businesses:<br/><br/>The potential requirement to pay licensing fees for the use of copyrighted material in AI training poses a significant burden on small businesses and individuals like myself. Paying for licenses for millions of documents and images would be financially unfeasible for small entities, effectively locking us out of this burgeoning field of technology.<br/><br/>This would result in a monopolistic environment where only large corporations with the necessary legal and financial resources could participate in AI development. This is counterintuitive to the spirit of innovation and progress that AI represents.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if Japan and other countries do not enforce copyright on materials used for training AI, while the USA does, this will give a significant advantage to AI businesses based in Japan and other countries that adopt a similar approach to copyright and training of AI. This will place a significant burden on AI businesses based in the USA such as my AI consulting business, which will significantly disadvantage and hinder the development of AI technologies by businesses based in the USA.<br/><br/>Acquisition of Legal Copies:<br/><br/>In many cases, individuals and small businesses already possess legal copies of the copyrighted material, be it through purchases, subscriptions, visits to the public or college library, visiting art museums or legally accessible online content. These materials should be freely usable for AI training without additional licensing fees.<br/><br/>The availability of Creative Commons licensed materials online further supports the case for fair use, as these resources are meant to be freely used and shared for the purpose of promoting creativity and knowledge.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to consider the implications that restrictive regulations and licensing requirements would have on small businesses and individual developers. The fair use doctrine should be preserved and expanded upon to support the growth and development of AI technologies that have the potential to benefit society as a whole.
