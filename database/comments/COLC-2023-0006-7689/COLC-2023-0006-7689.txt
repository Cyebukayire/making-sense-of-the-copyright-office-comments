Hello, I believe that AI must be regulated by making sure generative AI media is considered public domain and not allowed to obtain a profit. That and official AI image generators used by corporations are not allowed to use widely available images from artists doing active commissions and other businesses, freelance artists, as well as hobby artists on social media. Also AI images must not especially be used for profit if they are obviously dependent on another artist without their consent. We hope that the coming regulations will prevent AI from hurting the job market as well as prevent illegal practices such as deepfaking an actual person without consent. Thank you.
