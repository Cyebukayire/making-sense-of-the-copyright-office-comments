I think there should be laws governing the use, distribution, and creation of all AI-generated content. Whether we realize it or not, AI impedes copyright law principles such as authorship, infringement, and fair use. It can also have a detrimental effect on the youth and young adults of today. One TikToker, going by the alias &quot;Rachel&quot;, shared her harrowing experience at the hands of anonymous social media users who have used artificial intelligence tools to generate fake nude images of her before sending these images to her and other online users (https://www.todayonline.com/world/trending-tiktoker-fake-nude-ai-images-herself-begs-stop-2165081). In another instance, teenage girls in the Spanish town of Almendralejo began to come home telling their parents of disturbing encounters with classmates, some of whom were claiming to have seen naked photos of them. Earlier this year, the FBI warned of an uptick in the use of AI-generated deepfakes for such &ldquo;sextortion&rdquo; schemes, confirming that the agency is receiving reports from victims &ldquo;including minor children&quot; (https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-explicit-material-twitter-big-tech-1234855484/). Content creators have even used such tools to make AI-generated vocals of music artists singing, some even going as far as to create drawings and other such graphics using AI, and selling them. There should be laws clearly defining what you can and cannot do with AI, as well as consequences to match.
