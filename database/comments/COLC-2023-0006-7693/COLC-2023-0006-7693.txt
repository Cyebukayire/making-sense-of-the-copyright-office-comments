The importance of copyright to artists like me cannot be overstated. Giving tech companies carte blanche to appropriate copyrighted creative works for AI digestion and regurgitation would so cheapen the work of us living artists as to render our work socially and economically worthless. AI-driven reinterpretations of living artists&#39; work is already diminishing artists&#39; incomes, while enriching tech industry executives for what are essentially rampant copyright violations on a staggering scale. Put simply, such AI-generated art is theft. It is piracy. AI art, if it can be called art, is not the same thing as human inspiration, and it is not the same thing as a human artists referencing creative influences in their own works: In the case of a human artist who borrows too liberally from the copyrighted work of others, there are well-established intellectual property laws to protect ownership and income rights over the works in question. In this light, and simply because it is the moral thing to do, I implore the US Copyright Office to hold the line on the legal standard of copyright and to protect human artists from AI intellectual property theft. The simplest way to do this would be to strictly prohibit generative AI companies from using any copyrighted works without permission for any machine learning AI training.<br/><br/>Thank you for providing this open comment period on this existentially important issue for artists. And thank you for your time.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nevada Jones, composer
