9) Artists and writers should have to opt-in to have their works used included in an image generator&#39;s training set. Otherwise, it would be an unreasonable burden on artists to try to opt-out their work. Copyright law requires the permission of the owner to use their work. This should be no different.<br/><br/>13) The economy is currently fine without widespread use of image generators or text generators. It will continue to be fine without them. It will benefit artists and writers if such generators are strictly regulated. As we&#39;ve seen from the WGA strike this year, company owners want to reduce or eliminate artists&#39; and writers&#39; positions from their projects in order to keep more of the profits for themselves. This hurts the economy (rich people hoarding wealth) and artists and writers (can&#39;t find jobs).<br/><br/>18) No, collecting a dataset and writing prompts for the ai generators IS NOT the same as artists and writers actually creating something. <br/><br/>And finally, works created by image or text generators should not be eligible for copyright. We&#39;re already seeing decisions like this and it should continue.
