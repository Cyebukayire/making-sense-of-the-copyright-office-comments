To maintain trust and credibility of any organization, product, content, service, or person, full transparency and disclosure of the use of any generative AI is required. Today, many responsible media outlets have outlined their AI policies and will include a sentence that &quot;this article was created with generative AI&quot;. Additional transparency in disclosing the specific AI tool used and how it was used to create the content is necessary for consumer awareness and protection. This level of specific transparency is also necessary due to the large amount of biases detected in these early stage tools. For example, a TV show or a news article that says &quot;written by ChatGPT 3.0 by typing in this prompt [x]&quot; is necessary. Just like scientific publications, any use of AI should be reproducible so somebody else should be able to re-create the same content by using a similar prompt or series of prompts in the same version of the generative AI tool.<br/><br/>This transparency in policy will help mature these nascent products into more accurate models that do not have such clear gender, race, or other biases. I agree with the Office&#39;s outcome in the registration application example of 2022 where an applicant had a graphic novel with Midjourney generated images. However, Midjourney was recently discovered to have serious challenges with portraying &quot;Black doctors treating white patients,&quot; as published in The Lancet, a well-regarded British scientific journal. These types of biased images need to be either regulated or the human author using them must be held liable for the images they choose to use. <br/>Source: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(23)00329-7/fulltext<br/><br/>In addition, any AI-generated work must provide credits or citations to all the works, especially the copyrighted works, from which the AI tool created the information. Any systems or databases that train generative AI large language models must first receive permission from the copyrighted works they&#39;re using and/or pay for it, similar to paying a royalty fee for a song clip or using someone&#39;s likeness.<br/><br/>Regarding whether AI works can be copyrighted, I believe the answer is that the &quot;work&quot; is essentially human authorship, and AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, with a few exceptions. If substantial significant changes are made to an AI-generated work by a human, then it could potentially be considered &quot;human&quot; authorship again and therefore copyrightable. The reason AI-generated works should not be copyrighted is simply due to the underlying science and technology of generative AI. It works using a probabilistic model, where it searches for the next &quot;most likely&quot; word or image and thus builds a very &quot;natural&quot; language-based answer. However, all it is doing is mining the databases and information it was trained on, which were all written by humans (until now). There is no &quot;creative&quot; aspect of the work. A different combination of words in the user prompt that a human provides will lead to a different combination of &quot;most likely&quot; words/images that the AI model spits out. Thus, while two pieces of AI work might be different from each other, that difference is mathematical, based on probabilities and statistics. It is not &quot;novel&quot; or &quot;original&quot; in a creative sense. <br/><br/>A phrase like &quot;generated by&quot; could be used to describe the use of AI in a work, but not &quot;written&quot; or &quot;illustrated&quot;.
