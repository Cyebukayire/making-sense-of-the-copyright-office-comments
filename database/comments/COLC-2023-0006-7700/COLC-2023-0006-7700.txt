Working as a professional artist for over 45 years and a professional member of The Animation Guild and the Art Directors Guild I can&#39;t believe that there is any serious debate over whether AI should be considered art in the same breath as art created by real artists/humans. Files (I won&#39;t call it art) created by machine learning/AI should have no standing in the art community or be allowed copyright since it could not exist without the scraping and theft of art from human artists
