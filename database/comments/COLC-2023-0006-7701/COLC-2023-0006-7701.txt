Ai art is an automaton not a tool.<br/><br/>The automaton of human creativity is a mistake.<br/><br/>-Training;<br/>Opt Out isn&#39;t a solution, it&#39;s almost impossible to opt out, as you can only do it one model at a time, and they could have multiples of your artworks from differents sources in the datasets (instagram, twitter, websited, people resharing your art, ect..)<br/><br/>It should be opt in, by default.<br/>If you really cannot make these machines opt in, then they shouldn&#39;t be allowed for commercial use, at all.<br/><br/>I do not want my art in these machines 100 years down the line, when my copyright protection will expire.<br/>We would meet the same problem of automating creativity, and the new generations would suffer from it.<br/><br/>From my observations of my environnement, because of ML, a lot of youngs have put the pens and papers down, be it for writing, learning or drawing, they do not feel like making anything anymore, and that dangerous for their mental health, as well as their critical thinking and developpement.<br/><br/>You should check on them, they&#39;re very depressed and see even less hope in the future than before.<br/><br/>Artists also do not share as much on socials medias or blogs anymore, making art private because of the fear of AI training on their works.<br/><br/>-Transparency and recordkeeping;<br/>Shutterstock as trained AI on their photographers&#39; pictures, and they&#39;re paying these photographers pennies for using their works without consent.<br/><br/>-Copyrightability;<br/><br/>You should never be allowed to copyright AI content, as the human output is minimal.<br/><br/>-The misinformation and disinformation issues;<br/><br/>This one is the bit funny, but actually not so much.<br/><br/>There is this super popular K-pop group called BTS, they have a lot of fans. Recently an AI model was made to produce what seems at first (even second!) glance, classic pictures of the group&#39;s members. Now with such a big fanbase you can imagine that even if everyone isn&#39;t on board with ML, there are still going to be a lot of images produced.<br/>I don&#39;t know if this ever going to be read by someone, but at that moment in time if you go on twitter, and type &quot;ai pinterest&quot; you will see somes of the fans complaining they can&#39;t even find real photos of the group anymore. The sheer quantity and rapidity at which these can be made, has now flooded pinterest and google search with fakes.<br/><br/>Imagine if these were backed up by companies who have the means to put them at the forefront of every platform. Pushing real creatives at the bottom, not giving them even the chance to be seen. It&#39;s already happening right now because of the quantity but it could be even worse.<br/><br/>Pinterest is slowly dying, nothing is real there anymore, you want to search for shoes? More than half of them are AI, same for interior design, rooms, furnitures, characters designs,celebrities, people, art and so on. You can add the scams too.<br/>Google image isn&#39;t doing better. It doesn&#39;t affects only artists, it affects everyone.<br/>It&#39;s not even been a year and it already is difficult to search for something.<br/><br/>-Disinformation;<br/><br/>Israel and Palestine;<br/>  How many AI pictures I&#39;ve seen used as a mean to manipulate opinion? It&#39;s bad. And it&#39;s so easy to make.<br/>People have fell for these. We artists can detect them more easily, for now, but the average person doesn&#39;t.<br/><br/>We need tags and watermarks. I think I heard Emad Mostaque from stabilityAI talk about an invisible watermark, but to be honest I don&#39;t trust him, and it would be better if the average person could identify AI at a glance, not just a website through the codes.<br/><br/>I think china has somes AI models that automatically put watermarks with the name of the model as well as a number on the image generated.<br/>Even though somes watermarks can be removed by photoshop, a lot of people aren&#39;t motivated enough to do it. Specialy if it&#39;s those one with lines and patterns that take the whole picture. See Shutterstock watermarks as exemples.<br/><br/>As you read this, you must have easily figured out writing isn&#39;t my speciality. And I thank you for even taking the time to skim through it.<br/>Have a nice day, and I hope decisions that benefit us all on the path to being happy (not just alive) will be taken.
