I&rsquo;m a member of the WGA (Writers Guild) and also a venture capital investor in AI/ML start-up companies. My film production company, End Cue has developed and patented workflow software based on AI models that allow producers to ingest screenplays and generate script coverage, schedules and a preliminary budget. Training these AI models should NOT require the writer&rsquo;s consent just like large language model developers like OpenAI, Anthropic and Stability AI are trained on the public internet. The clear demarkation of consent should relate to generative AI, not training models anonymously to build workflow and productivity tooling.
