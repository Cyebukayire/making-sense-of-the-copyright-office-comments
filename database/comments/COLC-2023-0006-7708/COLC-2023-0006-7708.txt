Stories are as old as humans, and our greatest tool for understanding ourselves, both on a social level and the depths of an individual. For all of the world&#39;s automation, this is one vocation that can not and should not be delegated to a machine, for fear that we may lose our way as people.  Stories are humanity&#39;s mirror, and humans are not algorithms, nor do we want to become one.  Our stories must come from the heart of an individual so that it can speak to the heart of another.
