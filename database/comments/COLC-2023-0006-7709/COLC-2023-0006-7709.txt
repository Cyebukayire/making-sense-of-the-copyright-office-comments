Hello, I am an emmy-nominated kids&#39; TV writer and I have thoughts about AI and copyright which I hope you will consider. After logging hundreds of hours with AI-- text, chat, image generation, audio generation, video generation-- it&#39;s clear to me that our institutions and copyright laws MUST keep up with this new technology. Since AI is fueled by the collective public output of our society, anything derived from that data set should belong to the collective public. I believe AI should be treated like a PUBLIC GOOD, and that anything created by AI should be FREE TO USE FOR ALL IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. Because of AI&#39;s foundational nature of having been derived from public data sets, its entire output must therefor be considered derivative and a priori must be considered public domain.
