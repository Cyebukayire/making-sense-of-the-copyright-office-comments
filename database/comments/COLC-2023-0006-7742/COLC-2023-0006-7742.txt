Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>As a member of the Writers Guild of America West, I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. While the new WGA agreement contains important protections prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work, it cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining.<br/><br/>We need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Since film and television writers are employee, we predominantly create works for hire. It means we are NOT copyright holders of the work we create. We need to be protected by statute, just like other rightsholders to consent to the use of our work to train AI models. And need to be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. <br/><br/>AI technology in its current state possesses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration and truly hope you will take our concerns seriously. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nik Robinson<br/>Studio City, CA
