Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a writer and a filmmaker, and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to protect human creativity and creative workers like me during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. We need public policy solutions to protect our jobs, our art and the soul of creativity as we know it.<br/><br/>AI models that train on human art and use that training to generate &quot;art&quot; of their own cannot be granted the same copyright protections humans have. That AI &quot;art&quot; Is not uniquely created work -- it&#39;s simply a very complicated photocopy of existing, copyrighted work done by human artists who have not consented to its use in this new field.<br/><br/>Art is foundational to the human experience, whether it&#39;s creating, participating or observing. We cannot allow that experience to become commodified by technology against the wishes of the artists whose work it&#39;s replicating. AI as it&#39;s currently being implemented poses a profound threat to millions of creative workers and billions of people who benefit from human-created artwork.<br/><br/>Please take this opportunity to use the power of the Copyright Office to protect artists and audiences. Thank you for your consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Shawn Wines<br/>Los Angeles, CA
