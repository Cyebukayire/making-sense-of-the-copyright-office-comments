Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>Hello! I&#39;d like to be as transparent as possible about A.I. <br/><br/>It is a tool of theft, right now, in the hands of studios and corporations. A.I. is inherently built on stealing work and art from humans, with no compensation, by anti-working class corporations, so they can further oppress and suppress wages for writers and creatives. <br/><br/>No studio or company within Hollywood -- or the industry -- has in any way shown they will respect writers since none of us are informed when they used our screenplays and writing to steal from us -- and I need to say this again -- they are not teaching the A.I. -- they are not training the A.I. -- they are simply stealing previously created work from people -- and acting like it&#39;s inherently theirs to do whatever they like. <br/><br/>Allow the C-suite, bourgeoisie, anti-working class corporations to control and copyright A.I. means that America is 100% okay with corporations stealing from the poor and working class. This is already undeniably true in America -- but here&#39;s your chance to stop even further exploitation. <br/><br/>No company and no studio should be able to copyright A.I., ever, unless they are forced to perpetually pay every single person they&#39;ve stolen content from to &quot;teach&quot; (it&#39;s not teaching, it&#39;s stealing and intellectual theft) their A.I. <br/><br/>That is the only way this is fair. Do not give corporations and studios the ability to continue to steal from creatives -- while not uplifting them. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Xavier B<br/>Los Angeles, CA
