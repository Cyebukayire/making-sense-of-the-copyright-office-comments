Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>From the age of five years old, films and books have been an important part of my life. I learned how to speak English from watching movies. I learned about different ethnicities and world views and what it meant to be an American. In all that time I was accumulating a diverse and ever growing palate to draw from later in life when I would become a professional screenwriter. The countless ours spent watching, reading, and analyzing past art in film and novels along with my own life experiences allowed me to find a unifying through line about life that transcends the boundaries of time in creating my own art. What has taken me years of self-sacrifice and dedication can easily be emulated with the emergence of a soulless and dangerous technology which reduces the entire human endeavor to a data point to be absorbed and replicated. This will not only lend itself to making human art obsolete but in a very Kafkaesque way man himself. I urge you to not let this technology lose into the art realm for it invades man&rsquo;s God given prerogative to create. Creation is the realm of God and mankind whom He has bestowed it onto, not Artificial Intelligence. AI is the proverbial Pandora&rsquo;s Jar that must not be opened. Restrain and hold back at all cost AI intruding into human art. With that, I leave you with the standard template letter from the WGA which elaborates more on the dangers of AI:<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America West and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Benhur Ablakhad<br/>Palmdale, CA
