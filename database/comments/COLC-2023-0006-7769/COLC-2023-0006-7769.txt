Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America West and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>In addition to the above I can&#39;t emphasize strongly enough that this idea, the idea of falsely constructing human thoughts and feelings for profit and gain, is precisely and directly akin to the 3/5s compromise and continuing race slavery made in the US constitution. This idea of AI writing emerges from a concept of the primary purpose of the United States as being for commerce and profit -- not for the sanctity of human equality and human life.  It is a drastic and poisonous continuation down the path of valuing property over life and I will do all I can to not participate in slave-thought driven business models. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nick Gillie<br/>Studio City, CA
