Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America West and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize American creativity and this nation&#39;s creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>To be clear: AI models do not GENERATE art. They STEAL bits and pieces of art created by professional and amateur artists and reassemble them. Currently, any profits from this theft go exclusively to tech companies who have already eroded the integrity of our legal system, our news media, and our government itself. Despite their nonsensical sales pitches about social media and tech &quot;connecting people,&quot; these tech companies&#39; only goal is to make money, and they do not ever weigh collateral damage from their tinkering with human behavior until it is too late to change course. They do not care if entire American industries are destroyed in their heedless and irresponsible quest for &quot;disruption.&quot;<br/><br/>AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. From a legal standpoint, AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. <br/><br/>The U.S. Media and Entertainment (M&amp;E) industry is the largest in the world. In 2022, the market size of the Arts, Entertainment and Recreation industry in the US was $378.9 billion. Please consider legislation protecting this all-important American industry from the very real threat that AI poses.<br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Alex Gregory<br/>Los Angeles, CA
