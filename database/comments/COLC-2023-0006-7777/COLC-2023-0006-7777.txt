Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America West and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright.<br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on thought, feeling and lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat not only to writers and other creative workers, but to all consumers of art, music and stories; who will be made to consume copies of copies of human output borne not out of any need for expression nor will to stimulate or entertain, but out of cynical algorithm-generated assessments of what types of content will garner the most clicks at a certain time. We need to protect ourselves and all future generations against an unstoppable tidal wave of content that will inevitably and absolutely erode any meager shred of taste and intelligence that we still have. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Max Saltarelli<br/>Los Angeles, CA
