Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>As a member of the Writers Guild of America West, I write to you today not just fearful of the obvious existential threat to screenwriters posed by AI, but to the country at large.<br/><br/>AI, if allowed to ingest copyrighted material, will put screenwriters out of business. Then it will put actors out of business. Then directors. Then novelists. Painters. Musicians.<br/><br/>Art and creativity will, in just a few short years, cease to exist as a profession in the United States.<br/><br/>First, the long history of American arts and artists will no longer shape and create our culture, but it will instead be shaped and created by whichever foreign agents (e.g. China) are first and most reckless in stealing our work. American artistry will be scraped for parts, reconfigured, and sold back to us, infused with God knows what sorts of nefarious and anti-American themes.<br/><br/>Beyond that, we will have lost something even more priceless, which is the empathy, goodwill, and community that arises when one person speaks and another listens. That is the essence of art - the artist emits and the audience receives, discusses, debates, considers... To remove humans from one half of the equation is to move us one giant step closer to a dystopian future where we are all - audiences as well as artists - alone, adrift, and hopeless.<br/><br/>I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright.<br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Joseph Epstein<br/>Los Angeles, CA
