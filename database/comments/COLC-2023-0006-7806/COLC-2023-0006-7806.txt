Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America West and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. I just asked ChatGPT to write a joke in my voice and this is what it responded:<br/><br/>ChatGPT: &quot;Why did the grammar teacher break up with the dictionary? Because it had too many &#39;ex-amples&#39; from the past, and it couldn&#39;t stop correcting their &#39;their,&#39; &#39;there,&#39; and &#39;they&#39;re&#39; issues!&quot;<br/><br/>This is not even close to a joke. It is a weird twist on a joke I once wrote about a thesaurus. The only reason ChatGPT could spit this out is because the model was trained using my books and scripts. How is this fair? WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nell Scovell<br/>Friday Harbor, WA
