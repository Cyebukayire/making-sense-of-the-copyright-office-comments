Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>Hello!<br/>I want to add my thoughts with regard to AI-generated work.  They&#39;re not terribly original, I&#39;m sure - but...well, just like AI-generated work!!  <br/><br/>The primary elements of the WGA/AI situation are these: 1. Our work, for better or worse, comes from our own minds, hearts, imaginations, and spirits.  Though much of it has to pass through corporate chompers before it gets produced, it nonetheless begins with us.  2. Famously, nothing &quot;comes from&quot; AI, in the same way; material is synthesized, digested, integrated and spit out.  3. Because of the way our business is structured, we - the undisputed (except maybe by directors...) creators of our work, do not hold copyright on it.  4. We ARE registered under the &quot;Created by&quot; or &quot;Written by&quot; rubrics.<br/><br/>It seems to me, then, that AI work - which is an amalgam of already copyrighted or acknowledged &quot;created by/written by&quot; work, should not be granted primary copyright protection on its own. That should always and only belong to actual human source creators and/or the studios that produce their work directly.  While AI-generated work should be treated like a photograph that is not specifically composed as a piece of art, but rather is just a picture of pre-existing materials.<br/><br/>Thanks!!  These are such big questions - with such big implications for all of us...  Glad you&#39;re investing time and resources in considering how to proceed.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Susan Baronoff<br/>Venice, CA
