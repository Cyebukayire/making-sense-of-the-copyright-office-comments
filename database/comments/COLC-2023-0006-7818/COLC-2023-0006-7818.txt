Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m a member of the Writers Guild of America West. I represented the Guild in the USCO listening session on May 19, 2023, sharing our view that copyright is intended to protect authors, not corporations, and that conversations about AI and copyright need to center the the originators of the work, not just copyright holders. <br/><br/>At the time of my testimony, the WGA was on strike, in part over AI concerns. The successful conclusion of our 148-day strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for all creative workers. I&rsquo;m proud that the new WGA agreement offers important protections for writers on AI, but we cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining. We need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>As I testified in May, I believe AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. AI models feed upon the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. It&rsquo;s fancy plagiarism, but it&rsquo;s still plagiarism. AI technology as it is currently being implemented and (un-)regulated poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments, and the ongoing work you&rsquo;re doing.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>John August<br/>Los Angeles, CA
