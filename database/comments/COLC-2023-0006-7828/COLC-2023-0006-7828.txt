Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. <br/><br/>It&#39;s vital that the USCO safeguard artists&#39; rights, work and professions. Machine-generated creative works cannot be protected by copyright law. As the WGA writer&#39;s strike earlier this demonstrated, this is an urgent and existential issue. The future of our livelihoods are at stake. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Scott McCabe<br/>Pasadena, CA
