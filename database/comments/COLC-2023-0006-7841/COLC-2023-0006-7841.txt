Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America. I&#39;m also a novelist. I just found out that the three novels my writing partner Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and I wrote have been utilized by Bloomberg, Meta, and others to &#39;teach&#39; their AI. They did not contact us, much less pay us for the privilege of using our hard work for their gain.<br/><br/>I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Anna Waterhouse<br/>CA
