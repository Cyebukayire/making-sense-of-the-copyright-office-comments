Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am a professional writer who makes a living writing work for the web and television. Given that the purpose of copyright is to give value to intellectual work done by human beings it seems quite obvious to not grant copyright to works generated by non-humans. And, given that LLM-based generative AI-products scrape from intellectual property that is under copyright, it seems obvious to me that the authors of those works should be compensated or, if that is impossible, than the work generated should be unable to generate profit as a piece of intellectual property. <br/><br/>In every professional setting I am in, for example making a graphic for a television show, I must follow very strict standards for sourcing and use of any copyrighted images or text I use. It makes no sense to hold tech companies to a different standard merely because the copyright theft they have done is at a scale so large it is unenforceable. I could see an argument for fair use if these LLM tools are being created in academic settings or are free to use to the public. However, that is clearly not the aim of many of the companies creating these tools. Instead I will be forced to compete in the market of intellectual products with the products of these companies while having a fraction of their resources and being forced to follow much stricter rules. This seems against the entire purpose of copyright and intellectual property.<br/><br/>In addition to that, even if I were to create a profit-generating show that presented photos, text or art published by regular people that has been posted to internet message boards and platforms, I would need to ask permission and, usually, offer compensation. I am not sure why work created by LLMs would be subjected to a different standard here as well.<br/><br/>If it is indeed true that there is no way to properly credit and remunerate the sources of images and text generated by these machines then I think the only possible recourse is that anything they generate should be &quot;born&quot; into the public domain and unable to be eligible for copyright. Likely the same should be true for works that use a substantive mixture of AI and human generation. <br/><br/>I would actually propose it is more beneficial and logical that art and text that has been generated from a machine that has scraped all of humanities artistic work SHOULD then be free of ownership and copyright and given back to the public from whence it came.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Matt Klinman<br/>Los Angeles, CA
