Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Generative artificial intelligence is by its very basis an unoriginal mode of expression. It derives the substance of every response to a prompt from scouring the Internet for existing material, much of which already exists under U.S. copyright protection. Without any means of tracking or identifying copyrighted material within the responses given by ChatGPT or other GAI tools, we have no way of respecting the copyrights of those rights holders. There need to be regulatory tools, known in some circles as Ethical AI, to be able to track and attribute copyrighted material wherever it is used, and in turn, those rights holders deserve to be compensated for any use of their copyrighted material in creating any new works, whether this is literary or artistic in nature. As a writer, I am deeply concerned about the use of AI in attempting to &quot;create&quot; any new material when it is in fact deriving this material from copyrighted works. I urge you to consider stronger copyright protections for any works on the Internet, particularly when these are used for commercial &quot;repurposing&quot; by AI. In addition, as the Writers Guild of America has espoused, there should never be copyright given to a non-human creator of any sort. These protections are necessary for preserving the sustainability of the arts in all forms. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Josh Chesler<br/>Culver City, CA
