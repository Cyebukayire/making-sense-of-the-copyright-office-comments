Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the WGA (Writers Guild of America) and I&#39;m also a writer of fiction with more than a dozen books of fiction published--at least ten of which have been &quot;mined&quot; and used to train AI. I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. As a fiction writer and WGA member I ask for writers to be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models. I also feel writers should be compensated fairly if we choose to allow our work to be used to train AI--I have not seen a dime despite all my fiction that has been used to train AI. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Brian Evenson<br/>Valencia, CA
