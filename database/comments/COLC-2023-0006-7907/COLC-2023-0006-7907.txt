As an author of school textbooks, I derive my livelihood from the sale of copyrighted materials. I have also been required throughout my career to pay strong attention to rights and permissions, and to make sure that copyright material was only ever used or reproduced with the appropriate permission. The current approach to AI seems to ride roughshod over these conventions, and it is no surprise that those involved in the creation of AI tools are very keen to have regulation be after-the-fact, and applied only to the products of these tools.<br/><br/>It is my strong belief that AI must be regulated at the tool / model level, and that the ingestion of copyrighted materials into any system which is or might be used for commercial purposes should require the explicit permission of the copyright holder.<br/><br/>I do not believe that after-the-fact remuneration is sufficient (nor do I believe that there is any reasonable way of reckoning such compensation). I do believe that a tool which ingests and stores my own copyright work, for the purposes of creating commercial content which is designed to compete with my own, is a blatant violation of my own intellectual property. <br/><br/>I would hope that any tool which is used commercially should have to maintain records of permission for the use of all ingested material.<br/><br/>I would also hope that any work generated by an AI tool which has had access to copyright works ingested without permission, regardless of the degree of human input and prompting, should not be eligible for copyright or IP protections.
