Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration. Human creativity is central to civilization from art to science and technology, down to the basic everyday agency of solving the problems of daily life&#39;s narrative dilemmas.  As a proud Writers Guild of America member, I am writing to urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. <br/><br/>As storytellers, writers and image makers, we spend years creating stories and audiovisual media driven by our creative impulse that is a confluence of literacy, vision, the humanities and the sciences. Technology, at best, gives us the tools to materialize visions and stories into the audiovisual media that feeds the billions of large and small screens around the world.  Books, films, television series are the real estate that feeds the global media pipelines that entertain billions.   <br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence, at best, can help find breakthroughs in medicine, science that enable the betterment of our species.  At worst, AI is threatening to become a behemoth grinder of plagiarism disguised as legalized compositing of pre-existing works of creative, literal, visual and narrative media.  <br/><br/>I remember in my early years after graduating from USC Film School, registering my written stories and screenplays with the U.S. Copyright Office which, for a recent graduate, represented the government entity that was the legal protector of my created work.  I felt and continue to feel that the Copyright symbol has agency.  For me, you continue to represent one of the cornerstone institutions that is necessary to the health and longevity of a functioning democracy. <br/><br/>As a child of refugees that were denied the freedom to create or preserve the copyright of their created properties, I cannot overstate how essential your institution is to the future of creative rights and human copyright.  <br/><br/>I support technological and scientific advancement for the betterment of all humanity. That may be naive in this day and age as screens dominate every aspect of our lives and the human touch becomes a tiny bit more distant every day.  Regardless, we must fully protect and preserve our human faculties of creation, artistry and science, or else we risk losing the very core of what makes us human.  <br/><br/>In order for something to have &quot;Copyright,&quot; it must be created by human hands and minds, not by machines who know nothing of love, loss, displacement, survival, exile, family love and hope.  Technology must serve and enable, not supercede our humanity.  <br/><br/>In agreement with my WGA West and East union siblings, I echo wholeheartedly and support what we fought during our 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.  Both of our unions highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Eric Nazarian<br/>Los Angeles, CA
