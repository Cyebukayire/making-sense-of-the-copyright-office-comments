COMMENTARY FOR THE UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT OFFICE<br/><br/> (1) the use of copyrighted works to train AI models; <br/><br/> The word &quot;training&quot; is a misnomer.  Machine Learning (ML) systems encode copyrighted works into their corpus, in an analagous way that a digital camera encodes an image into a JPEG file.  The copyrighted work encoded into the ML&#39;s corpus becomes part of the process of creating every work produced by the ML system.  Ipso facto, every work generated by the ML system is a derivative work of every copyrighted work encoded into the corpus. Absent prior permission, every piece of work generated by ML is an infringing work of every copyrighted work encoded into the ML&#39;s corpus.<br/><br/> I think copyright holders should have the right and the expectation to protect their work from unauthorized infringement.  They should have a mechanism to exclude their work from being encoded and incorporated into the corpus of a ML system.  They should also have remedy from such infringement, including injunctive relief against the infringing work being distributed.<br/><br/> Authorization and licensing of copyrighted works to be encoded and used by ML systems to create new derivative works should only be allowed if executed in a special-purpose agreement.  Like assignment of copyright, authorization for incorporation into a ML system should not be buried in the middle pages of a long work-for-hire contract, or a multi-page agreement for licensing stock photographs.  The copyright holder should clearly understand that they are agreeing to incorporate their work into an ML system that might be used to compete with them using their own style of work.<br/><br/> There should be stringent punishments and remedies against companies who infringe on copyrights by incorporating them in ML systems.  Many of the companies in a position to violate the copyright holder&#39;s rights are giant corporations who are so wealthy that infringement fines are a slap on the wrist.  There should be injunctive relief, and some kind of permit system so that a company&#39;s ability to use their ML system can be revoked if they misbehave egregiously.<br/><br/> (2) the copyrightability of material generated using AI systems; <br/><br/> This is a difficult issue.  At the heart of it, we must at some point draw an arbitrary bright line to distinguish what is protectable and what is not.<br/><br/> I think it&#39;s unreasonable to say that any work from a generative ML system should be unprotectable.  Simply because a computer does the heavy lifting doesn&#39;t invalidate the human expression involved.  Some of the text prompts given to Midjourney are over 100 words, carefully crafted by a human to coax a particular kind of image out of the system.  Clearly this is human expression, realized by the machine following the artist&#39;s directions.  I see this as no different from using Photoshop to build an image.<br/><br/> Clearly, you should not award copyright to material that is generated without direct and detailed intervention from a human artist.  The standard for &quot;direct and detailed intervention&quot; needs to be set.  Perhaps the arbitrary standard should be six factors.  If an artist can demonstrate that they interevened on six parameters, the work qualifes for copyright protection.  Artistic intervention would include text prompts, parameter settings on controls, guide material and any other kind of input used to influence the final output.  (Who knows if someone will make a full-body motion input for chatGPT to make it write poetry based on dance moves.)<br/><br/>So-called AI generative systems have the potential to create entire industries, adding hundreds of thousands of jobs to the marketplace.  For companies like Disney to make use of them, they need to be allowed to protect their IP.  Restricting industry from using ML will only serve to put the USA behind the pack in these new ML developments.<br/><br/>(3) potential liability for infringing works generated using AI systems; <br/><br/> As mentioned above, I believe that every piece of work generated by an ML system infringes on all the copyrighted works incorporated into its corpus without authorization.<br/><br/> If a ML system creates a work that is perceptibly copying a copyrighted work, the creator of the offending work should be liable for copyright infringement.<br/><br/>(4) the treatment of generative AI outputs that imitate the identity or style of human artists.<br/><br/>Since style is not protectable under copyright, I don&#39;t think this should change in regards to ML.  Imitating the identity or using the identity as a command to the ML system might be actionable under confusion of trade.  I think this is outside the jurisdiction of the USCO.<br/><br/>
