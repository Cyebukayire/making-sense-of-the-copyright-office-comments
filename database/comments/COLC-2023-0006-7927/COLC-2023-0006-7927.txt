Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America and a #1 NYT bestselling novelist. My novels&mdash;weird, imperfect creations only possible because of my interpretation of my strange life&mdash;have been used to train AI, without my permission, without compensation. Somewhere out there, AI can spit out versions of Stiefvater. My labored metaphors. My sly dialog. My point of view on science and miracles. Odd. Odd times.<br/><br/>The temptation is to shout DO YOU SEE HOW THIS ISN&#39;T FAIR?<br/><br/>Of course it isn&#39;t unfair, but much of life isn&#39;t fair. AI isn&#39;t the first to knock off my works; I&#39;ve been doing this long enough that other writers have written versions of my works and published fanfictions with my characters&#39; names scrubbed off. If life were fair, those wouldn&#39;t exist, either, but they fall into a nebulous pool of legal gray area.<br/><br/>But AI, in my opinion, does not. Scrubbing the content of published works to create its own distilled version is legally no different than a schoolkid plagiarizing a paper by grabbing words and phrases from enough online sources to create something that the professor might not be able to catch. It just does it on a massive scale, looking over everybody&#39;s shoulders at everybody&#39;s papers. THAT&#39;S NOT FAIR. But more importantly, we&#39;ve already decided it&#39;s not allowed. <br/><br/>I know this seems like a thorny situation from the outside, but I urge you to distill it to its essential form and take action. Ask who is truly benefiting from this technology in this format. Are we really making work easier and content better through sophisticated madlibs filled in with other people&#39;s work? No, this is just the guy at the party who sounds very clever but is actually just repeating phrases he read online without synthesizing them.<br/><br/>That&#39;s just one of my labored metaphors. I made it up because I&#39;ve met that guy. Has AI?<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Maggie Stiefvater<br/>Mount Crawford, VA
