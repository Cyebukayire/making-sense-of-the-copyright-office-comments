Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a novelist (published as both Emily Jenkins and E. Lockhart).  I&#39;m also a member of the Writers Guild of America.  My novels (more than ten of them) were used to train Meta&#39;s AI, without my consent, per that research article in The Atlantic. <br/><br/>In some of those novels, I invented slang which was used throughout the book. In others, I invented animals that don&#39;t exist in the real world. I am known for my turns of phrase and for my unusual literary structures (novels in multiple universees, novels with footnotes, novels structured as lists).  All of these literary structures were used to train the AI.<br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. <br/><br/>Novelists like me retain our copyright.  But when I work as a film and TV writer, I am an employee and create works for hire. WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Emily Jenkins<br/>Brooklyn, NY
