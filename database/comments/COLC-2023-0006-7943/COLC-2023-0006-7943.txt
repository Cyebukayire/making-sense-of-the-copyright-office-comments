Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. <br/><br/>No house should be built with stolen bricks.<br/><br/>Writers need continued public policy solutions to protect their work, as the U.S. Copyright Office has done since its founding. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art or writing depend on vast sources of creative work, much of it under copyright. Creators should have input into how and whether their work is used both as input and as output. <br/><br/>Further, such AI-generated work should not necessarily be entitled to copyright protection without strong evidence of human creativity driving the creation of the work.<br/><br/>Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rights holders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Christopher Michel<br/>Birmingham, AL
