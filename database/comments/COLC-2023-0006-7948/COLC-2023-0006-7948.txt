As an author, it  is devastating to see years upon years of my and my peers&#39; hard work unlawfully stolen and used for profit by those with no right to it. Especially in this specific way, which will eventually and inevitably eliminate new writers&#39; ability to create work in a meaningful and financially sustainable way. Please act now to protect the working class of artists from this theft.
