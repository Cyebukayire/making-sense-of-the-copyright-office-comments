As a writer, artist, and actor, I think there should be a ban on commercial uses of completely AI-produced content. No AI background actors, book covers, tv scripts, etc. AI could be used as a tool so long as the majority of the work is done by a human creator, but it should not be allowed to wholesale replace a human creator. I make book covers, I do background work, I post writing and art online, and I do not consent to having my image, writing, or art used to train AI datasets. I&#39;ve taken what precautions I can in the digital age but the government should protect artists intellectual property from AI scrapers.
