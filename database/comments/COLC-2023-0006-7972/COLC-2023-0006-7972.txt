<br/>I am a digital artist. I have been operating since 2017. I hold the opinion that the current stance the copyright office has taken, that AI generated outputs with minimal human editing should not qualify for copyright protection, is the correct policy for the copyright office to continue to take. I also believe that training an AI model on a copyrighted image or collection of copyrighted images does not constitute an infringement of copyright. Not any more than an artist taking influence from copyrighted works to create a new piece of art would.<br/>I have been experimenting with Machine Learning tools, primarily Stable Diffusion and Google Bard. I intend to provide answers to some specific questions in the notice of Inquiry that I believe I can respond to.<br/>Question 1: How will AI affect creators?<br/>Some creators have  already begun using these tools. Other creators have very vocally dissuaded people against using AI in a manner I would compare to bullying.<br/>I have seen 3 specific webcomic artists have filed a class action lawsuit against AI companies OpenAI and StabilityAI for copyright infringement. The alleged infringement stems from how these companies trained their checkpoints using the Laion5b dataset. There are no federal laws against web scraping in the United States as long as the scraped data is publicly available and the scraping activity does not harm the website being scraped. These artists found their work within the dataset and attest that they did not give permission for this use of their work, though this is itself an unsettled matter as they voluntarily posted their work to hosting websites like Twitter and Deviantart. . These websites state in their Terms of Service that artists waive their exclusive copyrights to make transformative works based on their works by posting said works to these platforms. These artists could not provide specific examples of these AI programs replicating an exact copy of any of their specific works. Artists as a community are upset and underpaid, and that has lead to a lot of anger and resentment sent towards the new technology that I believe is undeserved.<br/>I believe that generative AI images can be useful as a starting place to conceptualize imagery for a new creation, or as a way to add detail and refine a sketch to match the vision of an artist. Or as a way to inject and iterate, try different creative decisions at random, to see what can make an effective or interesting piece of imagery.<br/>Question 6:  What kinds of copyright-protected training materials are used to train AI models, and how are those materials collected and curated?<br/><br/>I believe that Machine Learning tools such as Stable Diffusion and Chat GPT are not violating an author or artist&#39;s copyright when they are trained on an artist or author&#39;s work. This medium has a long and storied history of artists taking influence from previous creators, and it is well precedented that aspects of artwork such as poses, subjects, and styles are not the exclusive property of the artists who create works depicting them. It is in the interests of the copyright office to promote the creation of new art.<br/>Much of the training of existing AI models did use materials scraped from the publicly available internet to function as a reference. There are no federal laws against web scraping in the United States as long as the scraped data is publicly available and the scraping activity does not harm the website being scraped. <br/>Question 8 :  Under what circumstances would the unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train AI models constitute fair use?<br/><br/>Unauthorized use of copyrighted material to train an AI model in general should be considered fair use based on the final creative product, i.e., whether the use of the copyrighted material leads to the kind of creative output that copyright law is intended to foster.  See Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc.&cedil; 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992) (disassembly of protected object code was fair use because it was necessary to access unprotected ideas and functional concepts embodied in the code, use of material was intermediate, and the purpose of copying was to make independent creative expression possible, not simply to exploit another&rsquo;s creative efforts).<br/>In Google v. Oracle America, Google&rsquo;s fair use consisted of copying a small subset of &ldquo;task calling&rdquo; interface codes (while not copying the implementing codes themselves) to encourage programmers to create new products, thus promoting progress in technology.  In Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith, Warhol&rsquo;s imposition of his unique style on Goldsmith&rsquo;s photograph was not fair use, where both products were sold to magazines.  The purpose and use of copyrighted materials in training AI models should be evaluated based on whether the final product expands the boundaries of creative expression or technological progress, and does not simply take the place of the original in the marketplace.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>
