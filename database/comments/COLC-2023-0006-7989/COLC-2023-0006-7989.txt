Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America and I strongly urge the U.S. Copyright Office to deny copyright protections to AI material, forever and always.<br/><br/>AI models only work when copyrighted material is fed into the inputs. In most cases this happens without permission or even knowledge of the original copyright holder. The AI model remixes that stolen material, responding to prompts, and reformulates that as stolen material as original.<br/><br/>This is not an act of creativity, it is an act of theft. An act of theft cannot be copyrighted, full stop.<br/><br/>I have heard the argument that all creativity borrows from the past, and while that&#39;s true, there is something fundamental that happens when that past artistic tradition commingles in the human brain with a human set of experiences and emotions. What comes out the other end is the definition of creativity and invention. i.e. copyrighted material.<br/><br/>If a machine-generated output, which can only exist if copyrighted material has been fed into it, can qualify for copyright protection, it is not only putting entire industries at risk (as AI can generate material at an extreme fast rate) (because blatant theft is fast and easy!) but it would be radically redefining the concept of an original idea. <br/><br/>This should be far beyond the scope of the US Copyright office, or any government institution. <br/><br/>Protect the concept of creativity and human ingenuity. Do not award copyrights to material generated by machines, powered by stolen ideas.<br/><br/>In fact, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Michael Fontana<br/>Ladera Ranch, CA
