Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI - a marketing term in the first place, as it is not intelligent by any metric humans use for intelligence - works almost-exclusively through the theft of copyrighted material. Because AI cannot generate its own ideas and cannot actually write, what it does is suck up materials written by actual writers protected under copyright, and it spits out variations on that stolen material. It will never be able to do what the AI engineers say it will be able to do, and because of that, if AI is not tightly reigned in with policy, all it will do is crater the entertainment industry and cause immense economic disruptions. (I used to be a philosophy professor studying philosophy of mind, and I can give you the theoretical reasons it will never work, but I think it&#39;s obvious simply from current empirical data that it can only produce plagiarized doggerel. Also, I - and all of my other fellow professors - had a &quot;no tolerance&quot; policy for plagiarism. Plagiarism includes slightly rewriting other people&#39;s work. Why is this plagiarism allowed, where it wouldn&#39;t be allowed in even the most lackadaisical academic setting?) On one hand, we are protecting our own work, but on the other, we&#39;re also fighting to make sure that this badly-designed hoax doesn&#39;t destroy a significant sector of the economy.<br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Andrew Beckerman<br/>Los Angeles, CA
