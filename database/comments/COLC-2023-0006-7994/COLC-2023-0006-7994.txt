Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;ve been a member of the Writers Guild of America for over 25 years. I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. But we writers can&#39;t address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art are based on the theft of our creative work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experiences. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. Finding a fresh approach, an original concept - these are key to success and longevity in our business.  AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Antoinette Stella<br/>Tarzana, CA
