Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The guild gave me a pre-written missive to submit and I wholly agree with and endorse its content. But in the spirit of this plea to you, I&#39;ll generate my own thoughts here about our concerns, and about what we need help with from all of you. <br/><br/>Here&#39;s the thing that should be considered the most: what is the function of art, of writing, of human creativity for the species and the larger world? From the creator&#39;s point of view, it&#39;s an expressive function. From the audience&#39;s point of view, it&#39;s a cathartic function, first. It&#39;s an instigating/inspiring function second. Creativity is a human impulse. We have a fundamental need to deal with our subconscious, precisely because it IS sub-conscious! The complexity of what we feel, think, dream, imagine, especially when it occurs within our non-conscious mind must be brought out or it becomes a cancerous force deep inside us, often times. So, we instinctively create. Sometimes via mimetic processes (so, literal representation of the source-content). Sometimes through abstraction (so, non-linear expressive representation). What&#39;s most beautiful--and functionary!--about this first-order utility is: creativity and creative expression is a tool for humans to deal with themselves and their world, via DOING, via CREATING. It is the very action we take that facilitates the catharsis on the creator&#39;s end. We get it out of our system. Sometimes that&#39;s enough. And then, sometimes we even come to understand the obscure BY getting it out of our system. That&#39;s the added bonus. And all of this allows us to live as a member of a larger community that much better and with that much more wisdom and peace.<br/><br/>But here&#39;s the kicker: by simply acting on this impulse to better understand ourselves, we creators then provide catharsis for all who experience our creations. Many times many of them aren&#39;t capable of the level of creative expression we professionals display. In experiencing our work, they are provided a maximum cathartic experience of their own, one that might have been out of reach to them left to their own capabilities. Sometimes we are offering up a mirror-experience to help them see what they are that is problematic. Or what they are that is good and should be focused upon. And then sometimes we provide them experience of all that is completely foreign and unknown to them, until we expose it. And in this case, we are then expanding their perspective and their potential to live a more full life. And still one more phenomenon occurs and that is that, often times they are then inspired and instigated to try to be creative themselves, leading to a personal empowerment to exorcise their own subconscious and arrive in a more developed psychic space of their own power. <br/><br/>I drag you through this analysis for this reason: since creativity is a mandatory human impulse with a life-affirming, life-expanding, even life-saving function, for both the creator and the human counterparts who experience it, why on earth would we want to encourage or empower an artificial creative generator of any kind, nor an AI creative culture? Think about what we are doing to our children if we are letting them use AI to generate a first draft of something? They lose all connection to the very source of their own creativity, that place from which all creative material MUST be generated, from second-one in the process. Instead they will be raised to be &quot;rewriters&quot; and rewriters of really badly written (I&#39;ve seen the AI first drafts), uninspired drivel. And they will discover nothing about themselves or the world they live in, or the psychic mysteries of their inner lives. They&#39;ll simply be executors of process and in turn dim the lights of their humanity.<br/><br/>Do the right thing here. Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Daniel Pulick<br/>Westhampton Beach, NY
