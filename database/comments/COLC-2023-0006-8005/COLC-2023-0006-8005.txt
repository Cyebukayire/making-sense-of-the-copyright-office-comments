Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>As a member of the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright.<br/><br/>The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too.<br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs.<br/><br/>Film and television writers are employees. We predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work.<br/><br/>If AI is granted copyright over creative material, human beings will be irreparably damaged. Our livelihoods, our careers, and our very identities as artists will be at risk. We will be reduced to cogs in the machine, forced to compete with AI models that can produce creative content on demand.<br/><br/>I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to stand with creative workers and protect human creativity. Deny copyright protection to AI-generated art, and give writers and other creative workers a statutory right to consent to the use of their work to train AI models.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>I am writing this letter with a heavy heart, but I am also filled with passion and resolve. I am determined to fight for the rights of creative workers, and I am calling on you to join me.<br/><br/>AI is a powerful tool, but it is not a replacement for human creativity. We must not allow AI to steal our livelihoods and devalue our art.<br/><br/>Please stand with us and protect human creativity.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jonathon Gentry<br/>Las Vegas, NV
