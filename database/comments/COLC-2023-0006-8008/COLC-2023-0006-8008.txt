Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I support the Writers Guild of America.<br/><br/>I urge the copyright office to make several decisions beyond those the Guild asks.<br/><br/>First, find that AI is a tool, and that like a pencil, a paintbrush or an any other tool, it does not have rights. All AI generated art is free from copyright by the owners and creators of any AI tool.<br/><br/>Second, that users who write prompts for AI to generate art likewise are not the creators of said product. They too have no copyright on the product, but only upon such unique alterations they may make to it.<br/><br/>Third, that so long as the generated product is sufficiently different from any copyrighted source art or images as to be distinct and to not infringe on other rights of persons living or dead, or upon copyrighted work, or that is clearly protected work as commentary (under prior protected first amendment rights rulings), that the source art used for training likewise accrues no copyright, anymore than a human artist taking inspiration from prior works would. The distinguishment between &ldquo;use of&rdquo; art, and inspiration being the degree of similarity. When the art is clearly an extrapolation of copyrighted work it may infringe that work. This may be particularly egregious where the likeness in image, behavior, quirks or personality of known persons might serve as the core of AI generated work. <br/><br/>In general, AI generated art has and should have no copyright or trademark by anyone (natural or artificial under the law) or any thing. <br/><br/>I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art can ir may replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sam Thomas
