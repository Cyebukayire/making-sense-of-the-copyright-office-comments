Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a video game developer and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright.<br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of artists&#39; work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Peter Bartholow<br/>Los Angeles, CA
