Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am an independent artist and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. I lost my full time employment in December from a layoff due to AI &quot;art&quot;. I spent months working with Stable Diffusion and understanding the technology from the inside out, so I come from a place of full understand of AI models such as the LIAON datasets when I say that allowing companies to steal billions of pieces of copyrighted materials and resell it will be the end of copyright law as we know it and do sizable damage to the US economy. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Artists, designers, musicians, and writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to creatives of all kinds and the integrity of our creative lives and work.<br/><br/>Moreover, the ability to deepfake has already had widespread consequences politically and personally for millions. We are already seeing its consequences with current political events and with individuals who are targeted by bad actors. Legislation should be made to protect the people of this country from further harm.<br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Christina Cavadias<br/>Los Angeles, CA
