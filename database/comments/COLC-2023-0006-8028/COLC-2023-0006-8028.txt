Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a writer and proud member of the Writers Guild of America. I believe that using creative works like writing and other forms of art to train AI without the permission of the writer or artist should absolutely be considered an infringement of copyright. Such actions should be considered theft and plagiarism. Thus, art created by AI should NOT be entitled to copyright protection. If I steal a piece of jewelry, I am not entitled to compensation if it is then stolen from me. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Veronica Holcomb<br/>Los Angeles, CA
