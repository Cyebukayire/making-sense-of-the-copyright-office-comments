Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I think one possible solution is to &ldquo;federalize&rdquo; the right of publicity as applied to voice, image and likeness embodied in copyrighted audio and audiovisual works. The resulting copyright interest should be allocated to the individual whose voice and/or image are included in the underlying work (and not the &ldquo;employers for hire&rdquo;). Regulations can be promulgated to delineate which uses are &ldquo;derivative works&rdquo; of the original copyrights and which are &ldquo;AI infringements&rdquo; of the newly federalized right of publicity. This is a problem that cannot be effectively regulated through the application of disparate state right of publicity laws. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Daniel Johnson<br/>Sherman Oaks, CA
