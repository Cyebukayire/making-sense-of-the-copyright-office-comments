Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>What exactly is the point of IP and copyright protection if it can be stolen and regurgitated back out by an AI?  What would even be the purpose of the US Copyright Office if you fail to protect Americans from this?<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Elizabeth Neveu<br/>Brooklyn, NY
