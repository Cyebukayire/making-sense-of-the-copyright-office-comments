My name is Lisa Dupree and I am submitting this comment as an informed citizen, and as someone whose professional and academic lives are deeply affected by copyright and AI. I am a paralibrarian and communications graduate student at American University and have special interests in media literacy, cyberpsychology, and online radicalization. I am also currently completing a course titled &ldquo;Communication, Copyright, and Culture&rdquo; which is being taught by Professor Aram Sinnreich (a leading expert on Intellectual Property) and am expanding my knowledge of copyright law in the United States.<br/><br/>Per Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution (The Intellectual Property Clause) the purpose of copyrights and patents is &ldquo;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&hellip;&rdquo; Rather than incentivizing scientific and artistic advancement, copyright protections for work generated by AI will have disparate effects towards creators and marginalized groups unless future copyright law adequately accounts for how generative AI can be used maliciously. To expand on this matter specific to visual media (pictures, videos, illustrations, etc.) I answer several of the questions prompted by Docket No. 2023-6; COLC-2023-0006, including:<br/>(2) &ldquo;Does the increasing use or distribution of AI-generated material raise any unique issues for your sector or industry as compared to other copyright stakeholders?&rdquo;<br/>(28) &ldquo;Should the law require AI-generated material to be labeled or otherwise publicly identified as being generated by AI? If so, in what context should the requirement apply and how should it work?&rdquo;<br/>(6) &ldquo;What kinds of copyright-protected training materials are used to train AI models, and how are those materials collected and curated?&rdquo;; and (9) &ldquo;Should copyright owners have to affirmatively consent (opt in) to the use of their works for training materials, or should they be provided with the means to object (opt out)?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Reference links for further reading are included as footnotes throughout my attached comment.<br/>
