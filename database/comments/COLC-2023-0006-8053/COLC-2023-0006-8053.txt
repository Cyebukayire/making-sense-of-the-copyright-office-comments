Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am not a member of the Writers Guild of America; however I also would like to urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, and also visual artists like me however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work, evidenced by use of our body of work as foundation without which the models cannot be used. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers and visual artists work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees, as well as visual artists and graphic designers employed by companies not just in America but all over the world whose hands sculpted untold number images we see every day. We predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members and individual artists should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers as well as visual artists and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Hans Yuu
