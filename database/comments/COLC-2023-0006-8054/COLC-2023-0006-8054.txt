Until such time as we can ensure that AI tools aren&#39;t acquiring copyrighted and/or copyright-able materials, such AI-generated works should be marked as such. Watermarks would work well with images and video while introductory text would work for verbal creations. While policing such a policy would be challenging, it&#39;s better than leaving us guessing, while taking a tiny step towards protecting the original work of creators.
