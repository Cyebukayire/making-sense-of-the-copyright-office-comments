I am a fiction writer--and also a scientist; this allows me a unique understanding of the dangers posed by AI, having seen it firsthand in botched essay submissions from college students. But I&rsquo;m not writing about college campuses. I&rsquo;m writing about writing. AI is not only a danger to the livelihood of thousands of authors, but to innovation in general. AI as we call it is a fairly simple predictive model. It takes in information, makes inferences based on it, and splices that information into something &quot;new.&quot; New is in quotes here because it&#39;s not new at all. It is mimicry and regurgitation, and because it draws from what already exists by necessity, it cannot create anything truly unique, groundbreaking, or exciting. The United States has hosted some of the world&#39;s most famous authors. It can continue to do so, if those authors are protected. AI must be heavily regulated in the United States to prevent a stalling of artistic and cultural progress.
