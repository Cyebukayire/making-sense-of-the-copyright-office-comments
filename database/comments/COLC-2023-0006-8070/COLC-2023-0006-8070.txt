Steal from one person and its theft, steal from several people its a heist, steal from millions of people and its progress, thats seems to be the attitude thats spearheading A.I technologies. If i use someones work in my commercial enterprise i need to pay for the commercial rights to use that work/product/data, but a.i programs are seemingly ok to commercially use other peoples data without any compensation or even permission. The sheer lack of regulation or ethical implementation has already destroyed several industries (their just going through the stages of denial atm) and is poised to spread even further as A.I will be implemented to replace vast amounts of skilled people in almost every sector, AND THE REGULATORS ARE RESPONSIBLE. A.I is a shortsighted exploitation of the publics labour and skill, it will cause massive harm to the public in the name of aggrandising the small number of people who already have too much. Will you wait to enforce the commercial usage of our data until an unmanageable number of people become unemployed? all because the legislator was sleeping on the job whilst an industrial revolution ravaged  industry after industry. The after effects of the spinning jenny are there for all to see in the history books, represent the public and PREVENT this unprecedented level automation causing further destruction, or at the very least create a realistic timeline for Universal basic income, because that&#39;s the inevitable conclusion of letting A.I run its course.
