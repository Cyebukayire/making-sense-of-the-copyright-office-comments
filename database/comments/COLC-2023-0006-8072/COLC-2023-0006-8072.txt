While Tech companies may consider the use of copyrighted materials for &ldquo;learning purposes only,&rdquo; the stark reality is that they are teaching these LLMs how to effectively replicate human language and creativity, not to benefit and further support human beings, but to eradicate the need for human intervention. The idea that a computer can be programmed to &ldquo;spit out&rdquo; a book, screenplay, etc. is not to make life easier for us, it&rsquo;s to make life easier for them. They have effectively stolen materials from the very people they&rsquo;re seeking to replace to use it to replace them. I would respect the existence of AI in a creative process if they were capable of teaching these models how to work without the use of existing creative devices from the brilliant minds of human beings. The fact that these LLMs need to be fed our work in order to even have these capabilities tells you all you need to know about how artificial it actually is. They can liken it to a student learning in school and reading existing texts, but the reality is, I don&rsquo;t know any creatives who are ingesting texts and then taking them and effectively copying and pasting them as their own generative material. Human beings exist. We have thoughts and feelings and use our brains in such weird, beautiful, imaginative ways. If these models were being used merely to help support humans in these processes I could understand, but that is not the intent and anyone who deludes themselves into believing the contrary needs to wake up. The government and regulators need to think long and hard about the future ramifications of taking away a sense of purpose and worth from human beings. The potential destruction and death it could cause from people feeling useless in their own world. It is disturbing we even have to debate this. Please do everything in your power to regulate AI and its uses before it&rsquo;s too late.
