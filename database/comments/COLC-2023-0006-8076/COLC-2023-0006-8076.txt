It is morally wrong to allow AI technology to &quot;scrape&quot; the work of artists, writers and other creative professionals without their consent and not paying to use their work. This is STEALING. Shoplifters run the risk of jail time, why are these AI businesses allowed to get away with theft? We didn&#39;t think issues like this through and allowed the Internet to morph into an environment in which intellectual theft that robs creative professionals of their hard-earned income is already rampant. We need powerful regulations to stop this free market crime before it destroys too many livelihoods.
