Please do not allow major corporations, governments, or ANY citizen as an individual to be able to use the likeness of another citizen WITHOUT their consent, especially for profit. Every citizen should have the copyright to their own likeness at birth or at the moment they are granted citizenship. If someone else uses that likeness without the express permission of that likeness in writing or via contract defining the needed monetary compensation, they must be punished by federal law enforcement. Strongly. For instance, record companies should NOT grant a service like YouTube the ability for YouTube users to make and monetize AI-generated songs using the AI vocals of that record label&#39;s real-life recording artists WITHOUT the artist&#39;s permission. No current record contact likely covers this issue in any way that protects the artist&#39;s likeness. Taylor Swift will not stand for this, I think.
