AI is a tool that recontextualizes and remixes other ideas generated by all of humanity. This is the same process a writer uses to create &#39;original&#39; ideas. These writers are not expected to catalog all of the copyrighted material that inspired their work; why should art that uses an AI language model have to do more (as long as the material generated does not plagiarize a specific work)?
