AI takes creative content without permission, credit, or recompense and uses it to annihilate the creator&#39;s livelihood for the sole benefit of the thief. If AI is allowed to remain decriminalized it will result in the complete discrediting of the entire concept of intellectual property. I believe it should already be considered illegal using a good faith reading of existing copyright law. By so severely attacking the victim&#39;s livelihood it clearly fails to meet any standard for fair use.
