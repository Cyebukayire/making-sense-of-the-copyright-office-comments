Work generated by Artificial Intelligence should not be copyrightable and should not be produced using works that have not been authorized for that use by copyright holder. Generative AI programs should be entirely transparent about what works are included in their data sets so as to discourage use of works not authorized for that purpose. What generative AI produces is not truly transformative, but rather copied from the works in its dataset. Furthermore, the act of providing prompts is not enough to assign human authorship over what generative AI produces.
