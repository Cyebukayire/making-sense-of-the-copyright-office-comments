In my opinion using artificial intelligence to create work should not be eligible for copyright since most artificial intelligence is simply putting large amounts of existing work into a model and pulls out results based on human inputs.  The model does all the work and there is no/very little human input and a work needs human input to be eligible for a copyright.  If it is possible to use AI created works for copyright it will become incredibly easy to simply create large amounts of work and copyright them and sit on them and claim later human generated works are infringing on the copyright, similar to patent trolls.  Additionally, it does not feel that artificial intelligence is meaningfully transforming the works that are used in building its model, rather the artificial intelligence just takes large quantities of existing work and makes minor tweaks and then gives out an expected result that does not advance art, entertainments, or the human spirit in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments
