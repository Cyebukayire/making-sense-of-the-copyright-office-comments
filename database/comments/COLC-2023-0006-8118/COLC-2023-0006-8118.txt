Generative AI models are built on theft. Theft of the works of all kinds of creatives around the world. These models use data from copyrighted art, photos, voices, text and works without consent, credit or compensation. Without all this data, they would be nothing. And then, this is used to compete in the same market as the original authors of the works the models are trained on. This is exploitation. Giving these programs copyright protection would further increase this exploitation. This is not fair.
