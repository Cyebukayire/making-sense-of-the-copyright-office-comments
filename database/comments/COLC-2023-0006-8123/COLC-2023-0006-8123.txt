Distinguished Honorable<br/>We are a group of artists, creatives, publishers and associations from all over Europe united in bringing to the public attention how our data and intellectual properties are being exploited without our consent, on a scale never seen before. Such an unprecedented situation has led us to join our forces to reach out to the European Institutions and have our voices heard. At the time of writing, EGAIR speaks on behalf of over 100.000 artists from all creative fields in Europe.<br/><br/>We favorably learned that the Copyright Office has decided to reopen the debate on Artificial Intelligence and Copyright. <br/><br/>We believe that AI companies have been systematically violating copyright and privacy rights of artists and creatives worldwide. We also believe that the current copyright protections put in place are insufficient in protecting creatives and copyright holders. This is why we urge the Copyright Office to uphold the existing copyright laws and strengthen them. <br/>It is vital to stress the importance of assuring that the use of data and works of the copyright holder to train generative AIs is authorized in advance through explicit consent by the copyright holder. Moreover, it is essential to underline that in using others&rsquo; works by generative AIs, the European legislation and International treaties such as teh Berne Convention on copyright must be respected. Since the US has an exemplary role in laws and regulation, we urge you to stand with your allies.<br/><br/>The amount of damage this disruptive technology has done to the creative industry transcends borders, which is also why we, EGAIR, felt obligated to leave a comment regarding this topic. The attached file, AI Art and its Impact on Artists | Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, discussed the impact of Generative Ai on Artists further. <br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/>EGAIR<br/>
