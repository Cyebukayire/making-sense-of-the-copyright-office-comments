Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am a writer. Three of my nonfiction books were stolen, taken without my consent and used to train AI. I was never approached for my permission. I was not compensated or consulted. This is being done to replace writers like me. This is thievery and should never be tolerated. These companies did this without asking, so that it would be a moot point when we all found out, that the damage would be done, and we authors would be unable to organize and stop it. This is all very, very wrong. To now grant them copyrights on AI work that is fashioned after mine and the work of others would be the ultimate wrong. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Kathryn Casey<br/>Houston, TX
