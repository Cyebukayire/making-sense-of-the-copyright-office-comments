As a fiction writer, it concerns me that copyrighted works, including those published online, were used to train AI models without the consent of the authors. While I do not oppose AI tools, particularly in helping with routine or mundane tasks, the way in which many of these tools has been trained is unethical and immoral, and our copyright laws should be updated to reflect that. I am not an artist, but have also been concerned with the way art AI tools were trained using the same methods. Copyright law was put into place to help ensure that creators--writers, artists, musicians, filmmakers, etc.--are able to make an income off of the works they create. AI tools that have stolen these works and regurgitate them in clearly recognizable forms certainly threaten that ability. Without regulation, I fear corporations will use AI tools to replace human knowledge workers because AI is cheaper than actual labor, to the detriment of us all. <br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Kelly Thomas, Pittsburgh, PA
