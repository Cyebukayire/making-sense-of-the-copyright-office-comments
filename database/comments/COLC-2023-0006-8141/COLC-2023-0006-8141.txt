Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. And while high-profile actors are able to protect themselves through individual negotiation, the rank-and-members who make of the majority of the acting industry do not have the clout to advocate for themselves.<br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work, be it our written words, our faces, our unique speaking voices, or our carefully created character voices. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. Voice performers and puppeteers spend thousands of hours honing and perfecting character voices, making careful acting choices along the way. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. It is the same thing with voice performers and puppeteers who voice characters; we participate in the creation and execution of characters that we do not legally own, but our contributions to these characters is invaluable... and quite often taken for granted. AI technology as it is currently being implemented (primarily as a cost-cutting device) poses a profound threat to writers and actors, and the integrity of our creative lives and work.<br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Stephanie D&#39;Abruzzo<br/>New York, NY
