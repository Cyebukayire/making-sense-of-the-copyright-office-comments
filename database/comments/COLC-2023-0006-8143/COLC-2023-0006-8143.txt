I believe generative AI systems should be required to transparently show what training data they use and obtain the consent of the humans who initially wrote, drew, or otherwise created said data BEFORE incorporating it into the AI system&#39;s training set.<br/>I think ownership of AI generated content should be considered shared between the human prompter, the team that developed the AI, and the person(s) who made the content used as training data. Greatest weight should be given to the interests of those who made the training data, then the developers of the AI, and least consideration in ownership should be given to the human prompter.
