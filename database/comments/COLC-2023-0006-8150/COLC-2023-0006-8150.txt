I believe the way we handle AI now is going to make a big impact on future society and our current future. AI is now rapidly increasing and is becoming more common all over the world, but along with this AI can be used for the major spread of false information or is able to lead to fraud and face identification failures. Due to this, right now is the time to make changes we want to see with the use of AI, AI can be used for making labor easier, if want to see AI used positively we must figure out a way we can make this happen. AI also uses a lot of energy, we should make a change to be able to make AI use renewable energy rather then polluting the world with more greenhouse gases. Now is the time to make changes.
