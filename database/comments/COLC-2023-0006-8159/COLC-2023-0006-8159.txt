My name is Vishma Maharaj. I am a multimedia artist that have worked with Resin, Acrylics, Watercolor, Alcohol inks, Jewelry designs, Sculpting and more... Last year I started playing with AI and got really good at it. So good that the images that were produced from my prompt descriptions were stolen by companies in China and are currently being used to scam Americans and other people across the globe. Because these companies knew that I could not copyright my images they have stolen them. Some have used my images to create products to which I receive zero compensation for. There was a firbes article documenting this situation. This is not fair. Something has to change. We need some kind of copyright or this will continue to happen. I pay quite a bit of money each month to produce these images. I have inspired seasonal and non artist alike because of my images. I have had celebrities reaching out to me in hopes to buy my work because they believe that the dresses exist. I have attached some photo examples of the images I was able to produce in collaboration with the AI system Midjourney. <br/>I do not agree with the argument stating that all AI images are created soley by the machine. Because without the creative thoughts, words and guidance the AI would not create anything. There is a reason there are better and worse AI images. It&#39;s an acquired skill that needs to be taken seriously. AI is the future and you can be a part of making that dream a reality. Copyrighting AI artwork.  Just as the photographer had to wait so long to get his photos copyrighted. It&#39;s the same concept of using AI as a tool. The camera takes the photo. The photographer points and clicks after setting the parameters to guide the camera to get the best result. Then he/she photoshops the image to get the desired results. Please consider my plight and others, because we need copyright.
