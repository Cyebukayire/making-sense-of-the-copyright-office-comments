I believe that authors whose books were used to train AI should be compensated monetarily. I don&#39;t think authors should have to declare that they used AI to check grammar or assist them in plotting. That would be like disclosing you used a computer or a brainstorming partner. They should disclose it if the actual words are AI generated.
