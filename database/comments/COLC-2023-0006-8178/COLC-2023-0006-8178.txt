Intent to preserve author and inventor IP rights- All rights reserved.- for rest of 21st century as AI software model types and names evolve.<br/><br/>Upgrade Title 17 to include formal declaration sole authors have &#39;opt out&#39; rights declaring their work not to be used in AI model traing for ALL model types. Declaring All rights reserved against AI model training for Foundation Models and ALL other model types. Including, but not limited to ml training using software APIs of any kind. Copyright holder &#39;Opt out&#39; rights are for- ALL software and hardware model types- including future model types, existing and newly trained Foundation models, Gen AI models, TensorFlow models, PyTorch Models, biological based models, quantum based models, neuromorphic based models, cloud based models, analog electronic models, optical computing models, holographic models, audio models, and any other current or future API or modelling software, modeling hardware and frameworks capable of creating ANY type of model capable of regurgitating, displying, interogatoring textually, visually, haptically, holographically, by AR, by VR, including arc of story, character names, jokes, unpublished works, videos, images, designs, graphics, source code, audio contents music and any other copywritten published AND unpublished works. <br/>Additionally, USPTO patents such as registered design and utility patent summaries, claims and figures should be immune through opt out of being used as data in Machine Learning model training for ALL types of models.
