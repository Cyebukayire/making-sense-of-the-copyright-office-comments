Hello. Please put in federal-level protections for artists like myself from the impending threat of artificial intelligence. Right now these programs are scraping the internet and stealing pieces of original human-created art and generating pieces that are using stolen original art. Companies are profiting off of creatives who put their blood sweat and tears into their works. We need the US government to be a leader in regulating the use of AI before many more people are put out of work. Thank you for your time.
