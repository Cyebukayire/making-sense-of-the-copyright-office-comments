AI generated images through the use of Microsoft Bing and DallE-3 should NOT be prohibited from monetizing or profit. If it has been ruled by a U.S. court that AI generated images WITHOUT human involvement has no basis for copyright claim, then why is it that Microsoft can track images that are human-assisted, and flag us for infringement. Bing does not own these images as they are not created by AI alone. How is it that humans own the prompt but not the image?
