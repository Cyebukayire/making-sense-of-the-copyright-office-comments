Title 17 update, Software Applications, Image Editing Features, Photo Watermarking by sll new cameras and smartphones, <br/><br/>As part of existing Title 17, have smartphone manufacturers adhere to &#39;good faith policy&#39; and new law that smartphone manufactures and app developers include automated watermarking tools such as DeepMind&rsquo;s SynthID. To include specific watermarking, node-locked data or core-locked metadata in factory shipped smartphones, Operating System applications, TPUs and image modding apps. If not specific metadata, then auto generated file data supporting the ability for US Copyright Office and US law officials to easily determine: 1) Is this image or photo a Generative AI image? Is this image the product of multiple images?<br/>2) Is image a by-product of facial editing, facial photo replacement?<br/>3) Is image a by-product of filtering?<br/>4) Has image data been altered? If so, when and what?<br/>5) Has image data been moved, removed, replaced in image?<br/><br/>Problematic, emerging smartphone example, Google, Pixel 8 smartphone ships with photo app capable of editing multiple group photos&mdash; into a combined, single photo containing the best face expressions. A group of four people gather and a person uses a smartphone to take 10 photos of the group. In each photo, at least one person, has a look on their face that someone is not happy with. Google, Pixel 8 software feature combines the best face expressions from each photo into one final photo. (Also includes ability to move objects in photo to make photo more &lsquo;appealing&rsquo;.) While appealing to individual consumers, potentially creates a number of problems:<br/>1) Photo is no longer original, pure as the moment the photo was made. Photo is no longer a fully &rsquo;human-authored&rsquo; image and therefore copyright ability of the photo is in question.<br/>2) Potentially generates problems with forensics, enabling potential fraud as court related evidence of individual&rsquo;s actual facial expressions, locations of objects in a photo and other photo evidence.<br/>3) Degrades historical truth about individuals or a group emotional state on a particular day and time over decades and centuries.<br/>4) Encourages and enables, proliferation of generational Lie Culture- as everyone in a generation normalizes the idea that it is ok to create a composite photo (that never existed) wherein the photo everyone is happy- when it took ten photos and facial replacement to make the one happy group photo. <br/><br/>DeepMind has a working example of Watermarking called SynthID available in Google Cloud, section Vertex YnthID example of photowatermarking technique.<br/><br/>Maybe Deepmind can provide current tools to US Copyright Office for determining automatically if a photo is completely unedited and not a output of Gen AI applications.
