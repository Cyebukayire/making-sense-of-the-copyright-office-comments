Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a concept artist and a member of the IATSE USA Local 829 Union and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. <br/>The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI generative models in their current state are a danger to human creativity for Artists, Writers, Actors, Directors, Musicians, Designers and more. The key element to making these very powerful software models into tools, not human replacements is CONSENT. It&#39;s vital that internet scraping should be illegal when it&#39;s done on such a grand scale, for profit, and at the expense of hard working creatives. There should be an OPT IN option in AI databases not an OPT OUT as it currently stands. <br/>My work has been included in the databases as I found out. I was never asked or compensated. <br/>I should be asked if I want my work to be used to train models that could potentially replace me and my craft. There are already books and animations being published and aired using AI with no copyright regulation. These issues need to be addressed now, because the CEOs that are looking to cash in on this don&#39;t care about anyone&#39;s rights but their own. One argument that I keep hearing is that we all &quot;copy&quot; from one another and therefore it&#39;s ok for a AI model to do what we all do, that is called inspiration. But we are comparing a human to a machine. There&#39;s a huge difference. <br/>I don&#39;t think we can stop this advancement in technology that can absolutely be an incredible tool to do things faster. In order for that tool to be just that, a tool, it needs to be regulated. Artists whose work has been stolen without consent need to be compensated. The models for AI need to be redone so that only copyrighted work is included in their databases.<br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Michael Blank<br/>Stamford, CT
