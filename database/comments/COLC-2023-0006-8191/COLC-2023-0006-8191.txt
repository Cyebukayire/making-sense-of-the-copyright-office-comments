Hi, I&#39;m an illustrator and artist. As soon as I learned generative AI it&#39;s trained on images of the whole internet I was aware of the problems with privacy, unfairness and consent. I can not belive that this companies can get away with stealing data from all internet users without any punishment or consequence so they can train these AI models. I beg you, please to do something about it and to protect human copyright and privacy rights. There are a lot of issues surrounding AI generative nature like: misinformation, spam, unfair competitions, fake news, fraud, blackmailing, deep fakes of real people, plagiarism, reputational damage, economic loss and more. This paper academic paper talks about more of this in detail and it was made by qualified authors: AI Art and its Impact on Artists https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681<br/><br/>Please, do not give copyright rights to generations made by AI or should I say made by stealing. Reinforce consent by demanding the deletion of the datasets the AI trains on their current models so they can train ethically their datasets asking for opt-in training material, licensing and asking for consent. The absence of a &quot;no&quot; is not a &quot;yes&quot; in consent and should be like this in this context too. Also this consent and opt-in should not come in a updated &quot;terms of service&quot; on social media. That&#39;s abusing power. Social media has grown too much that we need it to keep contact with family and for job responsabilities. It&#39;s not ideal to be forced to accept our work/art/faces/voices being trained on this models if we want to keep in touch with family, friends or to keep our jobs. It&#39;s just abusing power and sneakingly giving away our rights.<br/><br/>Please work and reinforce the 3 C&#39;s and a T: Consent, Credit, Compensation and Transparency. These are the values that must be always present in this conversations. And there has not to be yet proper consent in any of these models, credit is nonexistent while generating something we don&#39;t know the source material, compensation is something giant companies want to work around by giving pennies for artwork that took months to made which is just not fair and transparency is also nonexistent in lots of this models that we just don&#39;t know what training data they&#39;re using. If these 4 values are not taking care of then there&#39;s no room for AI in the copyright law and should be punished as infragement of this same law.<br/><br/>I&#39;m hoping the voices of the victims by this stealing machine (also known as AI tech) are the priority, which practically means all of us that posted something on the internet. Humans rights and human work should be protected and the priority.
