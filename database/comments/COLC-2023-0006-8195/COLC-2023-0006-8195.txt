I am a US-based freelance artist. I graduated with a BFA in Illustration in 2017, and have worked as a freelance artist since 2018. Since generative AI gained popularity last year, artists have observed former employers using AI art for their conceptual and published material.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s my understanding that the generative AI datasets used by Midjourney, Dalle, and OpenAi were scraped from the internet from users of social media, artists&rsquo; portfolio websites, online publications, and other sources. Artists&rsquo; names are attached to the works collected, allowing AI users to prompt the software to create an image &ldquo;in the style of Hayao Miyazaki&rdquo; or any other working artist. Prompting software is not authorship and should not be protected by copyright.<br/><br/>AI prompters have shared their process publicly attempting to prove it takes &ldquo;a lot of work.&rdquo; They describe spending 1-4 hours tweaking phrases and naming a real person or studio&rsquo;s aesthetic in the prompt. They don&rsquo;t include or appear to consider any of the basic principles real art directors, editors, and artists consider when working, such as focal point, value, gestalt, and key. Artists know that in reality, finished artwork takes longer than a few hours, with years of study to back that up; it requires revisions, as well as knowledge of history, ethics, and good judgement in order to be publishable. AI generated art is always plagiarism, as it aims to replicate an aesthetic, while discarding the intention and incredibly personal and proprietary knowledge that an artist has gained over a lifetime to produce that aesthetic. Therefore, AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; publicly misrepresents the artists and historical art movements it was trained on. This harms individuals and devalues the industry and historical implications of art. It should be labeled as AI and not eligible for commercial use or copyright protection.<br/><br/>AI images are already being used commercially by the software&rsquo;s users. For example, Wizards of the Coast, publishers of the popular tabletop fantasy game Dungeons and Dragons, announced a ban on AI art in their new books after being lambasted for including such it on official material.<br/><br/>As another example, the opening title sequence in Marvel&rsquo;s TV series Secret Invasion was wholly generated using AI.<br/><br/>These are high-profile projects by major  companies with huge budgets. Previously, an artist would have paid their rent by doing those projects.<br/><br/>Using AI art as a cost-saving measure is greedy at best when most freelance artists already work for exploitatively low pay and few benefits. At worst, it&rsquo;s plagiarism. Midjourney, Dall-E, and OpenAI trained their models on our copywritten works without ever notifying us or asking for consent. Even the software we create with (i.e., Adobe Photoshop) and the platforms we share our work on for free (Twitter, DeviantArt) have covertly trained AI with our work. Artists now have the ability to opt out only after voicing our concerns. It&rsquo;s too little, too late. The AI datasets need to be scrapped and re-trained on public domain images, with the option for working artists to opt-in. <br/><br/>It&rsquo;s not only professional artists who are losing gigs with big publishers; regular citizens needing art for small projects now use AI where they previously would have hired someone. When I first started doing commission-based work, many of my clients were individuals needing profile pictures or portraits of their pets. These small projects were $75-150 in 2018-2020, and helped pay my rent and develop my professional skills. That market may not exist anymore with the development of generative AI.<br/><br/>The Lensa app is one example, as it profits by producing AI-generated artistic versions of peoples&rsquo; pictures based on working artists&rsquo; data and aesthetics. Users see it as harmless fun, while the company steals labor from artists and presumably scrapes their users&rsquo; data as well. We must require companies to pay for their datasets.<br/><br/>Further, AI images should be watermarked and not eligible for copyright. This benefits artists, designers, and photographers, but also the public, who are now regularly exposed to AI-generated propaganda on social media.<br/><br/>Artists are skilled laborers that produce all of the branding, illustration, and advertising people consume daily, and should be compensated fairly for the use of our work. The only problem generative AI software solves is the need to pay the people it stole labor from. Please limit AI generated images&rsquo; eligibility for copyright and commercial use, and require that all AI images are watermarked. Thank you
