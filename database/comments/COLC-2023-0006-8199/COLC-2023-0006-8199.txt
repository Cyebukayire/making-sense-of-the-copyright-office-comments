Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>As a longtime member of the Writers Guild of America, I am gravely concerned about the future of AI and its implications for copyright as a major element of the American economy.  <br/><br/>Our power as a nation is immeasurably enhanced by the creativity we manifest, and copyright protects that power and creativity.  The threats to that power from AI are beyond the capacity of individuals or individual fields of endeavor to address.  We urgently need public policy to protect the future.  <br/><br/>The WGA is correct to maintain that AI sustains itself through the theft of our work. AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work, and even more so, to the soft power of American ingenuity which inspires so many people to follow our lead.<br/><br/>Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Brian Nelson<br/>Woodland Hills, CA
