<br/>To whom it may concern,<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>For years, I have disciplined myself and practiced to hone my artistic skills. Especially now I prepare myself for a future where I can provide my creative lens to others. However, as Copyright laws regarding artificial intelligence remain unchecked, I watch this future fade in real-time. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Countless industry professionals have taken online to voice concerns over the dehumanizing nature of Artificial Intelligence. Once a helpful tool, artificial intelligence has been shaped into what I may describe as a blade meant to cut into practicing artists to bleed them dry. Just today, my professor had hung his head discussing a heated debate about AI. I find it disturbing how someone can rob me of my craft and of my job. I beg you to consider how Artificial Intelligence&#39;s training differs from pirating. I beg you to consider the toll our future would take without creatives to help guide it.<br/>Please keep this in mind,<br/><br/>Anonymous <br/><br/>
