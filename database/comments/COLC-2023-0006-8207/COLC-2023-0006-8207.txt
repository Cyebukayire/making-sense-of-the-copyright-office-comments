As a writer in all those years, seeing AI take our ideas (who is not easy to bring to life) and simply using them is pretty offensive to me, write is not pick a bunch of words and put them in a documents, it needs time, inspiration, dedication - is a job like any other, hard to do. Being a writer is already difficult, is only a few who succeed in this area, having to deal with an AI stealing our work is terrible, this makes us more understimated and less appreciated, not only this, but also destroys 80% of the purpose of the art - who is show our feelings, not only in the writing field, but also at the drawing, singing art, imagine work hard and the next day discover they took it from you without ur permission?<br/><br/>Not gonna lie, AI can be helpful in some ways, but it also needs a law to control, to also avoid ppl being too dependable on them, at least thats my opinion on the matter, as a translator, writer and begginer artist
