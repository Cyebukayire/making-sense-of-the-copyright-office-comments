On an international level I speak for every creator out there outside the USA, whether writer or an artist, that our livelihood cannot be jeopardised by USA&#39;s push to take advantage of any copyright-loopholes that would allow AI to steal our work. That cannot be allowed to happen. <br/>By the very definition of theft AI developers have stolen published artwork online for their AI plagiarism machines. It is already unethically gained property. Also on a very basic human level, if creativity, storytelling and capturing history, historical events and cultures are reduced to AI to &quot;tell&quot;, we won&#39;t have any signs of our - or any future - generations  left to record. When stories and art are not made by humans to tell stories that last - practically forever, future historians won&#39;t find any traces of us from &quot;art&quot; &amp; &quot;stories&quot; AI programs regurgitated. The very nature of humanity is at stake.<br/> If the content of the AI programs was obtained illegally, it should remain illegal. If the content was purchased from artist&#39;s and writers then it was done legally. Current status is that the content was obtained illegally. Copyright protection for Art and writing was violated, current AI programs use stolen property and you need to put a stop to illegal actives.
