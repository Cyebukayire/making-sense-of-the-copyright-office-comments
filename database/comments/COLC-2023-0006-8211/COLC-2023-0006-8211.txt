As an artist I feel like I don&#39;t have value anymore with AI, but I still know I will always do better than this fake &quot;art&quot;. I can see it good as a form of entertainment, but when it becomes more than that, then it&#39;s problematic. People who create AI are exploited, they take real art on the internet without any credit to the original creator to make their AI, and then bigger company make profit with it. In the end if there wasn&#39;t real artist, there wouldn&#39;t be any AI &quot;art&quot; since they can&#39;t do anything without a huge database. I feel sad to see my future being so uncertain now because of AI.
