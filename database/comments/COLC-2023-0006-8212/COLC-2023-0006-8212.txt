I am a physically disabled digital artist and beginner graphic/cháº©cter designer, suffering from a chronic illness that on occasions may cause me very high levels of pains. I rely on digital apps and softwares to make art more accessible for me as it is a huge passion of mine; however, I do not consent to my art being used for any artificial intelligence-related content, and more generally, am against AI generated content as they are now, seeing that most if not all are stealing content from non-consenting artists and creatives, and is rising doubts about whether some of us are human artists or simply people using AI generated images to pass them off as their own art.
