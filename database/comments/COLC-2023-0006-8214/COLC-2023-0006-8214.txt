My sibling is a physically disabled digital artist, who has had experience with art for about 7 years now, and is very passionate about creative works and expression through it by humans from across the entire world. They rely on digital apps and softwares to make art accessible to them, and offer coloured, fully rendered art that they would otherwise struggle a lot to make, if possible at all. I will mostly describe the experience from my experience as a sibling of an illustrator and graphic/character designer, which aligns with their own views on the topic as well.<br/><br/>1. While generative AI may benefit to many, creatives and non-creatives alike, as it is now, this technology is a serious issue for all artists. Most AI systems are using voice samples, artworks and more, from people who did not consent to such use of their works or their voice, and some who are even against the current AI systems, which means that AI programs and those behind them are, in most cases as of today still, infringing many creatives&#39; copyright. The benefits for a traditional or digital illustrator would be having a visual reference of their rough ideas generated by typing prompts, instead of having one to multiple drafts, which is more time consuming. However, as the current technology still struggles with many aspects, such as hands or detailed character designs, and more importantly, is perceived as immoral and disrespectful by many artists, they would rather stick to using 3D dolls, which have existed for many years already, and making drafts themselves.<br/><br/>2. For my sibling and their illustrator peers, AI-generated material as it is now is more of a threat to anything, due to copyright infringement but also because aome actual, human artists may be falsely called out as AI users; some examples we&#39;ve seen being artists with a rough, messy artstyle, those with a way of drawing or painting that is considered &quot;generic anime style,&quot; illustrations that imitate very well the textures of a 3D character in a video game or seem to be realistic photos, and sometimes even just about anyone.<br/><br/>Training:<br/>The replies below mostly apply to AI generated images, although some may extend to a larger set of generative AI technologies.<br/><br/>6. I unfortunately need to make more researches as to how the materials are collected and curated, but from discussing with my sibling and myself seeing other people talking about the topic, what I see the most is illustrations from small or big artists being stolen and fed to the machine, voice actresses and actors&#39; voices being used with no agreement from them beforehand.<br/><br/>8. Neither my sibling or myself believe that there is any circumstance under which the unauthorised use of copyrighted works would be fair use. Artists dedicate a great amount of their time to learn and grow as they tread the path of an artist. Using one&#39;s works without their consent is a copyright infringement, and artists already struggle enough even in today&#39;s society, they don&#39;t need this additional battle against AI and people who show support towards AI &quot;art,&quot; disregarding actual artists&#39; works in the process.<br/><br/>9.1. Whether for commercial use or not, it is ethically much more positive for artists, and respectful towards them to have to consent before any and all uses of their works in order to train AI models.<br/><br/>10. We do believe a license of some sort, or a written contract agreed on by both parties, would be best for all. It would serve as a proof that there was discussion between both parties, and that they could agree on what can or cannot be done with the artist&#39;s works and the AI model. If fake contracts are to be made, the artist should be able to call for justice for absence of discussion before using their works to train the AI model, and basically stealing their content to one another&#39;s profit, whether commercial or not.<br/><br/>Generative AI Outputs:<br/>The replies below mostly apply to AI generated images, although some may extend to a larger set of generative AI technologies.<br/><br/>Infringement:<br/><br/>22. AI-generated outputs can implicate rights of reproduction and/or derivative work under all circumstances where an AI model is trained using preexisting copyrighted works, rather than materials available for any to use.<br/><br/>25. If one&#39;s works are used without their prior consent and hence, is infringing their copyright, all developers involved should be primarily held liable. As for end users of the system, they may be primarily or secondarily liable, especially if they claim that the AI generated image belongs to them and is of their own making &mdash; although here, I believe that it is in part up to the artist from whom artworks were stolen, to say who they hold accountable, among who they know are tied to the specific AI system used and/or images generated by it, for art theft and copyright infringement, among others.
