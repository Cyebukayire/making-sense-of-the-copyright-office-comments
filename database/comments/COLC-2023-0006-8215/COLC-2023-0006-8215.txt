I am basically begging you to be as harsh on AI as possible when regulating it. I have spent sleepless nights drawing, I&#39;ve put my entire soul into it - do you realize how it feels to see the career path you&#39;ve always wanted crumble before your eyes? And for no good reason. There was no problem with art, as a society we didn&#39;t need to make art &quot;easier&quot;, the people who would want to learn it would put in the effort - like any other skill. Besides, why art? Why is that what robots are creating. Art is a beautiful representation of the human expression, it allows us to weave our emotions into tangible masterpieces that people can relate to all over the world. And we&#39;re just supposed to surrender all that to Ai? Why? Do the big tech companies need money that bad? They can focus on a different AI market. We need to make art more accessable? Spend more money on art programs in schools and other institutions. If we&#39;re going to be a world where a computer causes millions of artists to starve because it was &quot;easier&quot; for the masses, I don&#39;t want to live in that world
