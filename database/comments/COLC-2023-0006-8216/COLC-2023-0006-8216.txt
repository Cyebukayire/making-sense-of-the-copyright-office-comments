I am an artist. I&rsquo;ve worked both digitally and traditionally for years, and even after 11 years of dedicating myself to art, I still have trouble with getting my art to a point where I like it. I put hours of work into each digital piece, so to see a robot be able to recreate what took me years of trial and error in a few seconds is very disheartening. Even though as it stands ai &ldquo;art&rdquo; can be identified whenever seen for the most part, there are technologies now and will most certainly be technologies later on to improve that. It will become impossible to tell the work of ai from the work of an artist who puts their blood, sweat, and tears into a piece. It uses our art to learn in seconds how to do what took us years.
