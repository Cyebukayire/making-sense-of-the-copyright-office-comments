There should be strong regulations on the usage of AI considering that it works with databases that utilize art by other, human artists, without their prior permission, creating a mash of images that in many cases is used to replicate certain artstyles with the goal of replacing said artists. This hurts artists because it makes it extremely difficult to find jobs, it is copyright infringement, and there should also be a debate on whether AI can be copyrighted considering that it is work generated by a machine, and not a human.
