AI is not transformative nor is it creative because it inherently removes the human element from transformative work such as parody and homage. Transformative work has a lot of thought and intention, no matter how &ldquo;base&rdquo; it appears to be. Typing in prompts to a program that scrapes data not just from other data inputs but also from largely stolen copyrighted work used without permission absolves the prompt writer of any creativity or intention. The resulting work is not man-made, nor does it use any labor, physical or mental, creative or emotional. Copyrights should belong solely to those who put humanity into creation, otherwise what else could be copyrighted? Randomly generated numbers? The digital age does not mean removing humanity from creativity.
