1) What are your views on the potential benefits and risks of Generative AI systems? How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, and the public?<br/><br/>Generative AI has few benefits and those benefits are not for the artists it draws from, but from others who wish to easily make a quick dollar off of the work of people who did not consent to have their work placed into these data sets. It&#39;s made it harder for the public to buy authentic artwork at festivals, street fairs, and conventions. It&#39;s been harder for artists to get tables at conventions where art is the main focus because AI Generative Artworks can be produced at mass and quickly, causing tables to fill up before the small independent artist, who, could previously table at a convention the years prior, to lose out on income. It&#39;s also become harder to find the original artist on portfolio sites, as the users who post generative AI often will use a specific artist&#39;s name or style to draw attention away from the artist&#39;s actual works. <br/><br/>2) Does the increasing use or distribution of AI-generated material raise any unique issues for your sector or industry as compared to other copyright stakeholders? <br/><br/>While artists are often aware that their work will inevitably become the property of whatever large company they work under, it&#39;s these same artists that now must compete alongside bastardizations of their own work to even be considered to be hired at these places again. It&#39;s unfair to artists to have to compete with an alternative that, while it may be quicker, is entirely reliant on artist&#39;s prior works.<br/><br/>6) What kinds of copyright-protected training materials are used to train AI models, and how are those materials collected and curated? <br/><br/>Any official piece of art that has been posted online by either the company or individual that artwork belongs to, has been used to train AI models. The materials are collected via data scraping and are organized by artist and company. <br/><br/>6.1) How or where do developers of AI models acquire the materials or datasets that their models are trained on?  <br/><br/>Often the materials are acquired via artist portfolio sites, ex. Artstation, DeviantArt, etc, or via Data scraping off of google&#39;s image browsing system. <br/><br/>6.2) To what extent are copyrighted works licensed from copyright owners for use as training materials?<br/><br/>To the extent of being sold online, in conventions, and in brick and mortar stores.<br/><br/>7.1) How are training materials used and/or reproduced when training an AI model? Please include your understanding of the nature and duration of any reproduction of works that occur during the training process, and your views on the extent to which these activities implicate the exclusive rights of copyright owners.<br/><br/>Often times the material produced is a 1:1 reproduction of the original artist&#39;s piece, with other artist&#39;s work implanted over it. This infringes on the original copyright owner as the works used are not the original works of the generative AI system nor the user that has set up the data set. <br/><br/>8.3)  The use of copyrighted materials in a training dataset or to train generative AI models may be done for &ldquo;noncommercial or research&rdquo; purposes. If AI models/datasets are later adapted for use of a commercial nature, does this still count as fair use? Does it make a difference if funding for these &ldquo;noncommercial or research&rdquo; uses is provided by for-profit developers of AI systems?<br/><br/>If I were to hold a food drive under the guise of donating the food to a local food bank, and encouraged local farmers who rely on selling their food to donate it, and then changed my mind to instead sell the food to profit myself, food I had not grown nor received in a proper business transaction, would I not get in trouble with the law? It&#39;s the same here. Training artwork on artists for research and noncommercial use, only to go and use that data set for personal profit is wrong as the matter of which the materials gained for use, was gained under a lie.<br/><br/>9) Should copyright owners have to affirmatively consent or &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; to the use of their works in training materials, or is it enough to be provided the means to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of training?<br/><br/>There should be an &quot;opt in&quot; function rather than an &quot;opt out&quot; as it&#39;s easy for AI developers to not advertise a copyright owner&#39;s work as part of the data set, when it is in fact in there. <br/><br/>9.5) In cases where the human creator does not own the copyright&mdash; i.e. they have transferred rights or the work was made for hire&mdash;should they have a right to object to an AI model being trained on their work? <br/><br/>Yes, they should have the right to object. In the case of the work being made for hire, it gives the hiring body the ability to force the creator to compete with themselves in future collaborations. <br/>
