I am an artist who has been practicing for well over a decade of my life. I was hopeful to enter the industry this year, however I have been barred from doing so due to the invention of artificially made inages. These AI models take thousands of art samples from artists that have not been asked if they could be used in their datasets and compile them in an organizational algorithm to generate things that resemble human made art. Due to this process taking a few minutes at most and creating images that seem presentable hundreds of artists, young and old, new and veteran, unknown and popular, are unable to find work. I have seen artists so undeniably skilled that it &#39;s painful beg for people to buy their art because they were fired due to this AI being capable of creating something serviceable in less time.<br/><br/>Many people don&#39;t seem to see the problem in this. We are losing our jobs, our incomes, our livelihoods, our passions, our hobbies to an unfeeling machine that is physically incapable of understanding what it is doing. People have been going so far as to claim that genuine artists&#39; work are AI generated now, sinking us all deeper into a pit of despair that many cannot recover from.<br/><br/>I, myself, have had multiple run ins with the people that use it. Trying to pass it off as art they made, trying to antagonize others by saying such cruel sentences as &quot;You made that in 8 hours? Well I made these images in 2 minutes!&quot;, and even going so far as to threaten artists and try to put them down so they become complacent. This is no longer just &quot;A few dudes creating images&quot; this is officially an outright war against creatives of all walks and languages.<br/><br/>I&#39;m not fluent in legal languages, I&#39;m hardly able to comprehend what could possibly be done here, but I do know there is a problem and we need something - ANYTHING - to fix it. Thank you for your time. And please help us.
