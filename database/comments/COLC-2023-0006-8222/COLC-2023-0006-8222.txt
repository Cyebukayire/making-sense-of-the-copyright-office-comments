I believe that AI works should not be able to be copyrighted by those generating those works unless they are meaningfully transformed in some way after the AI generated that work. I also believe that all AI works should be credited to the creators of the AI if the dataset is private or works that are not public domain, but if the dataset used to train the AI is public domain, like datascraped from Google, Social Media, and other things that can be openly searched and found without being copyrighted material prior, it should be credited as public domain and not copyrightable at all so that others can&#39;t simply sell material that isn&#39;t their or that is public domain.
