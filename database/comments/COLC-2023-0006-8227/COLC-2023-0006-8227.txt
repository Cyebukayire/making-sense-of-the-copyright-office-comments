Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America as well as a professional novelist, and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to protect human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. <br/><br/>&#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39; whose functionality is predicated on ingesting copyrighted material (or material that has been illegally reproduced and posted online) without the express consent of the owner of that copyright is no different from theft of that creator&#39;s work, and it would be a profound injustice to extend copyright protection to the derivative works created by the sort of &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; proliferating in chatbots like those created by tech companies such as OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, et al. These algorithmic regurgitations would not exist without stolen intellectual property. <br/><br/>If we allow such derivative works the protection of copyright, we are undercutting the economic benefit that facilitates our society&#39;s art, culture, science, and all acts of human invention. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Justin Weinberger<br/>Brooklyn, NY
