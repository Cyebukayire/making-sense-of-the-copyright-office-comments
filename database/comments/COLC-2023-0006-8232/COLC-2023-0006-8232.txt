I am an independent illustration artist, and I am concerned with the unrightful and unconsensual usage of my and other&#39;s copyrighted work and material in AI generation models; to emulate my and other artist&#39;s work, and to take commercial place in our industry built off of our work without any compensation or consent from the original creators of the data they are using, nor the skills we have spent our time fostering to be capable of what we do. They should not have the right to make money off of our work without our consent nor compensating us. Even if they are not using AI generation commercially, they should not be able to use our work without consent for their training datasets, as it unethically disregards the personal attachments we as creators may have to our copyright works. I have spent over a decade of study and practice to do what i do as an illustrator, and even if I hadn&#39;t a briefly written prompt generating something from a database using my scraped work does not compare to the human work or heart put in by a creator to manually make their own creations.<br/><br/>I believe AI generated material should not be protected by copyright if it is made from datasets built from data from public social media and platforms or commercial products (film, television, music, software, audio, illustration, photography, etc) without consent received from direct personal contact to the original copyright owner(s) of the data submitted to the training dataset. <br/><br/>Many creators use social media platforms to establish their careers and now are forced to rely on them to keep their stability and their place in our economy. With this said, social media platforms themselves should not be able to abuse their power over their users and should not be able to force their users to consent to their copyrighted data being used for AI generation to produce material, nor consent of their data being used being &#39;opted in&#39; by default as many have been attempting to do, with &#39;opting out&#39; of their data being used being forced as the manual and often obscured option. Affirmative &#39;opt in&#39; consent is essential for both ethics and the stability of the people working in our industries and economy.<br/><br/>Circumstances in which AI generated material could be protected by copyright is if the data submitted to the training dataset has the explicit direct permission of the creator(s) the data. Environments such as studios having their artists manually build material for a database to help the workflow of their production may be permissible to make a copyrighted final product, such as the animators of &#39;Spider-man: Into The Spiderverse&#39; having their animators develop an AI generation tool through their own drawings to help with applying linework in their final 3d animated film rather than manually drawing on every frame. In this studio setting, the creators of the data have gone in knowing explicitly what the work they have made is being put into, what it&#39;s purpose is for, and is part of the work they are being paid and thus compensated for. This is an acceptable use of AI generation that still required their own hard work put in the database to produce results.<br/>Ideally, their permission for the use of their work in these generation models in studio work should also be outlined and agreed upon in their employment contract or job description upon employment, a feasible means of acquiring consent as it would simply be another piece of terms and conditions in their written employment forms or contract. What their material while working for their employer will be used to train should also be outlined in writing in these forms, so they may protect themselves if their work is used outside these outlines.<br/><br/>When not in a studio/workplace environment, if copyrighted material is to be used to train a generative model consensually, licenses should be acquired and agreed upon through direct contact to the copyright owner(s), including a contract and/or signature, or if the owner of the copyrighted material sells licenses to their material that includes explicit written permission for their purchased licensed material for use in training their generative model.<br/><br/>The emulation of creators work&#39;s and people&#39;s likenesses after their passing through AI generation is unethical, and should be considered as violation of copyright unless the correct legal guardians of the deceased&#39;s work and/or likeness have been contacted and their consent given for use in the training dataset, such as their family or estate.
