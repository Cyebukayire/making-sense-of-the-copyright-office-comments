Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>Thank you for opening this discussion up to the public. When it comes to generative A.I., it seems the U.S. Copyright Office has a chance to set the tone for the country, the world, and the future.<br/><br/>In my opinion, to rule that material solely generated by A.I. cannot be copyrighted is a start, but nowhere near enough to limit its potential damage. It is my sincere hope you will codify into law that all A.I. generated material is plagiarism, piracy, theft, and thus copyright infringement. Not only do I believe this will protect our children from intellectual deficiencies, but it is the right way to protect intellectual property.<br/><br/>Machines can replicate and generate, but only humans can create. Alphabets, vocabulary, and grammar have parameters. Human creativity does not. Our subjectivity makes it infinite. No two brains and bodies have ever been identical. We interpret the world differently. Our ideas are distinct. Our feelings are unique. Language is the tool we use to share our individual interpretations, ideas, and feelings. Whether or not one chooses to make a living as a writer, we are all writers and our work is copyrightable because it is creative.<br/><br/>If machines could replicate creativity, then one could argue that what it generates is... creative. However, it is impossible to build a machine that replicates something we do not fully understand. Machines can replicate stone, movement, and generate water and fire because we understand their physical properties down to the quark. Until we have a physiological understanding of consciousness, discover the derivation of thoughts, quantify the physical space ideas, memories, and emotions take up, we cannot replicate them. Therefore, a machine cannot even pretend to create anything.<br/><br/>At first glance it might seem like A.I. generates the way a human creates. But, it does not. I offer a humble opinion on the core distinction. Intention. We don&#39;t need to know what creativity is to know that it requires intention. Many of our fellow organisms in the animal kingdom are creative. While none have the same capabilities as humans, intent as a prerequisite is a law of nature.<br/><br/>Large language models and image programs use the history of writing and art to generate statistical inferences. Guesses without intention. Humans draw inspiration from pre-existing works, but do not rely on them. They are a tiny percentage of what goes into creating something novel. A.I. relies on pre-existing works, exclusively. <br/><br/>If there was a software program that took the 26 letters of the English alphabet, the 170,000 English words, the English rules of grammar and generated text without scraping the internet, or requiring a human prompt, we might be having a different conversation. Humans create stories the moment our brains allow us. Long before we can read, write, or draw. And we do it with intent.<br/><br/>Learning how to create is imperative. If generative A.I. flourishes in schools and in the professional world, it will diminish the necessary challenge required to push our intellects. It is possible that many forms of Artificial Intelligence will progress humanity in fantastic ways we have yet to imagine. This plea for the U.S. Copyright Office to deem all A.I. generated material as copyright infringement is meant solely for generative models. The programs that rely on the creative work of humans to generate the facade of creative writing and art. A machine is not now, nor can it ever be a writer. Every human that has ever lived is a writer.<br/><br/>Thank you, again.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Spencer Mondshein<br/>NY
