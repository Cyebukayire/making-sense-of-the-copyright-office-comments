I am writing to express my concerns about the presence of Artificial Intelligence in artistic disciplines, such as visual art, writing, and photography. Over the past year, online, free-to-access programs such as ChatGPT (used to generate writing according to user prompts) and Stable Diffusion (used to generate images) have cornered many artists and writers, leading them to wonder if a future in the arts is feasible now that AI-generated art and writing have infiltrated these spaces.<br/><br/>Software like Grammarly and WordTune have proven that AI may streamline certain tasks or professions. In the 2023 film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, for example, the VFX team developed their own machine-learning, or AI, tool to stylize the movie&#39;s line art according to the work put forth by the team (see Appendix 1). However, unlike this film, and the writing tools mentioned above, the intelligence of free-to-access generative AI software hinges on works by artists and writers that never consented to their inclusion in its training. American Scientist broke down the training process, stating that this software must analyze thousands of works to create a product (see Appendix 2). In the case of Stable Diffusion, and digital artists like Greg Rutkowski, this software often sources from portfolio websites like ArtStation (see Appendix 3). This is evident copyright infringement, with potential to erode the reputations and incomes of artists in the United States and globally. Attached to Appendix 4, please find a research paper conducted at the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society highlighting AI art&#39;s impact on working artists. <br/><br/>Academic institutions, publications, and working artists nationwide have begun to implement clauses in their submission guidelines, plagiarism policies, and commission agreements against the use of AI in submitted work, or the use of a commissioned work to train AI, thus indicating a need for federal regulation. Otherwise, the unchecked coexistence between human-made and AI-generated works will continue to breach one&#39;s trust in the art world and their own perceptions. This will require the mandatory labelling and/or disclosure of AI-generated work, especially when that work is released on a public scale, and for both software developers and users to be held accountable when copyright infringement has taken place. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and punctuality on the matter.<br/><br/>Appendix 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7OpYJFQXms<br/>Appendix 2. https://www.americanscientist.org/article/ai-is-blurring-the-definition-of-artist<br/>Appendix 3. https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/<br/>Appendix 4. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681
