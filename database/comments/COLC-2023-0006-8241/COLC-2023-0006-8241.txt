Artificial Intelligence isn&rsquo;t even intelligent, it&rsquo;s not a sentient being. There is no argument that it is an individual human being creating works, it&rsquo;s completely trained on others&rsquo; stolen works, imagery, audio, video, etc. There is no compensation for this training and there is no true concise way for anyone to opt out. Any and all input is stolen. Thus the result is stolen. Artificial Intelligence is merely a vessel for grifters to steal knowledge, experience, voices, and appearances, to make profit without anyone&rsquo;s consent and to effectively displace them. It&rsquo;s vile. The only laws around Artificial Intelligence that should be made are ones to prevent the accessibility of technology that steals money, lives, livelihoods, and the lived experiences we all have. No one should be able to make profit off of those without the express, concise, and direct consent of an individual. There should be no opt out option because it should be opt in to begin with. And if we don&rsquo;t limit the displacement of people as a direct result of A.I. abuse then more lives will be stolen as a result.
