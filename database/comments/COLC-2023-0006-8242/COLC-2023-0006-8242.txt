Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>Hello. <br/><br/>I&#39;m a WGA West member. I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. <br/><br/>The recently concluded WGA strike highlights the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers can&#39;t address all this by collective bargaining alone. We need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Iden Baghdadchi<br/>Los Angeles, CA
