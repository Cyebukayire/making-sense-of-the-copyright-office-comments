I&#39;m a digital artist, I draw for living, and I&#39;ve spent half of my lifetime learning to draw better, It was never easy and it&#39;ll never be easy.<br/><br/>But seeing AI generative artwork disrupts the community of art, It makes me fear of the future of art for everyone, I&#39;ve seen articles of AI generated artwork being put in competitions ended up winning :<br/>https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/ai-art-fair-winner-controversy/index.html<br/>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-my-ai-image-won-a-major-photography-competition/<br/><br/>These shows how grim to the future of Arts in general, knowing that generated content will flood the internet if we don&#39;t do something about it.<br/><br/>The main problem with AI generated content is how unfair it is, knowing that the generated content came from years of tears and blood of struggling, passionate, honest artists artwork, being put into their learning machine without their consent nor any kind of warning. All those hard work from victim artists are stolen and will never be compensated by companies that trains their AI with their artworks. AI trained trough unfairness, unlike Artists that spent their entire life learning trough pain and hardship.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve seen multiple account on X (formerly known as Twitter) posting AI artworks, that has traces of my favorite artists artworks, and earned money from it (trough subscription site like Patreon). Seeing those being made without the artists consent, pains me as an Artist.<br/><br/>AI is not alive, its only mimicking human&#39;s trait, be it Art, Music, Writing, Conversations, Feeling, it&#39;ll never be alive, After all, what is AI intelligence without human input? It feeds from the fruits of discipline, honesty, and hard work from undeserving victims. For that reason... AI generated content should not be able to be copyrighted.<br/><br/>Its basically plagiarism, without consents from artist, without compensations, without regards. It will impact all of us as an artist, and the people who enjoy arts in general. Artist will not be able to compete with AI generated contents, since it can produce infinite amount in seconds whereas artist has to take their time.<br/><br/>I urge the Office wouldn&#39;t not ignore this issue and thank you for your time reading my comment on this topic.
