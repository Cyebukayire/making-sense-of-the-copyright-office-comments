As a music producer and educator, I appreciate the Copyright Office&#39;s Notice of Inquiry on generative artificial intelligence and copyright. I encourage you to incorporate the perspective of artists, songwriters, producers and other creative individuals. The work you are undertaking will influence generations of creators, and safeguarding human creativity should be an essential component of future regulations.<br/> <br/>Generative AI is an exciting technology that has already expanded the universe of who can create music, eliminating traditional barriers to entry and making creativity more accessible. As a tool and instrument, it can unlock unprecedented potential, and push the known limits of music making. But generative AI should not be left unchecked to displace or eliminate human creativity. The Copyright Office must protect human creators. <br/> <br/>As you look to develop new rules and regulations governing generative AI, I urge you to crackdown against the widespread misuse and theft of copyrighted works to train AI models and systems. Music makers, particularly independent creators, are powerless to prevent their copyrighted creations from being ingested without consent or compensation.   <br/> <br/>I also urge you to reinforce the existing standards of copyright law that were designed to incentivize creativity and help ensure that outputs from generative AI models do not infringe on existing copyrighted materials. People should not have to compete against technologies that infringe on their work and displace them from the market. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to listen to those most impacted by generative AI.
