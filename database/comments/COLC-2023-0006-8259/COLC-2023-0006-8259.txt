I am a songwriter, recording engineer, music producer, and music business professor teaching these skills to the next generation of students. <br/><br/>Generative AI is a valuable technology that has great potential for advancing music creation in many ways. What is absolutely vital, is that a clear line of distinction and protection be maintained by the copyright office that continues to recognize works of personal, human authorship as the standard for copyright protection. <br/><br/>I also hope that the copyright code will be update to recognize a new realm that this new technology creates, which is the ability to sample an individual&#39;s unique voice or instrumental performance quality that is unique to a musician, then apply it in a new work. I believe the way forward is to protect individual performances by requiring a license to be secured similar to the mechanical license currently required for derivative works. <br/><br/>I am also concerned about the unlicensed use of copyrighted works to train AI models and systems. This is an area of protection that will require intentional application of law as well as new technology to confront. I support whatever funding is necessary to do this. <br/><br/>Thank you for allowing professional music creators to speak into this issue. <br/><br/>Sincere Regards, <br/><br/>Kevin Auman
