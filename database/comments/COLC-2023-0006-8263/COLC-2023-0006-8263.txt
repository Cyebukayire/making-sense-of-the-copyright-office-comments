If all computing is math, art AIs are taking colors, values, shapes and pixels from copyright works as numbers, averaging them out, and spitting them out as numbers again. It cannot be comparable to what a human being does with art. There is no meaning, there is no context. This is not romantic pining, it is a simple fact and an extremely important distinction. It&#39;s why an AI image filter struggles to determine the difference between a naked human body and a sand dune.<br/><br/>People have said that AI art programs learn and produce in fundamentally the same way as humans do. But an AI can never produce something more than what it is fed. The images they make can more and more imitate the massive amount of data that they are shown, far more than a normal person would ever encounter in their lifetime, and yet they will still never add anything truly new. If all human art is absolutely derivative, why are we not all still making cave paintings?<br/><br/>I believe the purpose of copyright law is to protect all individual parties&#39; right to profit from their creative works. AI algorithms that produce artwork undermine that, and are not intelligent; they are simply computational tools that have been fed enough data to output within parameters. They are not creative. They cannibalize math equations from art, as well as the jobs of the artists from whom their data has been taken without consent. I also believe that if AI art is allowed to proliferate commercially, then pushing more and more artists out of being able to produce, as some or many won&#39;t be able to continue pursuing it as a career option, will eventually stagnate all art as a whole because people do draw inspiration from each other, and AIs would theoretically have less and less new art to take. It literally just makes the world worse, and for what? The profits of a few tech entrepreneurs who used existing technology to undermine an industry?
