As a publicly recognized lifelong music maker, I appreciate the Copyright Office&#39;s Notice of Inquiry on generative artificial intelligence and copyright, and I urge the office to incorporate the perspective of artists, songwriters, producers and other individual creative workers. The work you are undertaking will influence generations of creators, and safeguarding human creativity must remain the foundation of any future rule or regulation. Music has been a fundamental aspect of personal and group expression and identity from before the beginning of recorded history. Sharing it from human to human with proper attribution is a fundamental component of human existence.<br/> <br/>Generative AI is an exciting technology that has already expanded the universe of who can create music, eliminating traditional barriers to entry and making creativity more accessible. As a tool and instrument, it can unlock unprecedented potential, and push the known limits of music making. But generative AI should not be left unchecked to displace or eliminate human creativity. The Copyright Office must protect human creators. <br/> <br/>As you look to develop new rules and regulations governing generative AI, I urge you to crackdown against the widespread misuse and theft of copyrighted works to train AI models and systems. Music makers, particularly independent creators, are powerless to prevent their copyrighted creations from being ingested without consent or compensation. In the rest of the world, there is a time tested word to describe this kind of imitative theft and reproduction. That word is &quot;Counterfeit&quot;.   <br/> <br/>I also urge you to reinforce the principles of copyright law that are designed to incentivize human creativity and help ensure that outputs from generative AI models do not infringe on existing copyrighted materials. No human should have to compete against a technology infringing their own work to displace them from the market. <br/><br/>This is about more than economic theft, it is about the cultural integrity of all human beings and the joy and quality of life that blossoms from human creativity and communication with other human beings.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to listen to the creators and working professionals most impacted by generative AI.
