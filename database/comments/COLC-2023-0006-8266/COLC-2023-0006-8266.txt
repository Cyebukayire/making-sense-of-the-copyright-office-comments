As a music maker for almost 50 years, I appreciate the Copyright Office&#39;s Notice of Inquiry on generative artificial intelligence and copyright, and I urge the office to incorporate the perspective of artists, songwriters, producers, audio engineers and other individual creative workers. The work you are undertaking will influence generations of creators, and safeguarding human creativity must remain the foundation of any future rule or regulation. <br/> <br/>Over the course of my career, I have used bleeding edge technology of all sorts in the creation, recording and distribution of the audio arts. I have also experienced both the benefits and the pitfalls of new technology. As in all things, finding the balance between increases in opportunity, access and the &quot;good enough to make money&quot; tendency of business can be difficult. When used simply to cut costs and increase efficiency, the human and economic cost to people trying to get into the business can often over-ride the benefits.  We must work to make sure technology is used to EXPAND creativity, opportunity and quality and not simply cut costs in the &quot;it&#39;s good enough&quot; ethos of much of our business world today. <br/><br/>Generative AI is an exciting technology that has already expanded the universe of who can create music, eliminating traditional barriers to entry and making creativity more accessible. As a tool and instrument, it can unlock unprecedented potential, and push the known limits of music making. But generative AI should not be left unchecked to displace or eliminate human creativity. The Copyright Office must protect human creators. <br/> <br/>As you look to develop new rules and regulations governing generative AI, I urge you to crackdown against the widespread misuse and theft of copyrighted works to train AI models and systems. Music makers, particularly independent creators, are powerless to prevent their copyrighted creations from being ingested without consent or compensation.   <br/> <br/>I also urge you to reinforce the principles of copyright law that are designed to incentivize human creativity and help ensure that outputs from generative AI models do not infringe on existing copyrighted materials. No human should have to compete against a technology infringing their own work to displace them from the market. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to listen to the creators and working professionals most impacted by generative AI.
