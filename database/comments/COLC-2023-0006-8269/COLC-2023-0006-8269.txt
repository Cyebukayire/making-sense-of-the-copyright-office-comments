I&#39;m against AI usage of artists original work to further potential copies and generation of said content. AI-generated content should be strictly limited by art hosting websites such as DeviantART, etc. Where they should require artists to indicate if their artwork is AI-generated or not. Read: Required. The form option when submitting an artwork should have it as a required field, non-optional. This allows users to filter out AI-generated content if they so desire. The site, pixiv, already enforces moderation of AI-generated artwork and may take down artwork that is found to be AI-generated but is not marked such.
