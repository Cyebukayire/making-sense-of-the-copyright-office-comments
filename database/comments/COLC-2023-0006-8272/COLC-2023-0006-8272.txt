I am a musical artist.  I write songs and compose instrumentals.  I then record and perform those songs and instrumentals.<br/><br/>Any AI software that wishes to use my songs or compositions is legally obligated by copyright law, not to mention basic ethics, to first obtain my permission to use them, and negotiate a licensing fee.  Using my works without my permission is piracy and a violation of copyright law.  Any company that engages in such piracy should have their management and board of directors imprisoned for terms of 1 to 10 years, and be prohibited from working in the technology industry for a minimum of 10 years.  The company that engaged in the piracy of copyrighted works must be shutdown, and its assets confiscated and auctioned off, with the proceeds distributed to the songwriters and composers whose works were stolen.<br/><br/>Secondly, any AI software that blatantly copies another musical artist, should suffer the same penalties that humans would suffer, if blatantly copying another artist.<br/><br/>Copyright law must be strengthened to protect creative artists, both from human pirates as well as AI pirates.<br/>
