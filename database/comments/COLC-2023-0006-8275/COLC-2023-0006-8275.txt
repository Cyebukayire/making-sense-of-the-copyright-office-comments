AI &quot;art&quot; and thing generated pr created by artificial intelligence is in no way something able to be copyrighted as it is by technicality not made by a human being.Why is this you ask? This is because though a human puts in the prompt it is code which creates the end product thus creating what is known as &quot;AI art&quot;. One may male the argument that a factory does the same thing but answer me this, does a factory use machines or code to create their product? As AI is code and therefore anything made by it is considered not under copyright but instead under free use as these are made by the individual. Even if you put it on the scale and argue corporations don&#39;t fall into this, they in fact do as it takes prompts to make something, not human beings and works made BY human beings NOT by AI is considered protected by copyright
