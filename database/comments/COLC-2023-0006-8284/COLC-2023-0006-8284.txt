&quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; as it currently exists today, is fundamentally unable to create anything new. The only thing it can do is splice together things it has already absorbed to create something akin to what it has been asked to do and what the formulas behind it determine that to be.<br/>As such, there is no real act of creation happening as I see it.<br/>My belief of the importance of protecting creative endeavors from the intrinsically biased hands of current &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; cannot be understated, and, well, I mean, I use air quotes around &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; because this software is currently completely incapable of thinking.<br/>It is important for every creative pursuit to be protected from &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; because without these protections, every single field of art, be it visual or musical, writing or voice work, will be irreparably damaged forevermore. If protections are not placed to prevent the consumption of these art forms, then the cheap imitations of the real thing will swamp out any actual new or burgeoning talent in any field while simultaneously totally stagnating the entire genre of work. It won&#39;t matter to some particular groups if the field is damaged if they can save a few bucks by not having to actually pay for their art if they can just ask an &quot;AI&quot; to steal someone&#39;s voice, likeness, artistic style, or approach to writing. The only thing they&#39;ll care about is saving money. As a result, it&#39;s important for every field that this &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; is limited in what it can do. The software requires fresh input in order to generate new things, it cannot create something based off of an idea.<br/>I believe that it is important to, above all else, protect the artists at all times from &quot;Artificial intelligence.&quot; Past, present, and future. If an artist of any kind dies, their works should not be allowed to be used by &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; to sow the seed of new potential mixes for it. If someone makes a work of art, the artist should, at the very least, be compensated by any Artificial intelligence companies whenever it is used, as if they were paying royalties on an existing property. That is my opinion on what should be handled for &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; as of today. Anything less, any loopholes in the protections, and the creative fields will be irreversibly damaged, especially in any type of corporate setting.<br/><br/>Just to completely clear up my stance on the matter, if there was an ACTUAL Artificial intelligence that existed and could think entirely for itself, I would be in support for it being treated the same way as a human artist if it chose to create art. Also, because I heard it&#39;s important to specify for your data collection, I am a US Citizen.
