For example, the Japanese Copyright Act has provisions that limit copyright at least for exploitation of a copyrighted work without the purpose of enjoying the thoughts or sentiments expressed in it, and it is desirable that a similar environment be developed also in the United States. On the other hand, the AI Act proposal under consideration in Europe has been discussed in the direction of imposing on AI companies an obligation to provide a detailed summary of the use of training data protected under copyright law. We are carefully watching the developments regarding this point, as it could impose excessive burden on companies providing AI. We consider it desirable for the United States not to introduce such regulation.<br/><br/>Comment on Question 8.<br/>Under Article 30-4 of the Japanese Copyright Act, an act of exploiting a copyrighted work for AI development/training is allowed without the authorization of the copyright owner, unless the action would unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner; therefore, such use is considered to constitute fair use.<br/><br/>Comment on Question 8.3.<br/>Whether the purpose is non-commercial or commercial, an act of exploiting a copyrighted work without the purpose of enjoying the thoughts or sentiments expressed in it, which does not prejudice the economic interests of the copyright owner, is considered to constitute fair use.<br/><br/>Comment on Question 8.3.<br/>It is not realistic to require copyright owners to manifest their intention to opt in or opt out. In addition, the bar is also considered to be extremely high both technical- and cost-wise to identify the manifested intention at the AI training stage.<br/><br/>Comment on Question 9.1.<br/>Consent of the copyright owner is considered not to be required regardless of the purpose of use.<br/><br/>Comment on Question 9.3.<br/>There will be a need to develop technology for identifying the opt-out. Supposing that the opt-out could be identified, if a copyright owner declares its opt out after AI training with materials excluding opted-out copyright works, it is technically difficult to cancel the already trained contents; thus, some arrangement would be needed under the rules to exempt the AI company from liability regarding that part. Moreover, a heavy obligation on AI companies could serve as a barrier for entry into this business, and we are concerned that this would promote an oligopoly by a limited number of companies that can deal with that obligation.<br/><br/>Comment on Question 15.<br/>We oppose imposition of such obligation, but we consider that companies will take reasonable measures in due course based on the awareness that it is important for companies to secure transparency of the AI they provide as a business. However, given that the amount of data used for AI training is enormous, and that the recording/disclosure, etc. of records would exert a considerably large burden on AI companies, we are concerned that such a requirement would restrain use of AI.<br/><br/>Comment on Question 18.<br/>When a human uses AI as a tool for creative expression, the human using the AI could be considered as the author.<br/><br/>Comment on Question 22.<br/>We consider that AI-generated outputs could implicate the rights of preexisting copyrighted works, but even if an output resembles a preexisting work, the determination on the implication is considered to be affected by the extent of dependence on the preexisting work in the generation process. In a case where a training result is output as-is, dependence is likely to be found and the output could constitute an infringement.<br/><br/>Comment on Question 28.<br/>We consider that identification, including labeling, of AI generated materials is not a matter that should be required by law, but a matter that should be independently determined and dealt with by companies based on consumer needs and each company&#39;s ideas in the process of free competition among companies.<br/><br/>Comment on Question 32.<br/>We think that protection of artistic styles is unnecessary, as it would narrow the range of creation/art. In addition, it is considered to be excessive protection to protect even expressions that are not protected by existing intellectual property law, on the basis that they are outputs generated by AI.<br/>
