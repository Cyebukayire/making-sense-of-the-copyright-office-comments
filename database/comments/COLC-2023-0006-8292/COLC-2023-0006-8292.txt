The use of generative AI in creative fields should not be tolerated. Art, music, the very things that make us human should be done by humans. We have a responsibility as a society to ensure these professions and crafts are protected. The arts are the mirror by which we know ourselves and to allow AI to do this work for us will result in untold damage to the human spirit.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the push by large companies to use generative AI is alarming. We have seen evidence time and again that AI is being pushed to devalue the work of actual creatives. The reason is greed, pure and simple.<br/><br/>Could AI be a great tool? Absolutely! But the way people are using and speaking about it now is to use AI to replace artists and other creatives.
