It seems that any artificial intelligence that can generate current era-style art, novels, screenplays, or other forms of copyright protected media must first be trained on, largely, other currently copyright-protected media. Ultimately it&#39;s a no-brainer that if a generative AI needs copyrighted material to create more &quot;modern&quot; media, the AI&#39;s creators should acquire that material legally, with the original creator&#39;s permission, and provide the original creators of that material with a portion of any proceeds they may acquire in the process should that creator desire. <br/><br/>Otherwise, the programmers of these AI will be no better than the bots that already trawl the internet stealing images to put on t-shirts, ultimately defrauding the original artists of both income and credit/name recognition for their work in the process. Children are taught not to plagiarize others&#39; work in schools- how is this any different?
