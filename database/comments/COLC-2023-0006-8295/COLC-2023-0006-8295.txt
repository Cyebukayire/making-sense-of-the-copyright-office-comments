I love AI generation of words and images, but no one should be able to copyright what AI generates.  If I ask DALL-E 3 to create an image in the style of a particular artist, and DALL-E 3 was trained on that artist&#39;s work without their consent, then it should not be possible for me to copyright the resulting work.
