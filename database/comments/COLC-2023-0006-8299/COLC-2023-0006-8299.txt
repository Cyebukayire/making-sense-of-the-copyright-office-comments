AI has provided numerous challenges regarding regulation, to the point where efforts are already in place to &quot;poison&quot; scraped inputs so art is less easily stolen and reproduced without the creator&#39;s consent. I&#39;ve found the most comprehensive analysis on &quot;Here&#39;s What Ethical AI Really Means&quot; on YouTube by a content creator, philosopher and playwright which also sources other artists such as Sarah Andersen. <br/><br/>I think personally at the end of the day AI is like any other technology we have created: capable of being used for good or evil and it&#39;s up to us to make regulations so it is used responsibly. I think one of the worst ways we can use this technology is the large-scale theft that is &quot;AI Art&quot;, and it would be best used on mundane business decisions. With how absent ethics seems to be in corporations already, one would think the best way to use AI for profit would be to replace those at the top who leech the most money but do not, proportionately, work 100x or more &quot;harder&quot; than those at the bottom. <br/><br/>So I do think with regards to specifically copyright and regulations, AI art should be considered what it is: Art theft and use without the artist&#39;s consent on a wide scale. I think that&#39;s where regulations should lie on this matter, consent to use the property in certain ways, just as an artist can say &quot;well, it&#39;s alright if you use this work in something else, just credit me on it please.&quot; Or &quot;parodying this is fine as long as you don&#39;t profit off it!&quot; One could imagine uses for even AI art with consent, such as hiring a team of artists to draw characters in hundreds of different poses and facial expressions and using that input as the AI basis to help speed the animation process. The output of that AI would belong to the same individuals that the initial drawings did. <br/><br/>I think the most important factor is to hear out the concerns of the artists and other workers who create the inputs that AIs scrape. They are rightly concerned this would destroy their livelihoods. Some describing it as even &quot;violating&quot;, due to how personal the art is to them, especially when considering the Internet is a terrible place and AI can turn even the most vile fantasy into an output. <br/><br/>On that note, a concern I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve considered by now is AI being used on real people rather than art, reproducing people&#39;s faces and voices. Politicians, celebrities, even presidents. It should be obvious that regulations are needed to prevent AI being used to produce blackmail, lies, and slander.
