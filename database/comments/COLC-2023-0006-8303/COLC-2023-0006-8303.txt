I am a Software Engineer with experience in training and operating neural networks.<br/><br/>When we searched for images on which to train our neural network, we used only images within a public domain database meant specifically for training neural networks. This was not only due to copyright concerns, but also because of the convenience and quality of the data. To instead scrape massive amounts of data without regard to copyright, as a concept, seems to me to be irresponsible and, put simply, greedy. It is theft of time and labor. Time that those training neural networks would have otherwise spent creating their own data, or collecting data from non-copyrighted sources, is avoided by scraping copyrighted works instead. To benefit from the labor of others without permission or compensation, and to their detriment, is theft.<br/><br/>I will enumerate specific instances.<br/><br/>First, and most obviously egregious, is the instances I have seen of AI-generated film advertisements. These are images of film posters for films that do not exist, made to look like a real advertisement. Some include the actual copyrighted logos of real film corporations, like Disney and Pixar. These are obvious cases of infringement, as the use of a copyrighted logo without permission, even to advertise something that doesn&#39;t exist, is well-established to be infringing.<br/><br/>Second, the AI-generative models able to reproduce a specific individual&#39;s art style. While it can be troublesome to specify language for why this shouldn&#39;t be allowed -- &quot;mimicry is infringement&quot; is too broad -- I will explain specific cases. Suppose an AI-generative model were to reproduce exactly a copyrighted comic strip. This is obvious infringement. Suppose it had replaced the text content of the speech bubbles. This could potentially be considered parody. However, consider the case where an AI-generative model is used to create an entirely new comic strip, as if it had been created by the original artist. Setting aside whether this is sufficiently transformative of the copyrighted training data, it is also utilizing intellectual property without permission -- that being the essential, identifying components of the original comic strip. There is legal precedent for this among other forms of media. See Hosseinzadeh v. Klein, 276 F.Supp.3d 34 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). Put simply, if the new comic strip provides enough of the original strip such that there is now no reason to view the original strip, it is infringing. If it uses little of the original strip, and provides new content instead, it can be considered Fair Use. However, due to the nature of neural networks and how they are trained, it can be argued that all of the content of the new strip is an amalgamation of copyrighted material from many different sources. I believe it should not be a legal loophole that 10% of the new image is the original strip, and is therefore not infringement, because potentially 100% of the new image is derived from several copyrighted sources, in small amounts. A neural network cannot create something truly original. It only utilizes its training data to produce something similar, in a perhaps-unrecognizable form. It is not feasible to determine which parts of the output of a neural network were derived from copyrighted vs. non-copyrighted training data.<br/><br/>Essentially, I believe the output of neural networks trained upon copyrighted materials to be copyright infringement, in a number of cases. I will now comment on who I believe is at legal fault.<br/><br/>In the case of a website that allows users to use generative AI to create images, it can be argued that a user that deliberately creates copyright-infringing images is at fault. However, that allows a user with innocent intentions to accidentally create a copyright-infringing image and be at fault. It is also currently legal precedent that the owner of the website not be held legally responsible for the actions of its users, in specific instances such as this. This, taken together, suggests that no individual can be held at fault.<br/><br/>I disagree. To train a neural network on copyrighted materials is to virtually guarantee future infringement, and therefore, is sufficiently irresponsible to be held legally at fault. Rather than prosecuting individual instances of copyright infringement, it is far more prudent to prosecute the creation of a copyright infringement machine. The decision to train a neural network on copyrighted material is where the legal fault should lie, in my opinion. I believe this will target the newly-infringing behavior, with few side effects to existing systems.
