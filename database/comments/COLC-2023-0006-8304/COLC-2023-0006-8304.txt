Artificial Intelligence should not be using works without permission to generate artwork. Keywords for particular artists and artist styles should also be banned if there are no permissions. Companies are ignoring the inherent nature of copyright and should be forced to shutdown and rewrite models with what they are only allowed to use. If they are never given explicit permission (they should never be allowed to send an email with the clause &ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t respond, we will take that as you allowing/agreeing to your data being used&rdquo;), then they are not allowed to use said artist, writer, creative&rsquo;s data or name. Companies that have already done this should be extremely fined. No slap on the wrists, heavily fined. AI generated artworks or story should be removed from storefronts both digital and physical. Creative works on the internet are absolutely not inherently free and the companies that create AI using these pieces without permission should have to pay artists for every use case that they are able to track and we do know that they can track it.
