I can imagine nothing more corrosive to our copyright law than current Generative AI systems. These systems have been programmed with the works of human authors and are being used to generate new works with the very real potential to replace those authors in the market. I agree with the US Copyright Office&rsquo;s recent clarification (upheld in THALER v. PERLMUTTER et al.) that AI generated works themselves are not copyright eligible. This upholds the Copyright Act of 1976, which itself reaffirmed that authors are necessarily human. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>There needs to be further clarification that the 1st Amendment and its exceptions to copyright (obviously) do not apply to these algorithms. Like copyright, the rights codified in the 1st Amendment do not apply to non-sentient computer systems, lest we grant personhood to those computers, which is ridiculous. Therefore, the wholesale taking of protected human works in order to &#39;launder&rsquo; those works through these systems is categorically not a fair use. Fair use, like copyright, protects the calculated, intentional usage of publicly available protected works for new purposes (criticism, parody, comment, reporting, scholarship, research, etc) by other human beings. These algorithms are not sentient, alive, nor human, thus they are incapable of making fair use claims. These are simply lossy-compression retrieval database systems, trained on mountains of data in order to generate mountains more of images, words, sounds, etc. The obfuscation is deliberate here. The claim of fair use here is moot for the same reason that these probabilistic statistics machines cannot create copyright protected expressions. Furthermore, the humans and corporations deploying these systems cannot claim copyright, nor fair use, for they are not the ones doing the actual work. No amount of prompting, micro-prompting, node-based prompting, etc, can outrun this fact. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>To grant copyright/fair use to computers would break copyright and destroy the ability of humans to compete in copyright-dependent industries. The value of the individual creative in the economy would be diluted if not destroyed completely, and there would be an ever-worsening chilling effect (which we are starting to see) on the sharing of new human-made works. The abuses would be too great, for instance, what would stop a corporation from using its data-farm to generate billions of images/songs/books/etc, all day, everyday. The corporation, by effectively mining &lsquo;new&rsquo; content in perpetuity, could then flood markets with in a constant stream. This chokes out human authorship, while at the same time, the Internet becomes more and more engorged with generated filler. Nobody wants that future, and its already beginning to materialize. Amazon&rsquo;s Kindle Unlimited service recently had to limit &#39;authors&rsquo; to 3 books published per day, billions and billions of fake images are polluting the once useful web, AI songs are filling streaming services, voice AI scams are proliferating, deep-fakes are targeting the vulnerable, while casting doubt over democracies around the world. All enabled by companies using expropriated data, a good chunk of which is protected by copyright, to program their AI models.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Crucially, nowhere to be found in our copyright laws are any protections granted to the &lsquo;expressions&rsquo; of computers, programs or algorithms. These probabilistic statistics machines do not have agency to enjoy copyright protections nor the compliment of 1st Amendment exceptions to copyright that a human being would. Absent the ability to claim fair use on behalf of these AI systems, the AI corporations&rsquo; unauthorized laundering of protected works in their generative systems amounts to mass infringement, undermining both human authorship and copyright.
