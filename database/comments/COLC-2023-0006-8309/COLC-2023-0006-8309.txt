Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America. I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the unauthorized inclusion and use of at least five of my novels in the training of OpenAI&#39;s machine learning models. These novels, for which I hold valid copyrights, were used without my knowledge, consent, or compensation, infringing on my rights as the intellectual property owner. This unauthorized use violates the core principles of copyright protection, which exist to ensure that creators have control over how our works are utilized. If organizations like OpenAI are allowed to use copyrighted content without repercussions, or even properly compensating the creators, it sets a dangerous precedent for other entities to do the same. The very essence of copyright protection is at risk of being diluted, or completely invalidated. I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to take immediate action against Open AI to prevent future infringements of copywritten intellectual properties.    <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Neo Edmund<br/>Long Beach, CA
