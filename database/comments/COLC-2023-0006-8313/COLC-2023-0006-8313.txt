Innovative AI technology is bringing revolutionary changes in technological solutions for everything.<br/>Ever changing technologies always helped creating, producing and recording music and art by introducing various technical tools and software.<br/>A music composition is always a human creation which is captured in audio format utilizing various technical tools, musical instrument and computers today. <br/>If AI technology starts generating music without any creative input by a human (which is very much possible) then we should not consider that piece of music as an art or creative work. Rather, we should find a different term for it.<br/>Personally, I think AI application in music should be limited to designing and generating useful tools or software that can help with music creation but not to generate music itself.<br/>Though it sounds complicated, I would like to explain it this way: If I want to paint a landscape utilizing a computer then I have to use my own idea and skills to complete the painting with options to choose colors, brushes, medium and editing tools etc. If AI generates the painting on the screen because I asked for it then it is not a creation and I shouldn&#39;t claim creative credit for it. Similarly, no one should claim credit for AI generated music neither anybody should claim copyright for it.<br/>Cloning is technological representation of an existing or an imaginary subject and it can&#39;t be called an art work, neither does it represent any creation. What I do understand is AI generated music is actually result of a machine learning process done by copying and cloning millions of composers&#39; and musicians&#39; ideas and creative materials that are accumulated inside the system intelligently as data and delivered to us when and as required in the form of audio.<br/>The biggest problem might arise tomorrow for independent composers, music creators like me who keep hopes on film productions, commercial or TV music productions. If those companies start utilizing AI to generated music or any audio including vocals and voice over for their requirement, one can imagine how many music creators, musicians, composers, vocalists and producers will be jobless.<br/>Let AI be utilized in solving problems of all kind but not for creating music, which is the job of a true musician.<br/>Jayanta Pathak<br/>Composer &amp; Musician
