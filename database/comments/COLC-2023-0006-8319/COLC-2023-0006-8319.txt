To call &#39;data scanning&#39; without the artist&#39;s permission &#39;theft&#39; is like looking over someone&#39;s shoulder to get test answers. It&#39;s cheating, and it&#39;s theft. It is my understanding that the Supreme Court has already ruled that AI results cannot be copyrighted, but nothing is ever settled in law so this could have changed or I could have been misinformed. <br/>The fact of the matter is that the people who are working to create these &quot;AI&quot; solutions are bullying their way to success because they want to have their cake and eat it too. Creative work cannot be be generated by a computer program. Anything that results from that is not a matter of creation, it&#39;s a matter of data processing.
