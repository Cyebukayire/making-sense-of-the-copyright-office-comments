I am a former sociology professor turned novelist. My brain, my efforts, and my unique ideas form the basis of my livelihood and my wellbeing.<br/><br/>My writings are the product of 62 years of thought and life experience and hard work and education. I do not consent to have those cannibalized by AI to allow someone else to steal my ideas or mimic my style. Such theft would not only affect my ability to support myself financially, it would also be a traumatizing violation, as it has already been for all the authors who recently discovered that their works had been used, without their knowledge or consent, to train AI. <br/><br/>Likewise, AI absorption of the teaching and research materials of professors (like I used to be and might be again one day) affects the job security and livelihood of real life teachers and usurps their time and effort, reaping profits for someone who did none of the work--another theft, another traumatizing violation, another profession destabilized. <br/><br/>Automatic insertion without user consent of AI features--some extensive and intrusive--into office and teaching products that writers, researchers, and teachers need to do their jobs endangers the jobs, job security, and intellectual property of these people, trapping us in a situation where, in order to do our jobs, we are forced to subject ourselves to surveillance and idea theft. <br/><br/>I am not a Luddite--I love computers and the ways they facilitate my work and enable me to do more. My objections to AI are not based in a lack of understanding or dislike of technology. My concerns are based in my sociological training and my life experience in a world in which short-sighted people go along with the plans of the greedy to bring about change detrimental to us all. <br/><br/>I am not advocating an end to AI technologies; it&#39;s too late for that and would be impossible. <br/>I am, however, strongly urging you to do 2 things:<br/>1) put in place requirements for TRULY informed consent--perhaps similar to the extensive checklist mortgage officers are required to use with consumers buying or selling houses--to make sure that people fully understand the ways use of an AI product will or might affect them. Right now these products are being &quot;sold&quot; by companies hyping the positive aspects (&quot;do more!,&quot; &quot;make your work easier!,&quot; &quot;work faster!&quot; etc.) without any mention of all the possible ways people might be harmed by the same processes, or any discussion of responsible use to prevent theft of intellectual or artistic property.<br/>2) creation and support of a market for products that DON&#39;T use AI in questionable ways, so that those of us needing those products are not forced to endanger ourselves Then require that employers provide employees with a choice of which type to use.<br/><br/>Thank you for listening. Please, in considering comments like mine, think farther ahead than those who are caught in a giddy rush out of a desire for quick profits they might earn off the hard work of people like me.
