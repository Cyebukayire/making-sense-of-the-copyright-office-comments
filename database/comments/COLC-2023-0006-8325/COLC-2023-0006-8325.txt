Copyright law should exist to protect the value of human labor as it relates to intellectual property. So-called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; used for commercial purposes should not be allowed to devalue human labor, degrade artistic expression and dilute the market for the arts. This should include what content is fed to a program in the process commonly referred to as &quot;machine learning&quot;. While copyright holders should, perhaps obviously, be allowed to consent for their work to be used in this way, they should then be granted a stake in any money generated from the project and should be guaranteed robust compensation. Corporations should not be allowed to economically coerce people into feeding content into &quot;machine learning&quot; programs. Importantly, if a program &quot;scrapes&quot; websites, it is not capable of distinguishing copyrighted material from uncopyrighted material. This practice should be banned.
