As a musician, I am very concerned with the future of my career in light of generative AI. Having AI trained on my music without my consent, and then having music created in my style without any benefit to myself impedes my ability to support myself or make new music. <br/><br/>Generative AI should not be left unchecked to displace or eliminate human creativity. The Copyright Office must protect human creators. <br/> <br/>As you look to develop new rules and regulations governing generative AI, I urge you to crackdown against the widespread misuse and theft of copyrighted works to train AI models and systems. Music makers, particularly independent creators, are powerless to prevent their copyrighted creations from being ingested without consent or compensation.   <br/> <br/>I also urge you to reinforce the principles of copyright law that are designed to incentivize human creativity and help ensure that outputs from generative AI models do not infringe on existing copyrighted materials. No human should have to compete against a technology infringing their own work to displace them from the market. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to listen to the creators and working professionals most impacted by generative AI.
