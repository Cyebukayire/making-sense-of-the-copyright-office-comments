The use of AI in creative industries is quickly making it difficult for artists to survive and make a living. Unlike human artists, who are inspired by and reference other human artists, AI simply steals aspects of artworks and collages them together. To allow this to happen is to place no value on human creation and deny human artists a living. It directly tells artists &quot;your life does not matter, we only care about what product we can squeeze out of you&quot;. If companies are continued allowed to source AI art to make a product, and then make money from that product, it steals from the artists who trained and studied their crafts, often for years, as their work and other artists&#39; work online is being used without consent or payment.
