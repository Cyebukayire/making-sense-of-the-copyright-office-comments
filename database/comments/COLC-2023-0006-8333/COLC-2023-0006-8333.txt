AI, or machine-learning itself is a good resource. However there is so much abuse of it, deepfake&#39;s of friends and family are possible, blackmail with it too.<br/>There will surely be more then enough issues with hacking attacks as that tech develops.<br/>My concern is about the creative space and industry of entertainment.<br/>Copyright issues and the theft of independent work are massive, just alone the possibility of prompting an artist, and imitating his style is insane.<br/>And the fact of warermark-like marks appearing on artificial pictures says more then enough about it.<br/><br/>Individual minds suffer from this, and in this time where mental issues are rising, exactly those minds supposed to uplift with theyr work.<br/>Humanity will suffer from this either way, we can only soften the impact.
