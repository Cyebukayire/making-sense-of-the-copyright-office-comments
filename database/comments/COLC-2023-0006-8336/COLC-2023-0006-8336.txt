Hello, I&#39;m a resident of Korea<br/>My name is Kim Hyunwoo.<br/><br/>First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my opinion like this.<br/><br/>This article is being translated and written by a translator, so it can be a bit awkward or the grammar can be weird.<br/><br/>Currently, I am trying for a long time as an aspiring painter.<br/><br/>My opinion on generative ai is that regulation is essential.<br/><br/>I think that the potential of generative ai is endless, and I think that this allows the art industry to take a step forward, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in its current form.<br/><br/>This is because no market can develop with generative ai in the form of unilaterally exploiting other people&#39;s paintings, faces, bodies, and voices. Rather, we could easily learn from the past &#39;Atari Shock&#39; that it would lead to the collapse of the market.<br/><br/>In addition, as music sites such as Spotify became successful due to the &quot;napster&quot; incident in the past, we can see that a proper market can be formed only with regulations. This case shows that regulation is necessary.<br/><br/>So far, copyright laws seem to be insufficient to lead the era of generative ai. It seems that the direction of expansion is better than strengthening copyright laws.<br/><br/>Because once a company buys at a cheap price, it can use that data forever.<br/><br/>Artists have been trying for decades since they were young to paint that one, and it&#39;s so absurd to spend your whole life on cheap prices. Also, one of the artist&#39;s paintings contains the person&#39;s life, experience, knowledge, thought, purpose, and idea. Learning and analyzing these paintings seems to be more related to authoring moral rights than to authoring property rights.<br/><br/>But preventing future-oriented learning isn&#39;t realistic, so I suggest to the artist that he or she buys and uses paintings with licenses for a certain period of time. Or I hope there is a more reasonable, forward-looking proposal.
