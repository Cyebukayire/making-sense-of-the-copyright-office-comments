Greetings to the agency and affiliated parties, <br/>here is my comment on determining whether AI generated imagery deserves copyright protection or not. <br/>It is my belief that in its current stage of development AI generative technology for images needs regulation, not protection. It has been used to a high degree in circumventing legislation, with the prevalent opinion that &bdquo;what&#39;s available on the internet for viewing, is free to use&ldquo;. <br/><br/>Proof of misuse of AI : <br/>There is also the danger of &bdquo;custom AI models&ldquo; which allow their users to build databases themselves, without any accountability whatsoever. <br/>Here are some links as proof: <br/>1) https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8e11k0WAAAh1sx?format=jpg&amp;name=large  <br/>2) https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8gwwdHWEAAE7Ax?format=jpg&amp;name=medium<br/>3) https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882140/george-r-r-martin-lawsuit-openai-copyright-infringement<br/>4) https://twitter.com/brickroad7/status/1709565473753305203 <br/>5) https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FjNCqVlaAAAFffB?format=png&amp;name=900x900 <br/><br/>There has been a case where an AI-gen user asked chatGPT to provide them with direct prompts to copy a specific drawing without triggering a copyright violation. The result was nearly identical, with the only difference being that &bdquo;this was an image created by AI&ldquo;.<br/>Data for the majority of the AI image generating software relies on the use of website crawlers to collect unlicensed and non-consenting work of artists for profit. Even when artists find themselves in these databases, they are not given a choice to opt-out of the data collection system. This leads to AI-generated images including elements with ill-defined and unclear property rights. Please be aware that you are dealing with synthetic data. Some websites have begun putting effort into preventing misuse of AI: <br/><br/>Proof of attempts to remedy the issue: https://www.pixiv.net/info.php?id=9540  , https://cara.app/faq#ai-stance , https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F6fzRy8XEAAGnn6?format=jpg&amp;name=medium <br/>Real-life name prompting and intention of targeting a specific artist&rsquo;s work has been common in this field. No notice, no consent and no payment. Without fair practice measures and transparency, copyright should NOT be given to AI images, regardless of the amount of human input. I believe there would be signifficant negative effects of allowing copyright for AI-generated imagery. The source and intention of these works cannot be held accountable because no ethical AI generative model exist (yet). This is a young field and it&#39;s growth must be carefully steered not to lead into catastrophe. <br/><br/>Please take this topic with the gravity it deserves. There is such a large degree of AI misuse, that unions are being created in an effort to guide policy making (the WGA, SAG-AFTRA, The Concept Art Association). The quality and market value of the AI products the generator can create depends directly on the data it obtains. The data is the issue here. <br/><br/>I suggest looking into offering protection once fair practice becomes a part of the industry.<br/>Name: F.
