Hello, I&#39;m a concerned professional freelance artist. <br/><br/>Issues with AI image generation and ML generation keeps getting worse and worse with each day. Companies such as Mid Journey, NovelAI, Stability AI, Open AI have taken millions up to billion artworks from artists all around the world, without permission and till this day they still use it to scam people. None of these generative programs could work without all these artworks which were put into them, illegally. Artists have copyright to their own creations and works, and seeing their work being used like this is a proof of a failing regulations. Regulations need to be updated as technologies advance. Currently, artists all around the world have their works constantly used and abused by various people using these programs. They profit off of artist&#39;s hard work. Companies are laying off professional artists because it is cheaper to just use &#39;&#39;AI image generation program&#39;&#39;. <br/>I never wanted to see a day where people can look over this crime and think nothing of it. We have movies based on main characters plotting to steal famous paintings from the museums, but none of those plots have anything on the current biggest art scam scheme that has ever happened in the entire history. This is a scam on a global level. It is illegal, and people do not feel safe posting their artwork online anymore. We need to be protected. Regulations need to happen, and artists need to be protected, their livelihood needs to be protected and their works need to be protected. We are workers just as any other, and we have our rights and want to be heard.<br/><br/>These past few years, artists and their work have been endlessly taken and abused, and we keep waiting and waiting for regulations to come. Yet the only help we got was when we helped ourselves. Artists use fundraisings to have their voice heard in the parlaments across the world, and people from universities are making a program which will protect our art for free. (edited)<br/><br/>In a world where everything is visual and everything we do, use or see is in one way or another connected to art and our craft, I just can&#39;t imagine how in the end, nobody wants to protect us when protection is needed. Please don&#39;t lets us fight this fight alone. Respect artists, their work and their copyright. They quite literally make a world a better place.<br/><br/>I am an artist, under the name Lucy R. <br/>I write to you on my own behalf.<br/>Thank you for reading.
