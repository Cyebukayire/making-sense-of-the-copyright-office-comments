As a music maker, I appreciate the Copyright Office&#39;s Notice of Inquiry on generative artificial intelligence and copyright, and I urge the office to incorporate the perspective of artists, songwriters, producers and other individual creative workers. Your work will influence generations of creators, and safeguarding human creativity must remain the foundation of any future rule or regulation. <br/> <br/>Generative AI is an exciting technology that has already expanded the universe of who can create music, eliminating traditional barriers to entry and making creativity more accessible. As a tool and instrument, it can unlock unprecedented potential, and push the known limits of music-making. However generative AI should not be left unchecked to displace or eliminate human creativity. The Copyright Office must protect human creators. <br/> <br/>As you look to develop new rules and regulations governing generative AI, I urge you to crack down against the widespread misuse and theft of copyrighted works to train AI models and systems. Music makers, particularly independent creators, are powerless to prevent their copyrighted creations from being ingested without consent or compensation.   <br/> <br/>I also urge you to reinforce the principles of copyright law that are designed to incentivize human creativity and help ensure that outputs from generative AI models do not infringe on existing copyrighted materials. No human should have to compete against a technology infringing their own work to displace them from the market. <br/><br/>Thank you for listening to the creators and working professionals most impacted by generative AI.
