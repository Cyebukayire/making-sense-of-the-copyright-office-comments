I personally am concerned about the artistic monopoly that may proceed to happen if AI generated images earn copyright. Because these images are so random and infinite, I am concerned about the artistic freedoms that may burden actual visual artists. I am concerned of further litigation of infringement from artists who may accidentally infringe on an AI generated work. I am concerned for artists who now have to steer clear and be wary on how they draw and paint basic images. Since these AI generated artworks are mainly just meshes of images taken from copyrighted authors or from the public domain, there is not enough human creation to really make it subject to copyright. Additionally, allowing these images to be subject to copyright may ignite increased litigation and judicial resources as people fight over who should get the valid copyright for their image. It is best to keep AI generated images as a fun way to create random art, but not take away actual artistic integrity or make visual artists feel like they are walking on eggshells every time they make a painting.
