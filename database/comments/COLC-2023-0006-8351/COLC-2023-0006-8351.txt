While AI generated image technology has its benefits, it exploits hundreds of thousands of human creatives, scraping their work without knowledge or consent. AI technology will not go away. The most realistic solution is to require AI generated imagery to be disclosed, and as AI generated content cannot be copyrighted, AI generated content cannot be used for profit without the consent of all artists involved in training the model. Models must disclose their dataset, and must get consent of all creators involved.<br/><br/>The main issue behind AI generation models is stealing content and deceiving viewers, who perceive the &quot;AI artist&quot; produced the content themselves. With proper regulation, we can find a middle ground for this technology that will protect artists and satisfy image generation users
