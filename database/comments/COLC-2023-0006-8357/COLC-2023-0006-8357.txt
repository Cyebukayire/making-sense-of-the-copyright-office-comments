I comment from Japan.<br/>I usually drew pictures, but was not able to describe it in a heart after generative AI came up.<br/>I have the concern of &quot;deep fake&quot; which is more terrible than it.<br/>Politicians ignorant about digital in Japan do not pay attention for this danger from a beginning.<br/>Please please suggest appropriate regulation from your country before information uncertain overflows.<br/><br/>I think that a machine does not have to perform &quot;generation&quot;.<br/>What I need is a way to access the correct sources of information.<br/>Even if future worry was very severe, I want to believe wisdom of the human being.
