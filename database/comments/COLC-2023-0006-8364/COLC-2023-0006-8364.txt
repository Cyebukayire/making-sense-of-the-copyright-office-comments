As a photographer, songwriter/musician, former filmmaker, entertainment lawyer and former filmmaker, I appreciate the Copyright Office&#39;s Notice of Inquiry on generative artificial intelligence and copyright.  I urge the Office to incorporate the perspective of artists, photographers, songwriters, film and musi  producers and other individual creative workers. The work you are undertaking will influence generations of creators, and safeguarding human creativity must remain the foundation of any future rule or regulation. <br/> <br/>Generative AI should not be left unchecked to displace or eliminate human creativity. The Copyright Office must protect human creators. <br/> <br/>As you look to develop new rules and regulations governing generative AI, I urge you to crack down on the widespread misuse and theft of copyrighted works to train AI models and systems. Music makers, photographers and others, particularly independent creators, are powerless to prevent their copyrighted creations from being ingested without consent or compensation.   <br/> <br/>I also urge you to reinforce the principles of copyright law that are designed to incentivize human creativity and help ensure that outputs from generative AI models do not infringe on existing copyrighted materials. No human should have to compete against a technology infringing their own work to displace them from the market. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to listen to the creators and working professionals most impacted by generative AI.
