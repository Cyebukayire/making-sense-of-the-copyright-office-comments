I am an actor whose image was taken by a motion picture studio to be used for future AI use with no information on how they will actually use it. Even if they claim that they will only use it for the project that I was working on that day, there is currently no way to know the type of scene where they would use an AI-generated image. It could possibly be an offensive scene I would never have agreed to work in had I been approached to be hired for a day of filming. There are also reports of development of software where they can take my image and alter it enough so it was trained on me but will no longer be recognizable as me. I support the idea that any artist should have control over anything of theirs (in any medium) that is used to train AI.
