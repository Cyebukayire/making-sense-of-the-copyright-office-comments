To see their desires, what they&rsquo;re passionate about, to understand them on a level that isn&rsquo;t possible with speech alone. You simply cannot do this with an AI, if we attempt to automate human artists out of existence, we will lose a crucial part of our humanity and our identity as a society.<br/><br/>I urge the US copyright office to stand with artists and prevent AI generated images from being copyrighted.
