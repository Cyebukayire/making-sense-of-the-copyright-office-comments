This is an addendum to a previous comment I submitted containing new information.<br/><br/>CivitAI is a popular website for distributed models trained on various subjects.  Their service provides people with the tools they need to create deep fakes of various celebrities or public figures and reproduce the style of various artists without consent of the original rights holders.<br/><br/>They recently announced a competition encouraging people to train models on unwilling artists with multiple thousands of dollars in the prize pool.  This is direct profit from the work of artists that should be protected by copyright, capturing their style in a way that serves to replace them and circumvent their property rights.<br/><br/>https://civitai.com/articles/2755
