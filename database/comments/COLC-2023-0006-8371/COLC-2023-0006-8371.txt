I am an artist running a small successful one-person business around my artwork (~10,000$ in profit per year). I personally feel that like Photoshop or reference tools, generative AI should also be treated as a tool for artists or creatives. I do use AI tools in my creative process to help brainstorm ideas for composition, color, etc. in my artwork. I have also seen other artists make magnificent collages using AI artworks in creative ways. Therefore, I feel that as long as the AI artwork is altered by a human it should be copyrightable, and the use of AI in the creative process for a human-made art (where each new addition to the artwork was a human decision) should be allowed and encouraged.
