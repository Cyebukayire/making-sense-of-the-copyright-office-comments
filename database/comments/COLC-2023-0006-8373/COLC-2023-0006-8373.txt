AI is just that. Artificial intelligence. All you do is enter a prompt and a machine does it for you. That&#39;s not art. And where does the machine get the &#39;art&#39; it makes from? People who drew it in the first place. Sure, a human entered the prompt.<br/><br/>But they did none of the work. It just popped onto the screen in an instant. There is no joy of creation or satisfaction.<br/><br/>A human did not make any of it.
