AI image generation (Midjourney, etc) and writing (ChatGPT, etc) are, by and large, trained on images which they have no legal right to manipulate and reuse. At this time, there is no ethical way to use AI to produce artwork or written materials, and their use is already proving detrimental to artists, writers, musicians, and others in creative fields. The continued rampant misuse of AI will not only prove destructive to human creators, but as public opinion sours, it will also stifle the legitimate uses of AI being developed, like software that can predict the recovery of patients with brain injuries. Please, put a stop to the most prolific situation of copyright infringement the world has ever seen.
