As an intellectual property and competition law practitioner since the time the 1976 Copyright Act was enacted and while the copyrightability of computer software was still being debated, my response to questions 18-22 on copyrightability of &quot;AI-generated&quot; works is that existing U.S. statutory law should be applied to require human &quot;conception&quot; (as in Burrows-Giles and U.S. patent law), but that the CO&rsquo;s Guidance (88 FR 16190), that artists and authors who use AI tools resulting in &quot;appreciable&quot; &quot;AI generation&quot; must disclaim AI-generated work for registration, should be rethought and replaced by a rule that, so long as the use of AI tools is disclosed and a claim is made that use is directed by human conception, registration (required for enforcement) should be allowed -- perhaps with a weaker presumption of validity (as for computer software registrations) -- and allow the market (and in rare cases, the courts) to make the determination of whether exclusive copyright rights are warranted and how &quot;thin&quot; they might be relative to any infringement of those rights.<br/><br/>This way, instead of the CO requiring that artists and authors disclaim works that have &quot;appreciable&quot; AI contribution, would-be infringers, licensees and purchasers can make their own determination and possibly negotiate with the artists and authors.  This has worked for nearly a half-century with increasingly automated software development leading to the kind of &quot;progress&quot; for which art. I, sec. 8, cl. 8 delegated to Congress to power to award to authors and inventors exclusive copyright and patent rights -- progress that has included much of the automation now called &quot;AI&quot; and &quot;generative AI.&quot;  The same framework of conception has allowed copyrightability for 150 years of substantially automated image-capture in Burrows-Giles, and even more mundane capture in Bleistein -- and the market, as in software, makes it unlikely that thin copyrights (such as in routine image capture as dictated by operational specifications) are litigated.  Again, both software and photography have flourished under market dynamics without prior regulatory restraint.<br/><br/>To the extent that one might argue that art. I, sec. 8, cl. 8 might limit copyrightability of &quot;AI-generated&quot; works even if conceived and directed by humans, recall that (1) since the 19th century and re-confirmed in the 1976 Act, the incidents (and thus incentive) of authorship is awarded to not-necessarily-human employers in &quot;works for hire&quot; (although it is assumed, before distributed autonomous organizations, that the employers are still directed by humans; and (2) after rejection under the Copyright Clause in the Trademark Cases of the 19th century, the Lanham Act was enacted under the delegation of power to Congress under the Commerce Clause -- indeed, that was the fallback argument to support the 1976 Copyright Act&#39;s doing away with the prior &quot;publish with a copyright notice&quot; quid-pro-quo under art. I, sec. 8, cl. 8, still adhered to in the Patent Act (though arguably weakened by the AIA).<br/><br/>Although it&#39;s moving quickly - and perhaps because it is moving quickly -- generative AI (which by the NOI/RFC&#39;s definition arguably includes the output of content provided by legal research systems since the 1970s) as a tool of innovators including artists and authors should not be limited by an administrative agency that has limited resources to examine the individual case merits.  That was and remains true of other automation, including computer software and image capture/enhancement.<br/>
