As an art student in university, I believe that generative ai programs like midjourney have created, and will continue to create an online environment that is hostile to artists. I see very little incentive to share my artworks online, when the act of posting my artwork means that ai programs will train off my work, and become more effective at copying my style. In other words, as I show more artwork to the world, digital doppelgangers will become more proficient at mimicking me, which devalues my artworks, my profession, and my identity. Anything unique that I create will be instantly taken by these programs and copied at a mass scale, which dilutes any impact the artwork could have originally made, and erases my identity as an artist. In any other circumstances, these actions would be regarded as plagiarism, yet ai programs and images proliferate because they are unregulated. The more art I create, the more I will become obsolete in the industry, so why would I or anyone else continue to pursue the path of an artist, when all that job really means is to become data cattle for corporations? I see this relationship between artist and ai as a dynamic of parasitism, and I believe I and many other people in the young adult demographic is looking at the art field with an air of extreme pessimism. What&#39;s happening now is nothing but theft, theft of identities and intellectual properties. I believe the entire point of copyright itself is to prevent such cases of theft, in order to create an environment where artists and creators feel safe that they are protected from theft by the law. If there continues to be no protection for artists and their artworks from generative ai, then the art market itself would become free pickings for bandits.
