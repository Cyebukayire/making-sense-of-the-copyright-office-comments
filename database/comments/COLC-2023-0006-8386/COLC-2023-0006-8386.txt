Reading the request for comments, an overarching response that comes to mind, despite my appreciation of the breadth of the request, is that most of these questions would be most properly answered by government Judges exercising their interpretation and judgement of the existing law.  And then legislators responding to those judgements with evolution of the law.  Of course the problem with that, is that seems to lead to things like the $222,000 penalization of Jammie Thomas-Rasset that was upheld by SCOTUS[1].  I find the current set of copyright laws to be more harmful than beneficial as a result of that kind of persecution of digital file sharing.  While yes, those files may have been shared to criminal profiteering copyright pirates, they may have also been shared to people fairly using them noncommercially to educate/&#39;train&#39; their own brains or the brains of their human children.  And yes, those resultingly &#39;trained&#39; brains might later go on to commercially profit from their ability to better express the styles of the artists whose works trained them, that does not necessarily rise I think to the level where a government Judge should/would Automatically convict them without giving Due Process consideration to the specific crimes they had been accused of and charged with.  I am 48 years old, and if I could afford the time I could easily write a 500 page response to this broad request for comments.  But alas I cannot.  However what I can bring up, is that I bear witness to the history of how horrible the U.S. copyright regime has been in regards to such simple questions as to whether or not a person is legally allowed to digitally back up music from a cd-rom and copy it to more modern technology music players without ANY fear of something like the $222,000 judgement, or the terrorizing FBI warning screens so many in my generation were Forced to watch by DVD players that would deprive their users of the trivial ability to skip or fast forward through if they weren&#39;t tech savvy and legally audacious enough to risk using, e.g. a linux computer system to more flexibly watch the DVD movie that they physically paid for and possess, not to mention the case of alternately downloading a better copy with a service like &#39;the pirate bay&#39; perhaps with the help of a domestic or foreign vpn service to avoid interestingly worded forwardings of allegations to them from their ISPs (such as I have received a few times in the past few years relating to my acquisition of Star Trek content, which I have a lifelong fair use artistic relationship with, but which I cannot stand to pay any more money for in a post-GITMO U.S. regime, let alone in formats and services that I consider deficient when it comes to my needs as an artist &#39;training&#39; myself (without &#39;AI&#39; software).  (I like to have very flexible control over fast forward, rewind, pause, and partial copying abilities.  Thank goodness for innovative time shifting technologies.)<br/><br/>Good Luck,<br/><br/>-dmc<br/>Douglas McClendon<br/><br/>[1] https://www.wired.com/2013/03/scotus-jammie-thomas-rasset/<br/>
