As both an IT student and artist I sincerely believe there is nothing inherently wrong with AI generated images. HOWEVER, as it stands now, the datasets upon which AI image generative tools work upon STOLEN data scraped from the internet without their original author&#39;s consent, which I strongly believe is unethical. Many pro-AI speakers argue that the stolen art is merely a component of the AI &quot;machine&quot; and not the end product, and thus it is not in breach of copyright laws, yet that completely omits the fact that companies hosting AI image generation services are profiting off the WHOLE of the AI &quot;machine&quot;, therefore even if the stolen artworks are only a component of it, they are still profiting off of them. Whether they like to admit it or not, their AI and neural networks would be nothing without the data that they&#39;ve stolen. No matter how much they would like to understate the importance of the datasets which they base their work upon, the fact of the matter is that the stolen content is the keystone to allowing the AI produce such high quality images, a neural network without nothing to train on is literally useless. <br/>Thankfully, I&#39;ve never had any of my art stolen for purposes of being AI training data (at least that I&#39;m aware of) but I&#39;ve been witness to many of my artist friends and artist whom I look up to going through that experience and it is truly heartbreaking. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that AI image generation programs can and WILL majorly impact the creative market as a whole, if they haven&#39;t already. Often you will see people sharing prompts which they&#39;ve used to generate images including specific artists&#39; names to get the output in the desired style. That to me feels like blatant encroaching on a given artist&#39;s market, like stealing their art instead of commissioning them. While it is of course true that an artist cannot trademark/copyright the style they draw in, if a potential client wanted an artwork in a specific artist&#39;s style without paying their prices and staying on the side of the law, they would still need to find and commission another artist of sufficient skill to replicate the first artist&#39;s artstyle (without infringing on any actual copyrighted material, of course). In that way AI is taking away potential customers from artists big and small.<br/>There are also concerns in terms of big companies using AI generative tools in order to minimize the pay to their employees. For example, someone who used to be a lead design artist could be demoted into an assistant designer whose job would be only to &quot;clean up&quot; AI generated images, or work based off them. Whether or not that is the same amount of work or less is a discussion for another time, what matters is that an assistant position almost certainly will pay less than a lead, which will undoubtedly affect the financial situation of an artist put in that kind of situation. Not only that with &quot;AI&quot; taking up job spots at companies the market for creative work will become more unstable than ever, with people losing their jobs to machines stealing their art.<br/>If we wish to continue to live in a society which embraces AI art, we need to make at least two changes:<br/>1) Make it MANDATORY for any and all image datasets used in training AI to be obtained with the author&#39;s consent in an OPT-IN system (as opposed to assuming consent and allowing an opt-out system), as well as any companies using said datasets awarding the artists royalties per image included in the dataset on a monthly basis.<br/>2) Put restrictions on companies, preventing them from using generative content to replace human workers, so as to not destabilize the current job market. AI should only ever be used as an assisting tool in the creative process.
