Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>Please take time to seriously consider all the joy and pleasure that the living creative community in America and around the world has delivered to you, your family and every member of the human tribe.<br/><br/>As one member of that creative community, that living fount of exciting, dramatic, emotional, frightening, educational, thrilling experiences, I&#39;m here to express to you that all of us in the United States, creators and consumers, cannot permit the technical world, the unfeeling and uncaring circuits and systems to be the pseudo feeling deliverers of so-called creative material absolutely devoid of heart and soul, humor and caring. <br/><br/>And then, please think about all the creative beings in America who have given birth to all that powerful entertainment that only a feeling human being can create. DO WE CAST THEM ASIDE? Do we allow artificial inteligence to usurp our creativity? So that circuits and servers can take over? <br/><br/>I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America and I URGE THE U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE TO PRIORITIZE HUMAN CREATIVITY AND CREATIVE WORKERS during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Many thanks for considering my vital comments and the livelihoods of so many in the creative community. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Tom Heyes<br/>Sherman Oaks, CA
