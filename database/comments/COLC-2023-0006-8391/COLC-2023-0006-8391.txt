Q. 5: New legislation is warranted to address copyright law due to the extraordinary advancement and ease of content creation. A new category of authorship such as &quot;AI-curator&quot; could prove useful. <br/>Q. 9: Copyright owners should have to affirmatively &quot;opt-in&quot; to have their materials used for training AI models. This approach should apply to both commercial and noncommercial purposes.  <br/>Q.10: Copyright owners consent should be required to train AI models. This can be an onerous task. A method that might be useful is that of a &quot;clearinghouse&quot; where authors agree to their works being used for AI purposes at a flat fee. Then AI developers could use pre-approved clearinghouse materials to train their AI models. Another method would be the use of open source and public domain materials for free use for all AI developers (likely already in use).  <br/>Q.15: Developers of AI models should be required to keep and disclose records of materials used to train AI models.<br/>Q.19: Yes, revisions to the Copyright Act are necessary to clarify human authorship. Content generated by AI could receive the same copyright consideration as compilation albums (e.g., a singing artist&#39;s greatest hits).
