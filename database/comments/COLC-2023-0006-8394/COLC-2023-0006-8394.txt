These are my comments as an American human writer, poet, recording artist, and actor.  <br/>Thank you for allowing me a place in this vital forum.  These words were written by me, a human American with no assistance by any (ai) programming.  Human work only. <br/><br/>Art of all kinds for both the creator and the human being experiencing it, reflects life lived as a human being.  Art carries soul imbued by the human author or artist and therefore is enshrined inalienable rights by its existence and by those laws specially written at the very forefront our constitution. <br/><br/>The idea of those laws so written was not only to protect art created by American humans but also to encourage authentic artists to continue creating it. <br/>Aside from the obvious problems of the unchecked abuse and theft of American creative works of art, literature, film, sound et al, by these companies marketing untested mimicry and plagiarism software,<br/>the broader impact is a chilling effect on American artistry.  It gives authentic artists significant reason to stop creating new works which normally would have been shared and thereby enrich America, the public, and our economy.  Why would America want to incur such damage, such loss, in trade for profits to only a small number of tech firm power heads?<br/><br/>America is known first and loved throughout the world for its entertainment- film, music, literature and visual arts.  Any threat to the authentic production of original American artforms that continue that legacy and America&rsquo;s growth results in loss for our country far beyond the individual level, to the serious detriment of our country as a whole. <br/><br/>Moving backward in this egregious wrongheaded way is not innovation, modern, growth or forward progress.  It is cutting the beating heart of American artistry made only and uniquely by humans here in our country for centuries.  <br/><br/>First and immediately, sales by these companies for profit on the backs of uncredited, stolen, works of art in all forms plus records of biogenic data (voices) by means of said companies&rsquo; new automated processes, must stop now. <br/><br/>It is time to arrest this crime as it happens. <br/><br/>The illegality of such theft often unbeknownst by the authors creators or human American owners should be communicated and demonstrated to the public worldwide as loudly and broadly as possible. <br/><br/>This may be done by new law, as it seems we are currently creating,<br/>but also by exercising<br/>current law protections. <br/>It is my suggestion that the copyright office and any other cooperating American office provide authentic human creators, artists and performers clear roadmaps or paths via public campaigns to help them quickly understand how they are currently protected and ways to protect themselves and their works further by providing new additional clauses, signage, and suggestions artists may fortify themselves with when presenting any piece. <br/><br/>Moreover, please craft and utilize the current laws to end this theft and abuse. <br/>I concur with all that I heard in the FTC&rsquo;s roundtable discussion with heads of creative unions and sectors. That control, consent, credit, and compensation must reside with the human authors /owners and needs to be clearly assured to authentic authors of works. <br/>Also that any new laws crafted make explicit that use against an author&rsquo;s will is punishable by law. <br/><br/>This includes all offenders from the random individual abuser stealing a work or recorded biogenic material (voice) to desecrate a chaste image or recording and the human it belongs to into pornographic or racist or hateful materials, all the way up to the very powerful organization heads (CEOs) at these handful of American tech firms pushing relentlessly for unbridled sales and acceptance of software that is seriously damaging <br/>American humans and our economy and country itself. <br/><br/>Thank you. <br/><br/>A final note~ it seems also arguable this act on the part of companies using artists&rsquo; works without consent or compensation (for products that will compete with that human artists own works, reputation, &amp; professional or personal identity, may also be a form of intellectual terrorism, if not certainly abuse of civil rights.  It is diminishing creative works and persons by means of theft and force to subvert the will and freedoms of human artists and authors to freely express and create as a product of their lived human experiences. <br/><br/>~ An American citizen &amp; Artist<br/>Poetry Music Film Spoken Word
