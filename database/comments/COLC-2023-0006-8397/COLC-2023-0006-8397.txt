We&rsquo;re in the Wild West phase of generative AI technology. Massive harm is being inflicted upon creative markets by fraudulent actors in the name of innovation and transformative fair use, and most organizations for creative professionals across the world have spoken up. While true innovation and lateral value creation does happen in the field, and is spectacular, IP law has its work cut out in urgently addressing the parts of professed value creation that is simply a direct value transfer from creators, their licensees, their heirs and other rights holders, to AI companies and their users.<br/><br/>The following is based on research into the workings, licenses and sources of Stable Diffusion and Midjourney over this past year, including the Laion-5B dataset and the commercial exploitation ecosystem around these systems, chiefly Promptbase, CivitAI and Adobe Stock, and its impact on creators. It is based on a professional understanding of international content licensing within print and digital publishing, and data-driven service and business development.<br/><br/>A key point for the purpose of the reasoning below is that AI models are being misconstrued as technology, whereas by technical and commercial nature they are content repositories. Key to their value proposition is extraction of expressive content from underlying works, in direct violation of the interests of authors and rights-holders, hugely detrimental to their marketplace value and the cultural and creative industries as a whole:<br/><br/>What were previously display windows and marketplaces for commissions and licensing have become scraping grounds for free raw material for replacements.<br/>What was previously cultural capital and a passive income source for artists and authors has been weaponized into directly competing works.<br/><br/>In a cruel twist of irony, online popularity, having ones&rsquo; works shared widely by fans, has been turned from free marketing or petty nuisance into replacement quality.<br/><br/>Given this massive and ongoing theft, there is currently little to no marketplace incentive to create works using anything BUT generative AI, let alone to publish any works on the open internet nor any major platform. Informed opt-in collective licensing, as already proposed by Author&rsquo;s Guild and others before, and already extant for other media and for other uses, and indeed standard procedure for AI training until just recently, would restore balance.<br/><br/>Continued in attachment
