Generative AI should be able to train on publically available data regardless of copyright status, but should not be able to be invoked by prompting to imitate an individual&#39;s voice, likeness or visual products so as to mitigate potential impersonation and prevent it from becoming a tool used to exploit creators. The purpose of allowing training on copyrighted material is beneficial so as to prevent monopolisation and allow for healthy open source start-ups whilst still encouraging and rewarding innovative practises and novel creations.
