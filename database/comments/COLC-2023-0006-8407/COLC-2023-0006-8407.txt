I think a copyright should be extended to an AI image if the image is original enhanced by a human. It depends how much post generation work was created on the base image. I agree that the primary AI generated image shouldn&#39;t be copyrighted. But if that base image was substantially enhanced, then that edited/enhanced version should be protected. I have done AI images that have taken over 20 hours of photo editing to improve the base AI image.<br/><br/>Warhol didn&#39;t create the base image of his screen prints but substantially altered them. And in doing so, created his personal interpretation of that base image . And his work is copyrighted. The portrait I&#39;ve attached took about 20 hours to edit to remove the glitches in the original A/I image. I&#39;ve also included other images that required substantial modifications to the original base A/I generation.
