I have been thinking &amp; writing about the intersection of AI &amp; copyright for a few years&mdash;well before the release of LLM&rsquo;s that have captured public attention. Over these years, my thinking has evolved. While my first examination of US law and AI contemplated the possibility of ECL, I no longer believe that is an acceptable solution. Indeed, given the centrality of AI in society, I no longer believe that ECL would be consistent with our international obligations under Berne, the so-called WIPO Internet Treaties, TRIPS, and numerous bilateral trade agreements. In particular, AI is no longer a &ldquo;special case&rdquo; within the meaning of these legal instruments, and we therefore lack the ability to impose conditions on the exercise of exclusive rights. I have attached links to a number of documents that are responsive to the questions you have posed. I hope you find these helpful in your important &amp; timely examination of these issues.<br/><br/>https://medium.com/@nturkewitz_56674/sustainable-text-data-mining-part-ii-us-and-fair-and-unfair-uses-770e4aad705<br/><br/>https://medium.com/@nturkewitz_56674/copyright-and-artificial-intelligence-an-exceptional-tale-60bdd77a8f13<br/><br/>https://medium.com/@nturkewitz_56674/ai-copyright-fair-use-avoiding-the-artificial-in-intelligence-maintaining-our-humanity-82af5f48ca37<br/><br/>https://medium.com/@nturkewitz_56674/searching-for-global-copyright-laws-in-all-the-wrong-places-an-examination-of-the-legality-of-cec358492285<br/><br/>https://medium.com/@nturkewitz_56674/the-fair-use-tango-a-dangerous-dance-with-re-generative-ai-models-f045b4d4196e<br/><br/>
