Purely prompt-generated AI works should not be eligible for copyright as the creation of a prompt is largely similar to commission-based works. There is not enough human decisions going into the final product as the prompting, unlike photography, gives little to confidently predict what image is to be produced by the prompt given. Very few decisions are given to merit copyright status. More abstract methods such as AI-assisted creation should be case-by-case, such as using an image given by AI as a starting point for further work, which may involve more human authorship.
