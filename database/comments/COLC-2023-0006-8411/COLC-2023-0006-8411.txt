I comment from japan.<br/>After the head of Stability AI admitted that he used billions of images for Stable Diffusion training without obtaining the consent of the copyright owner&#39;s. It is distinct that generative artificial intelligence (AI) dataset steals  intellectual property from all over the world and is a copyright violation. But part of the <br/>Japan copyright act was amended to allow copyrighted works to be used without permission(Article30-4) it has come into effect in 2020.<br/>My portfolio was trained  by a company-CyberAgent(Cygames) without my permission.<br/>It is guessed that from the promotion of generative artificial intelligence by American companies such as Google, Microsoft ,and Adobe as well as the Japanese government, politicians, large companies, advertising agencies, universities lead to international  also inhumane copyright infringement and corruption.
