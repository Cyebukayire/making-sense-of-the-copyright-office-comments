To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>I am writing in response to the US Copyright Office&#39;s request for public comments on copyright issues surrounding generative AI systems. <br/><br/>As an architect, artist, educator and author who has taught thousands of students on Generative AI applications across prestigious institutions, I offer informed perspective from over 25 years of experience at the nexus of technology and creativity. My credentials include a Master of Architecture from Yale University, an MBA from NYU Stern School of Business, and a BA from Wellesley College where I received the Plostergerth Prize in Art History. I am the founder of Synthetivity, an avant-garde enterprise focused on educational programs and thought leadership around responsible AI innovation. My upcoming book &quot;Temperature: Creativity in the Age of AI&quot; further demonstrates my qualifications to comment on the complex intersection of copyright law and Generative AI.<br/><br/>With this context, I believe it is imperative that we thoughtfully navigate this complex intersection of technology and creative rights. My perspective is informed by a series of newsletters I wrote exploring multifaceted aspects of this issue from various viewpoints. Based on my analysis, I wish to make the following recommendations:<br/><br/>Training Data Protections<br/><br/>Generative AI models should not be permitted to access copyrighted source material without prior authorization from rights holders. Scrapes of protected works on the internet, including images and text shared on social media, should require opt-in consent, not just assumed fair use. For-profit companies benefiting commercially from AI systems should be expected to properly license data, not exploit loopholes at the expense of artists.<br/><br/>Respecting Creative Commons licenses is equally important. If creators indicate their work is available for certain uses under CC terms, those permissions and restrictions should be honored. This allows a middle-ground between full copyright and public domain, serving the public good while preserving attribution.<br/><br/>Output Copyrightability<br/><br/>I believe AI-generated works meeting originality thresholds should remain eligible for copyright protection. The final output should be evaluated on its own merits, not discounted due to its generative origins. AI systems creatively synthesize inputs probabilistically; they do not simply copy or directly reproduce training material. If a human artist exerts creative choices in generating and curating AI output into a finished work, whether through a simple prompt or more complex workflow, this should satisfy authorship requirements. Those choices could arise from statistical anomalies like a lucky snapshot, or more controlled direction - but it is the end result that matters, not the creative process. AI-generated works demonstrate originality through novel recombinations of data, not rote reproduction. As such, they should be judged like any other work based on the end product rather than the means of production when considering copyright eligibility.<br/><br/>Nuanced Infringement Analysis<br/><br/>Infringement claims should still apply to AI-generated content based on end results rather than process. Works mimicking or too substantially similar to copyrighted material should face scrutiny, regardless of production method. However, if AI outputs demonstrate transformative novelty, they should qualify as non-infringing derivatives. AI&#39;s culmination of data into something greater than the sum of parts parallels traditional practices like collage. Copyright law should evolve to handle AI&#39;s creative implications, not reflexively restrict it.<br/><br/>Commercial Needs<br/><br/>Generative AI has tremendous upside for industries like advertising and entertainment. But uncertainty around copyrights currently hinders adoption. Establishing clear protections and eligibility frameworks is essential so businesses can utilize these technologies at scale without prohibitive legal risks. Ambiguity privileges only those companies with resources to beg forgiveness rather than ask permission. For ethical Generative AI commercialization, updated codes providing transparency and security are crucial.<br/><br/>I appreciate the Copyright Office undertaking this complex issue. My hope is that measured policies will emerge upholding creative rights while allowing responsible innovation. I welcome any clarifying questions and look forward to seeing thoughtful solutions.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration,<br/><br/>Lori Pavese Mazor CEO &amp; Founder, SYNTHETIVITY
