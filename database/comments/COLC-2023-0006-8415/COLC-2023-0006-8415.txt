Unless and until generative AI programs are trained ethically and without exploitation, they are a hot mess. They need to dump those data sets (that are rife with ill-gotten art) and start over, using only art they&rsquo;ve been granted permission to use, or things from the public domain. Same goes for Chat GPT. Fair is fair.
