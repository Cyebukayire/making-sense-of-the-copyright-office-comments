There is no such thing as &ldquo;AI art&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s 100% theft, pure &amp; simple, being monetised by greedy non-creatives who want to bypass years of training &amp; practice. Nothing about it is creative, it&rsquo;s nothing but stealing the output of legitimate artists &amp; trying to claim rights on it and call it original. Horrifying. Insulting. Catastrophic. Appalling.
