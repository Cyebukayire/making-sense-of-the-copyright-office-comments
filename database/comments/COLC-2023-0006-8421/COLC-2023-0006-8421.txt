Aritficial Intelligence is harmful for artists and should be restricted or regulated because to power the AI to generate images, it must take from existing sources, that is, already copyrighted images from existing artists. Which is not fair, as the hard work of artists gets taken away to perform tasks so that inividuals can make and easy profit out of it. It has also brought unease among the artist community because it makes people question whether a piece is real or AI, which can damage the reputation of existing artists.
