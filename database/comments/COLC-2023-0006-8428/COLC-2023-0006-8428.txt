 I believe you shouldn&#39;t be able to copyright generated text at all because you&#39;re really just remixing the underlying training data. This is not a net new generated idea, rather it is a reorganization of existing language and ideas.<br/><br/>TRAINING an AI on a writer&#39;s (or artist&#39;s or actor&#39;s or musician&#39;s) work should be prohibited without full consultation, meaningful consent, and generous compensation via a negotiated, fully informed OPT IN license with the writer/artist themselves.
