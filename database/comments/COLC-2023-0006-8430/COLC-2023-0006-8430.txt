I am a full-time artist and author-illustrator of over a dozen children&#39;s books. On both the art and the book front, AI-generated content is already harming my ability to make a living. Online marketplaces are overrun with AI-generated content, thereby making it harder for consumers to find my work. From this perspective all AI-generated content fails the &#39;fair use&#39; doctrine, since AI-generated content is showing itself capable of replacing human-created content. Since all AI training-models are based on illegally-scraping copyrighted content, AI generated content is effectively plagiarism of the worst kind. AI-generated content should not only be denied any copyright protection, but should be required to be labeled as such, and prohibited from being used for for-profit enterprises. In other words, the companies that have created AI and that are now using AI, should not be allowed to profit from stealing the hard work of human creators.
