As a creator whose voice, face, photography, videography, and creative fiction are on the Internet, I have a vested interest in how generative AI companies train their models. Generative AI companies should be required to seek permission from individual creators and copyright holders on the use of copyrighted materials. Generative AI firms are profiting for free from the work of creators. Creators have a right too know when their world is used and to be appropriately compensated for their work when used to train AI models. No work that is not in public domain should be used for generative AI training unless the creator of that material had been compensated. Profiting on generative AI models is not fair use. Profiting on generative AI models without compensating creators is IP theft.
