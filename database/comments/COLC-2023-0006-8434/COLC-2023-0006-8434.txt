I do not believe that work that artists specifically created for one medium, should be allowed to be used to scrape and train AI. If I put my blood sweat and tears into a project or create something I own that image, music, performance, story. That was my work. I labored for that. To take that piece and train AI with that is not only a violation of copyright, but also has serious effects on replacing workers. This needs to be protected.
