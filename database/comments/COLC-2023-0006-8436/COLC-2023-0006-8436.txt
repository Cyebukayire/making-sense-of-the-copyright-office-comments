Generative AI is plagiarism.  That is all.  It scours the internet for things written, painted, photographed, drawn, created by humans, runs it through a blender, and spits it back out based on an algorithm on which things are most likely to be near the next thing.  Bit by bit, pixel by pixel, letter by letter, word by word.  It&#39;s all stolen from human artists.  All copyright protections will be lost unless the US Copyright office does something to stop this theft.  The rights to people&#39;s creative work should remain with the original artists, the rights to people&#39;s likenesses should be their own, tech companies should not be allowed to train generative AI on other peoples creativity and performances.
