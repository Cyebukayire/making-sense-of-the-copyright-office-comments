Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>My name is Michael Weber and I&#39;m a member of SAG-AFTRA.  I wanted to express my concern of the use of artificial intelligence in film and television.  There is the capability now for companies to use AI to create written works, like screenplays and teleplays.  This is pulling from human writers who have created successful works, but the original writers are not getting any compensation for AI use of their work to generate new work.  <br/><br/>There is also the capability to use artificial intelligence to use an existing image of any human and create a performance from it.  For example an actor could have given permission to have there image used for one day of work, but be forced to sign something saying that the studio has the right to reuse the image in perpetuity without further compensation to the actor.  <br/><br/>SAG-AFTRA and the WGA can make rules to prevent media companies they have a contract with from doing this, but we need national legislation to enforce or reinforce these agreements.  We also need protections for those who are not working under these contracts.  For instance non-union actors and writers in independent productions.  <br/><br/>We also need protections from media companies using images of the deceased without their permission.  It cannot be up to the family estate, unless the individual gave specific permission to oversee use of their image after the time of death.  <br/><br/>Outside of the entertainment industry, there is the use of fake accounts on social media and dating sites.  Peoples images are being used without their permission to create fake profiles on social media and dating sites.  We need federal legislation requiring all users of social media and dating sites to have their account verified with photo technology.  This will help curb anonymous bullying and misinformation campaigns on social media and prevent the online dating business from profiting of the use of fake accounts.  <br/><br/>We need protections for our image and work in all these forms of media.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Michael Weber<br/>Los Angeles, CA
