hello this is extremely important for young and pro artists alike the use of copyrighted works in Ai training or mimicking without permission is extremely troublesome and is usually used to get derivatives from the Ai that mimic the original and that is extremely bad for those whose livelihoods depend of their works . Ai can be a useful tool for all if regulated hope you have a good day. :)
