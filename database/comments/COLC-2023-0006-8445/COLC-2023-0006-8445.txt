To those not in the tech space it seems like this generative AI technology came out of nowhere. And for me and my community of artists, it did. We were not informed of our work being used to train these systems, nor were we asked. We weren&#39;t given the choice to allow or disallow our work to be used in this way. That is in no way ethical. <br/><br/>Not even by AI&#39;s own standards. I don&#39;t know much about the AI space, but if you go to IBM&#39;s website and look through the ethics page (https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-ethics) you&#39;ll see a section covering the Establishing Principles of AI ethics. There are 3. <br/><br/>1) Respect for Persons.  Respect the autonomy of all people and strive to ensure that those involved in the study or experiment are fully aware of the possible risks and benefits of said study. It also states that those involved can withdraw from the experiment at anytime.  <br/>Most of the artists and other creatives that make up the datasets were not asked to participate. Participation was forced upon us, with our knowledge or informed consent. <br/>And when we&#39;ve asks to have our work taken out of the training, we are told no or given false promises. <br/><br/>2) Beneficence. Do No Harm. <br/>Based of the healthcare system. And yet the current genAI systems have done and will continue to do exponential harm. The purpose of Copyright is to keep the power of ones brand and work in their own hands. It&#39;s extremely easy to create harmful images like the image I attached. As well as child pornography, and deep fake revenge porn. I don&#39;t want my work to be used to help create anything that facilitates these things.... Who would?<br/><br/>3) Justice. Who should reap the benefits of machine learning? <br/>This one deals with fairness. Surely it&#39;s fair for those who&#39;ve made these revolutionary systems to reap all the rewards. Right? Like completely uprooting and monopolizing entire industries. Even though the working class of those industries had no say in whether or not their labor was used to train a sleepless corporate system to compete directly against them.<br/><br/>  <br/>It&#39;s not fair. Workers have the right to the fruits of their labor. And if they want to aid in the development of these systems, it should be their CHOICE. I choose whether or not to donate blood, I choose whether or not to donate food, I should have the right to CHOOSE whether or not to donate my creative labor. <br/><br/>These systems need to be opt in only. Even by AI&#39;s own code of ethics, that they failed to live up to. <br/><br/>We created with the knowledge that Copyright would protect our works and our interests regarding those works. The current systems need to be disgorged and our copyrights need to be upheld. If these GenAI companies want to create a product using our work, they need to get proper licensing and permission.<br/><br/>Allowing them to persist as they are now sets a truly dangerous precedent going forward. Where AI researchers need not respect the wishes or well-being of (knowing or unknowing) study/experiment participants. AI is only going to get more and more impressive, we need to ensure that it is developed with rights of everyone respected. <br/><br/>That&#39;s the American way. Please protect the freedom of the working creative class. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking our comments into consideration.
