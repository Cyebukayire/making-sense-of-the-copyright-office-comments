Artificial intelligence as a whole has produced minimal progress in comparison to when it first started, it&rsquo;s now just significantly faster and just as prone to error as it always was. Generative AI utilizes a large collection of data that was scanned from the entire internet without permission from the vast majority of copyright holders nor regard to compensation post discovery of the materials illegally obtained use. Ai doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to infer whether a stroke from one painting or cluster of objects from a photograph had been place there with any intentionality by the artist or photographer. All AI does is assign values to price of data and the value that matches the assigned value of the text based input is added to the iterative output it generates. AI is a useful tool when utilizing a custom database purely of consenting contributors as it can help with rapid prototyping for quick thumbnails or for minute details such as the rough comic style lines around the characters in Sony&rsquo;s Marvel&rsquo;s Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse and Beyond the Spider-Verse. When the Artists are in complete control of the output and can reject the output when it doesn&rsquo;t work, that is when it can genuinely work.
