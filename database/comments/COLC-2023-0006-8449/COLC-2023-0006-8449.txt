Generative AI regulations need to take place immediately. Right now, these tools are infringing copyright and stealing jobs from artists all over the world. Since most companies are based on the US, regulations should start there so the world can follow.<br/><br/>The main concerns of artists right now are:<br/><br/>1 - regulation of AI training datasets: currently, most if not all known AI models use copyrighted arts and photos to train their algorithms without authorization or compensation. Any art or photo available on the internet will be scraped and used to train without consent from the creators of this images.<br/><br/>This leads to every art the AI produces being a copyright infringement at some level. Some AI models can even emulate an artist&rsquo;s style or art on demand. In other models, you can literally input an art from the artist you want and the AI will modify it as if it was &ldquo;new art&rdquo;. If this was done by an actual artist, it would absolute be considered copyright infringement. So when an AI does this, it shouldn&rsquo;t be different.<br/><br/>2 - Copyright protection for AI generated work: right now, courts in the US have been ruling AI generated work as unable to be copyrighted. This should be enforced and remain like this. Any work generated by an AI should be automatically considered &ldquo;open source&rdquo;, specially with the way AI is trained right now (referring back to topic #1)<br/><br/>If AI generated work CAN be copyrighted, this will give big companies and studios like Disney or Warner a easier time replacing actual artists, leaving a whole profession and category jobless, generating economic issues and lowering the general quality of entertainment content. Right now, copyright protection is a privilege of real artists and it should remain this way.<br/><br/>There are other topics of importance to be discussed as the technology evolves, but right now, the priority should be to protect the jobs, livelihood and intellectual property of artists, photographers, voice actors, writers, etc. We shouldn&rsquo;t let entire professions, talents and people go to waste because of corporate greed. <br/><br/>AI can be a great tool in many areas. There are nice AI projects to support disabled people (such as an AI navigator for the blind), as well as other AI projects in healthcare and other areas that are designed to facilitate life for people through technology. Generative AI is NOT that. It was made with the intent of substituting manual labor and lowering costs for big companies. Any copyright infringements from these AI models should not go unseen.<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention and care on this matter.
