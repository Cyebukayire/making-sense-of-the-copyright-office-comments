As a professional actor in SAG-AFTRA and citizen i believe it is imperative that ethical guidelines are placed on AI use in media. There are tremendous moral consequences of unregulated use of AI avatars not only from an integrity / deepfake point of view but also when it comes to protecting our labor force.
