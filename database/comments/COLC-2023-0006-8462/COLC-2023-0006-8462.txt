Is it as an actor I put a great amount of effort into auditioning and performing, and the idea that my likeness can be scanned, and used again, and again, without compensation, or approval, goes against everything that I believe in. The fact that the industry believes it would be OK to scan background people and pay them one time and never pay them again yet using their likeness in perpetuity is unacceptable.
