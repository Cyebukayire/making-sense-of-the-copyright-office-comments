I am a senior graphic designer (12+ yrs) with additional experience in illustration. The firm I work for is losing market share to AI and I have heard that this is also the case for our competitors (some of which have already begun cutting hours).<br/><br/>When market share that rightfully belongs to humans is lost to AI, wealth gets siphoned out of creative industries to tech companies. If left unregulated, a &#39;tragedy of the commons&#39; scenario is likely to ensue &mdash; granting copyright protection to AI would only hasten this outcome. This is where we are headed now (a simplified representation of the stages through which human art will eventually become devalued): <br/><br/>1.) AI augments human art and increases productivity, providing a competitive advantage.<br/><br/>2.) Excess of similar competition (businesses offering essentially the same products/services) leads to a saturated market -&gt; heightened barriers to entry, entry level jobs lost, reduced profit margins, difficulty gaining market share, dilution of brand identity and loss of customer loyalty -&gt; price wars begin.<br/><br/>3.) Supply exceeds demand leading to a flooded market. This causes a chain reaction: &lsquo;race to the bottom&rsquo; price wars -&gt; vicious cycle of devaluation -&gt; markets contract -&gt; creative industries begin collapsing -&gt; downstream businesses (which provide goods and services to the aforementioned) begin collapsing.<br/><br/>4.) The balance of labor and capital shifts to capital and workers lose bargaining power -&gt; human creative labor is disincentivized -&gt; brain drain and talent flight -&gt; depletion and barrenness of the commons.<br/><br/>Link to an academic paper &quot;AI Art and its Impact on Artists&quot;<br/><br/>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681<br/>
