I&#39;m someone who--to a tiny sliver of a percentage of the data set--has had my work impacted by ChatGPT, and probably other learning language models and machine learning applications. I write transformative work--fanfic!--and that means that my work is inherently transgressive and must be done free of profit, which it is. But ChatGPT and other LLM are not free of profit--they are building towards it, they want people to work with AI-generated written work in professional fields. I have a couple degrees in English and in looking for a job in my field, I keep running into job postings letting me know I will be working to edit and polish the work of an AI.<br/><br/>I find it economically abhorrent--as we are already seeing issues regarding voice actors and fake AI performances, the SAG strike and the fight they have against AI images being used and taking away future employment--and I see it in regards to writing, too. AI has been trained on the internet, and it has been trained--without my consent--on my non-profit work, but it aims to do that on a for-profit basis. <br/><br/>I find it abhorrent on a creative level. I find it dishonest. I have already met someone who said they used it on their final essays when graduating with their Bachelors of Science. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s outright plagiarism, but it is, in my view, unethical to apply to either a creative field or a scholarly one. It is unethical to use it for things that real human beings are being paid to do--and it&#39;s unethical to use others&#39; work as their data sets, without the ability to opt-out of these things. <br/><br/>There needs to be regulation. I don&#39;t doubt that this applied statistics--for it is not true intelligence, not yet--can be used for things that are beneficial, and which do not put real people, who are already struggling, further out of work. <br/><br/>And as I mentioned at the beginning--I write fanfic and I had a fair amount on AO3, which ChatGPT admitted to scraping in 2020. This was a blow to me and many others in the community. I personally felt very used and offended, and I still feel that way. My work is not particularly literary but neither was it ever meant for profit. It is meant for the community of people who are also crazy enough about whatever I&#39;m crazy about to go looking for stories outside of what the IP holders have given us. In my area of fandom, that is a golden rule--you don&#39;t charge for fanfic. AO3&#39;s entire non-profit model is based on that.<br/><br/>And as someone who decided to be a writer when she was nine years old, I&#39;m offended on a creative level. Creativity is a human drive, and I do not at all have sympathy for people who want to take a short-cut by grinding up other people&#39;s effort and hard-won skill and feeding it into a program to then claim the result as their own. That is offensive to anyone who has ever tried to write the beautiful poem and come up short, anyone who has started to draw and realized they didn&#39;t know enough about anatomy to make it look like the vision in their head--in short, anyone who has had the courage to fail and be mediocre. (And I have seen plenty of people crow about this, as well as people who assert that because something is on the internet, it is fair game for them to use as they like.)<br/><br/>AI--or rather machine learning--has potential. But as of this moment I believe the primary potential those who push for it want to put it towards is skipping past the artists and the people who demand that their skill and time be adequately compensated for, because you don&#39;t have to pay a machine nearly as much as you would have to pay a person, and that is just a vile use of the technology. It is anti-artist and it is anti-worker and it has been done in what I feel is a deeply unethical way.
