Hi, I&rsquo;m a performer and writer and I just want to let you know how critical it is that we put strong regulations around the use of AI. We must be able to own our own likenesses and voices &mdash; what else do we have? And we must ensure the copyrights of original material, created by people. Please listen to the people this affects &mdash; which is everyone. Protect our humanity. Creativity cannot be manufactured by machines.
