Please don&#39;t allow artificial intelligence systems to absorb copyrighted works without consent and compensation from authors and artists of copyrighted works.  It is completely unfair, and flies in the face of all that is right.  A.I. systems will take in all of this copyrighted work, blend it up, and spit out amalgamations of copyrighted work as if it were conceiving of it itself.  It&#39;s not creation.  It&#39;s absolute plagiarism.
