Artificial Intelligence is a tool for humans. I&rsquo;m and of itself the machines abilities should not be classified as IP or eligible for copyright from its creations. After all, the machine only learned to create after studying hundreds of thousands of hours of real people, or the creative and ingenious capacity of the human mind. Do not mistake AI for human creativity. It is nothing but an arm built on the foundations of other&rsquo;s creations that is now an amalgamation of images, words, and ideas built on the backs of human creativity after deciphering our creations which are original. AI is a copy. An impressive copy. But a copy of amalgamation nonetheless.
