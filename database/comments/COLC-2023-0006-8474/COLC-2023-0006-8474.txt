The threat of artificial intelligence is at this point something that could affect national security. Social media is the way in which most human beings communicate these days, and misinformation is spreading at a rapid rate. The societal impacts that this can have are exceedingly dangerous. Not to mention as people become replaced by artificial intelligence, and there are no jobs for the average worker, who will pay taxes? These corporations will make billions of dollars by cutting the cost of labor, and they already don&#39;t pay taxes. Where will the government get its money from? This is a huge issue that needs to be addressed, not to mention what will people do? Will there be universal basic income? We cannot survive as a country if we don&#39;t regulate artificial intelligence. As an actor our entire industry is on the verge of collapsing if artificial intelligence replaces life performers. There will be no need for sets, truck drivers, workers of any kind. The thousands of people that make tele or Film will no longer be needed. Animators, voice actors, All of our careers are on the line. We must have protections for our likeness, and have legal recourse to defend ourselves when our image is used against our will.
