If we don&rsquo;t put in the protections now, considering how quickly AI technology is moving on the daily, it will be too late to safeguard ourselves in the future. AI functions by learning from original material and then going from there. Just like when a tv show is playing the background of a scene in a film, permission has to be asked to the creator of that show and the performers need to get paid because their work is being used past the original context, such is the case here. If copywritten work is going to be used to train AI or used for AI to build off of then we need the original copyright owners to be asked if they would like to give their permission for their work to be used in every instance and if they agree than the copyright holder needs to be fairly compensated. It is highway robbery to think in any world it would be ok to take original work and profit off it it with the consent of the creator or them benefitting from their work being used. I urged to FCC to step up and do the right thing before it&rsquo;s too late. We need creative protections against AI asap! Thank you.
