I think we should use AI to replace out government officials instead of our artists and creatives.  Let&#39;s let an unbiased, infinitely more adaptable, and nearly omnipotent being make sound rational, logical decisions to govern us.  As a matter of fact,  AI will function better as a governing body, CEO replacement and impartial lawyer.  Let&#39;s let AI replace them first, see how they like being supplanted and unemployed.   It would be able to calculate and deduce the best possible methods, outcomes and decisions.  Who needs a CEO when an AI can calculate the global market trends, demographics, costs, stock market, and etc- in seconds.  Who needs an expensive lawyer when AI can remember every case and every rule since written record. Who needs a biased, crooked congress person when AI will make calculated, logical, and intelligent decisions... for free.<br/><br/>Also, is an actual person going to read this...? Or is it going to  be sifted through some sort of AI generated, filter and not one human who will vote on the usage of AI will read it?
