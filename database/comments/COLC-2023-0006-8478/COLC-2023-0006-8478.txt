Please protect artists - the human beings who have studied and practiced their art forms - from the uploading of their work for the purposes of training AI. All artists whose work has already been used this way against their will are owed compensation and apologies. Just because we can develop a technology doesn&rsquo;t mean we should - especially not without careful thought about the ramifications of human life and art. Making art for each other, seeking that connection with other human beings and what they can create, is what makes us human. Please address this by criminalizing and heavily punishing the theft and use of artists&rsquo; work without their consent for any purpose - including for the training of AI technology.
