Works produced using artificial Intelligence should never have the legal weight of copyright. <br/><br/>If AI works were to be given copyright, thousands of artists and craftspeople would lose their livelihoods in an instant and possibly their ability to support themselves as well. As demonstrated by the recent Hollywood strikes, the sudden loss of employment for a large sector of an industry has devastating consequences. Many artists have lost their homes and their savings. The influx of the newly unemployed to other sectors (retail, food service, gig employment) depresses wages for all and necessarily leaves some without jobs. The state has had to provide EBT to some, others have relied on grants and donations. As an unemployed writer, I am currently on EBT but I know that I will be employed sooner rather later because artists still have copyright.<br/><br/>If the constitutional justification for copyright is to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts,&quot; then AI copyrighted works would not only cause the unemployment of current artists, they would also prevent young people-- future artists and scientists-- from pursuing these professions. AI trained by the current adult generation would reproduce outdated modes of thinking, stifling progress. <br/><br/>An additional real-world concern, would be the potential glut of works presented to the copyright office for copyright. Works produced at the rate of thousands or hundreds of thousands per hour for the purpose of obtaining copyright could create an impossible situation in terms of assigning copyright to anything. This becomes even more likely given that these models are trained using similar data sets and algorithms and therefore would produce similar works. If copyright could be assigned, the looming threat of legal action for any human artist that creates a work similar to that already mass produced by AI would mean that those controlling copyright for potentially millions of works would own every new story, song, painting, and more.<br/><br/>1) Given the logistical nightmare, 2) the potential for bad actors to obtain large-scale copyright and to funnel the wealth derived from this copyright to a few (and impoverishing hundreds of thousands of workers in the process), and 3) the creation of empty, meaningless artistic and scientific works that cannot move society forward nor solve its most pressing challenges, it is immoral and must remain illegal for AI works to be awarded copyright and the protections that affords. Thank you.
