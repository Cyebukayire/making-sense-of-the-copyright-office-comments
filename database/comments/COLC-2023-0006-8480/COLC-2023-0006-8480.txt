As someone who has graduated from the art institute and has been around with people with various opinions, I learned that Ai should always be use less, not more, Gen ai is becoming a major problem, not just media but in the industry as well, Nobody wants to learn the hard way, those type of people want a crutch to make them feel better, they dont want to learn the traditional ways to graduate and work, they always want the easy way out, i would rather black listed them from ever using Gen ai because what tech &quot;bros&quot; people and what industry is doing, This is far worse than greed, its thief, and if they dont believe in reality, then they can accept their fantasy, I dont care whos political side you guys are on, But i would rather have this become more as an international problem, i would rather have Gen ai and ai be removed for good, their is no buts or if, This is just how it is, Gen ai isn&#39;t the way to solve thing, not even the industry, nor the economy, I as a USA citizen, stand for people that dont scrape, I want gen ai to be gone, for good
