AI is not intelligence, and it&#39;s not an artificial brain.  For example: ChatGPT replies are not conversations, they are depictions of what a machine things a conversation is, regurgitating words that mean nothing because it comes from nobody and nothing. AI is a facsimile of what a skilled, knowledgeable person will do because it gathers information from works made by other skilled, knowledgeable individuals, without citation, attribution, or credit, that is passed off as its own.  It just as I fear plagiarism is the least of our worries, though.<br/>AI learns from human content with all its biases and will generate content based on whatever information has been skimmed from human works without applying critical thought. Racism, dehumanisation, sexism and more will be regurgitated in the guise of a neutral intelligence with no humanity and therefore no human biases, even though that is the only thing it is made of.
