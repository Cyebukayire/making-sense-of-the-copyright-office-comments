Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m a composer, arranger, record producer, and recording musician. Records of my own or records I have produced, arranged, or performed on are out in the world in analog and digital formats. <br/><br/>&ldquo;AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Furthermore, there should be legislation that makes it mandatory that you be informed if your performances, or compositions, or arranging, or production are in line to be mined, be it via purchase (it could happen, he jokes), or via a streaming platform like YouTube or Spotify. Additionally, I&rsquo;d add legislation that the originator of artistic works have the absolute right to refuse said usage/mining, the equivalent of a Not For Mining Under Any Circumstances or Private Property, Trespassers Will Be Prosecuted sign. The writers strike was only possible, because certain structures were in place. Without similar structures, music people have no ground to stand on in an already criminally compromised economic state. The musician middle class has effectively been destroyed since the unchecked success of Napster over 20 years ago. AI may well be the nail in the coffin.<br/><br/>I would also like to assert that attention be paid to the origins and true biological purpose of music. For this endeavor, I would consult the work of Oliver Sacks, who demonstrated that music affects the memory center and language center of the brain. It is developmentally crucial to the human animal, and no doubt originally served a greater purpose than entertainment. (As did, I&#39;m sure, handwriting, in particular cursive, which is now universally being replaced by typing.) A true grasp of music&rsquo;s function would make it implicit that Legislation That Protects Human Music Creators, Protects Humanity. <br/><br/>Music has been culturally devalued to a vile degree, for something that is consumed daily and almost universally, and I believe that a redefinition of what it is is essential. Failing that, maybe a class action lawsuit against the United States copyright office or lawmakers who have stood by all these years as we have gradually lost our livelihoods, our educational programs, and our resources, is in order for their continuing to ignore the interests of performers, composers, arrangers, and production people, both fledgling and established. All, working Americans, and registered voters. If inaction is the ultimate end, we are left with no choice. It&rsquo;s been decades since Napster, perhaps our enemy isn&rsquo;t AI, but governmental contempt and complacency? Your actions from here on out will answer that question for a great many of us.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Adrian Romero<br/>New York, NY
