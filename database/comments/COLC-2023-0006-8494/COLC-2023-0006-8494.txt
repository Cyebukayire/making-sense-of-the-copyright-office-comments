I strongly support regulations on the development and operation of AI by national governments and the United Nations.<br/><br/>Technology companies and researchers leading AI development overemphasize and promote only the bright and good aspects of AI.However, in reality, even in the past year since AI began to spread, a number of troubles and problems have occurred that are difficult to fully grasp.<br/><br/>Those involved in AI development are not even showing any signs of solving these problems, and continue to run away from the responsibility that they should take.<br/><br/>Moreover, at the stage of developing AI, they do not receive prior permission or compensation from the rights holders, and they treat the rights and copyrighted works of others as if they were their own property. In ordinary commercial activities, paying permission and compensation to rights holders is commonplace, as if it were a law of nature, but those involved in AI development treat themselves as privileged.<br/><br/>Why is this kind of tyranny allowed??<br/>If such tyranny is allowed, it will not only affect works of art but also other intellectual property.<br/>That&#39;s very easy to imagine.<br/><br/>What if it were true that it is permissible to ignore the rights of others when training AI?<br/>By the same logic, technologically immature developing countries and authoritarian states can learn from developed countries&#39; technologies and patents through AI and use them free of charge.How can I stop it?<br/><br/>&quot;AI technology is comparable to nuclear weapons technology&quot; <br/>These words came from none other than AI developers and AI scientists.<br/>Why is technology that is as dangerous as nuclear weapons technology left unchecked in open source?<br/><br/>Below are answers to &quot;Questions&quot;<br/><br/>1) 2) I think generative AI is the destroyer of the concepts of copyright and creation.<br/>Already on the Internet and SNS, there are many questions about whether it is a creation by human hands or an AI product. It is full of posts that are difficult to distinguish with the untrained eye. This semi-forces human creators into asymmetrical practical troubles.<br/><br/>However, there are many scammers who post AI products pretending that they created them themselves.Human artists have never been needed Proof that &quot;I drew my own work&quot; is now required.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if copyright is granted to AI products,<br/>A large company with abundant computational resources for AI development will have AI generate all kinds of expressions in advance.<br/>It will also be possible to claim ownership of it. <br/><br/>4) 4) In Japan, we have enacted a copyright law that takes AI developers into consideration, but the results are terrible. Because the standards for rights infringement are ambiguous, the law is an excuse for abusing AI and infringing rights.United States should ignore Japan and refer to the EU&#39;s AI regulations that respect human rights.<br/><br/>9) Only an &quot;opt-in&quot; system is absolutely allowed.<br/>Why? Individual creators do not have the time or money to check every new AI-related service that is emerging around the world and request opt-outs. It&#39;s unrealistic.<br/><br/>9.5) If the transfer or rental is a contract based on AI, there would be no right to object. However, you should have the right to object if the transfer or rental is being done without taking AI development into account or cleverly concealing it. This should be a new right called the &quot;right to train AI&quot;, similar to the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;.<br/><br/>15) It should absolutely be disclosed. Currently, it is difficult to even know if you are being harmed by the secrecy of AI companies.<br/>There is no way to properly check.<br/><br/>18) Rights should accrue only to AI that is developed with respect for and without violating the rights of others.<br/>There are no currently popular generative AIs that have been developed in such a clean manner.<br/><br/>21) Is infringing on the rights of others &quot;useful progress&quot;? I believe that respecting others is progress. The answer is no.<br/><br/>25) AI developers have the heaviest responsibility. They continue to shift the blame onto users and distract from the problem.<br/>28) I feel like this important issue is being greatly downplayed and trivialized, as only works of art are currently being targeted. This is an act that destroys the foundation of trust between humans. Trust is the basis of all human society. It is nothing but a nightmare that fake productivity exceeds human productivity. Creating AI or replicas that pretend to be humans should be considered a serious crime.<br/><br/>30) Creating AI replicas without the consent or permission of the voice actors or actors themselves should be considered a serious crime.<br/>They make a living by selling their voice, acting, and face, which is their identity.<br/>but,there are already frequent incidents where people&#39;s voices and appearances are used for criminal propaganda and fraud. it is murder of the soul.<br/>&quot;Right to refuse learning to AI&quot; for all personal information is required.
