Regarding the rules for generative AI, what I place most importance on is whether the will of the original individual is respected.<br/>Therefore, we request that the following rules be followed.<br/>- Generated AI should only be created using data with the consent of the original author.<br/>・Generated AI should only be created using data with the consent of the original individual.<br/>・AI developers are obligated to notify in advance what the data will be used for when collecting data.<br/>・Make it possible to trace which data is used in the generated data and trace back to the source.<br/>- Make it possible to check the contents of the dataset later and remove it if necessary.<br/>- Prevent anyone other than the author from registering another person&#39;s copyrighted work. Violators must be punished.<br/>- Make it clear whether the product was created using AI. A good way to do this would be to have a watermark or a new image file format that cannot be converted, but what is required is something that would be easy for viewers to identify at a glance as an AI product.<br/>- When processing a product, there is an obligation to record the process and prove which parts were made by AI and which parts were made by humans. In some cases, a function to record the production process is required.<br/><br/>I hope that these are respected at the bare minimum, but what is necessary is to &quot;respect individual decision-making,&quot; and to do that, AI companies need to be trusted by the world, not only for their own interests, but also for others. I hope that you will make a sincere effort to respect others. Otherwise, I think there will be no healthy development of AI technology.<br/><br/>As a side note, I strongly dislike the fact that AI companies such as Stability AI and OpenAI took advantage of the flaws in Japan&#39;s laws to take away Japanese intellectual property, and I strongly dislike the fact that AI companies such as Stability AI and OpenAI have taken advantage of the deficiencies in Japan&#39;s laws to take away Japanese intellectual property. There is no trust whatsoever.<br/>I don&#39;t know what actions I should take in the future to make them trustworthy, but I have a strong sense of distrust that they are currently involved in creating global rules.<br/>It would be fine if their actions were aimed at &quot;respecting individual decision-making,&quot; but if they were acting only for their own benefit, this resentment would last forever.<br/>I hope it becomes a healthy rule.
