As a hobby, I am making a video game in Unreal Engine 5. I am a software engineer by trade. I have used AI to generate the sprite work (frames of animation for animating 2d assets in the game). But if I mention that in passing on social media, I get crucified by the public for &quot;being lazy&quot; and not hiring artists.<br/><br/>I&#39;m an amateur game dev who, in the past, has spent thousands of $ on artwork for mostly unfinished hobby games. Usually what prevents me from advancing my game into a product I could actually distribute is the limitations of what I can accomplish art-wise. My game design exceeds what I can accomplish with a limited art budget.<br/><br/>If I were an established industry person, obviously I would have a budget to spend on art contractors. But the popular opinion is wildly out of balance with reality. There&#39;s nothing &quot;lazy&quot; about AI art when it takes so much effort to generate it consistently for games currently. It&#39;s just saving me some time and money (because finding and managing good contractors is A LOT of both). You might think &quot;AI Art is taking jobs from US artists&quot;, but when I contracted artists I was forced into using online services that managed Indonesian, Chinese, Puerto Rican artists, etc. because American sprite artists are far too expensive for an independent hobby developer.<br/><br/>As far as copyrights go...even in the non-AI world, copyright law is toxic and designed to favor mega corporations. AI certainly helps no one in that respect, since mega corps are going to be the ones who can afford to monopolize AI and tell us average people cannot use it. But that doesn&#39;t make AI bad itself.
