AI Art needs to be regulated in the sense that copyright protection of training data should not vanish after generations.<br/><br/>Creating Art is a time intensive and creative process that is much harder than must people think. <br/>AI Art uses works of hundred of thousands of artists without asking them for permission nor financially compensate them for their work. Those companies then sit on a pile of stolen data and hide those files behind lawyers and call it company owned data.<br/><br/>If you watched all AI Image Generation Tools like Dalle, Midjourney etc in their early stages you could see tons of tons of watermarks, 1:1 copies and artists signings.<br/><br/>Nowadays they trained their networks to directly exclude such parts and also not to show 1:1 copies of source files, to evade classic copyright laws. Their arguments were that &quot;it doesnt produce copyright infringed works since its unique&quot;.<br/><br/>But the main issue is not about what it produces but about what it used as source material and the theft of intellectual property that happens.<br/>AIs are not much different from other computerprograms.<br/>In the end of the &quot;training&quot; you get a compiled file that has an extrem compressed neural network holding the weights from its training. I have like 20 on my pc. <br/>Most image networks use a diffuse reconstruction algorithm were they parse over millions of &quot;good looking&quot; files to create neural abstractions and groupings of the source data.<br/>The better the source data the better the output. If you train on ugly pictures you will get the ugly average of the trainingdata. So AI Image companies really need the good stuff or their pictures will look.. bad .. like when i drew it (im a tech person).<br/><br/>What does it mean? How should modern copyright laws define those copyrights? <br/><br/>In terms of AI pictures become their source code. Each picture holds unique heigher dimensional information encoded in 2d space. Its like a streetmap to navigate for an AI. And this needs to be copyright protected too. Training data and especially pictures should need AI licenses given by copyright holders to be allowed to be used as AI source code/trainingdata. There is more to a picture than our eyes can see and its so much more complex than most code libraries.<br/><br/>If i use copyright protected code in my work and my company releases that without respecting licenses im rightfully going to get problems.<br/>But in case of pictures that does not apply? <br/>So if i just compile someones stuff into a binary blob and then save it as a filetype of png. Can i now use anyones copyright protected code? Its now a picture.<br/>It just makes no sense to let AI companies ctrl + c everyones work and then act like we are talking about pictures painted by someone on a wall. Congratulations artists have become coders!<br/><br/>
