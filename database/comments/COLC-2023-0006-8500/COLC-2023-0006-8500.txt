Save copyright, save the economy.<br/><br/>That means not allowing AI generated or derived content to be copyrighted, and upholding the law with regards fair use, specifically that you cannot profit from others copyright without express permission, nor gain rights to their content.<br/><br/>&quot;Art&quot; is inherently human creation and fundamentally an act and artifact of communication. There is no connection or communication with an algorithm except that which is imagined by the human observer, therefore what AI produces is not art, just image and affectation.<br/><br/>The alternative to doing this would be anti-competitive, allowing a massive advantage towards the computational power only large corporations or the extremely wealthy can afford. Worse copyright itself would be untenable, undermined by not being upheld when the most egregious of abuses of law occur, a stick to keep people down. Meanwhile the copyright office even if augmented itself with AI wouldn&#39;t be able to keep up with sheer volume of content that very shortly AI and automated systems will generate.<br/><br/>Eliminating the profit from such endeavors would help reduce spam content, disinformation, copyright breach and protect jobs and thus the economy.
