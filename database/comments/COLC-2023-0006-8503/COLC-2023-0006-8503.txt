Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an on-going issue and it&#39;s in desperate need of regulation in several of areas. AI should not ever be protected by copyright under any circumstance, nor have the option to train on copyrighted works without licenses and proper compensation.<br/><br/>Starting with AI generated images, as these are the most problematic. AI Image Software are built upon theft, they collect copyright protected work for their software to train and later use to reach its outputs.<br/><br/>It threatens normal people&#39;s lives, and some huge industries, such as the Visual Arts, Animation, Photography, News industry, to list a few.<br/>Main Issues:<br/>- AI Images steals works and infringes on author&#39;s rights for exploitative purposes.<br/>- AI Images can be used to propagate fake news or enable blackmailing.<br/><br/>Proposed Solutions:<br/>- AI Images should always have clear and visible watermarks and metadata associated with it, alongside automatically posting to a site hosted and owned by the company behind the AI. To not cause confusion to anyone whom may see it.<br/>- AI Images should only be trained Public Domain. So all it produces legal and ethical results.<br/>- AI Images shouldn&#39;t ever include public figures or real people(Dead or Alive).<br/><br/>AI Voice Cloning is the second biggest issue when it comes to AI, as it affects everyone. AI voices can be used to deceive people, to include people in occasions or situations they did not agree or would not normally be in.<br/>Main Issues:<br/>- It takes someone&#39;s likeness and includes them in situations they never agreed or consented to.<br/><br/>Proposed Solutions:<br/>- Consider the proposed solutions in the &quot;No Fakes Act&quot; by SAG-AFTRA. See draft here: https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/no_fakes_act_draft_text.pdf<br/>- Consider the market strategy used by &quot;Vocaloid&quot;s, as they are highly comparable to AI voices, however, those were always agreed and consented by the voice behind such programs, and they receive royalties for such.<br/>- Companies should not be the ones providing AI voices. However people should be the ones providing AI voice work from their own voice, with specified contracts on what the voice should and should not be used.<br/><br/>AI generated text and stories are the third biggest problem, because much like AI generated imagery, AI generated text (and stories) are trained on copyrighted material and that same material is used during generation.<br/><br/>It threatens normal people&#39;s lives, and some huge industries, such as the Writing industry, Law industry, News industry, to list a few.<br/>Main Issues:<br/>- AI generated text steals works and infringes on author&#39;s rights for exploitative purposes.<br/><br/>Proposed Solutions:<br/>- AI generated text should be taken back to being spellcheckers. While fully generated text as it is today, should not be provided under any circumstance. As there&#39;s no true reliable way of identifying such.<br/><br/>Attached file includes the questions asked.
