Please take seriously the grave existential threat AI poses to humanity writ large. The scale of digestion and regurgitation of intellectual property that AI is capable of is unfathomable. Please do not trust big tech. They pride themselves on &quot;disrupting.&quot; Here what they seek to disrupt is our very humanity by absorbing &quot;date&quot; that is in fact the lifeblood of human existence and then spewing it forth without any empathetic understanding of what the weight of our existence actually means. It does this with no thought or concern for feelings, individual value, or the law. Our copyright laws are constantly being violated by its indiscriminate use of people&#39;s life work. The thought of hard work and dedication is meaningless to AI. To it, everything is either input or output. Please do all you can to protect us from this threat to life as we know it. Only through legal precedent can something of this magnitude be slowed. This isn&#39;t the printing press or the assembly line, this is the first steps in making human throught obsolete.
