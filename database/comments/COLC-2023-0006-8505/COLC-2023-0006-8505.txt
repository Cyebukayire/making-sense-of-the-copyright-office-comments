I am an artist, and I have been enabled.in my ability to do art through the transformative machanism that is Generative AI.<br/><br/>Generative AI is, fundamentally, like a camera, and the person operating the AI is essentially in the role of a photographer. Rather than positioning a body to take a picture of some object in classical space, they some numbers number and a set of ideas, and instead take a picture of an idea at some commensurate location in &quot;latent space&quot; as mapped by the generative AI.<br/><br/>Photography is unquestionably a form of art, and even a rank selfie or accidental shutter click counts, so long as that art is the product of selection and presentation with intent; this sums up the transformative act in the creation of copyrighted art in the form of a urinal on a pedestal, for example; it is not art in what it was, but rather becomes art in its selection and presentation with the intent of creating communication.<br/><br/>Likewise, were I not even to use AI, but rather slather a dog with paint, cover the floor with a canvas, and allow a laser pointer to swing around scribing lazy arcs for the dog to chase, I would be the artist even if I did not own the dog, nor the laser pointer, nor the ladder used to hang it, and rented the room. I would be the artist even if I sent someone else to set it up, and fetch for me the canvas for the same reason the director of a film is. Let us consider this piece titled &quot;A Dog at Play&quot;.<br/><br/>Even in such a situation wherein a dog has been trained to paint on a canvas whatever the dog may feel like painting, and wherein the dog paints a flower, while the dog&#39;s painting is certainly not my own (hereafter titled &quot;flower&quot; by dog) my recording of the dog painting that painting is a separate work despite the only aspect of my work for this third piece of art titled &quot;Another Dog At Play&quot; is that I put a video camera and a dog and paint in a room. I could make a collage of rebalanced images of the dog to render &quot;Flower&quot; and rebalanced images of &quot;flower&quot; to render the photograph of the dog. Again each of these are transformative despite being highly unoriginal of various other pieces in many regards, but in each case except &quot;flower&quot; I am unarguably the artist.<br/><br/>It is by this measure that I would like to commit the opinion that even the act of inputting a &quot;simple prompt&quot; and presenting the output is in fact &quot;transformative&quot;,.particularly in the execution of ANY use of inpaint or overpaint techniques.
