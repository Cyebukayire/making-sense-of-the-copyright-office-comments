Original work MUST be protected.  AI and copyright protections are a MUST because having original work copied without the creator&#39;s consent or even without giving credit to them is wrong. I can&#39;t imagine what it must feel like to have one&#39;s hard work taken in less than a snap of a finger and passed around without due credit and as if the work wasn&#39;t a labor of love.
