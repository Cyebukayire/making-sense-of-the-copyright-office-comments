AI is a rising technology that is being used to violate individual copyright, and do damage to individuals. Over the last year, as an artist, I&#39;ve felt nothing short of terror as I&#39;ve watched AI, both in writing and in art, take over my online feeds. There is no place now, or in the future, for these artificial machines that are trying to replace the human experience of creativity. There is no place in humanity for these robots.<br/><br/>It&#39;s been shown time and time again that AI tech takes from artists and writers, without permission, and subjects works to an artificial blender. This rising tech takes jobs in creative fields, and steals away from those who use their works to make enough supplementary income to keep themselves out of poverty. There is no accountability for the theft, and there is no compensation to artists who never consented to their works being taken. <br/><br/>I ask for, until AI can be done through ethical means (with the involvement of artists, people who are affected by this tech, not those who would gain from generative AI continuing unregulated), this technology needs to be stopped, and their data training sets wiped clean. If AI cannot be made without killing artists, it should not be used whatsoever, because humanity and human creative endeavors must be preserved.
