Since AI algorithms often rely on extensive data sets of existing artworks to create new pieces, there&#39;s a risk of unintentional or even deliberate copyright infringement. AI can inadvertently produce pieces that closely resemble existing copyrighted works, leading to legal disputes and undermining the rights of original artists. Moreover, the automated nature of AI art creation makes it difficult to attribute authorship accurately, making it challenging to protect the rights of creators and ensure that they receive fair compensation for their work. This blurred line of authorship can lead to a situation where AI-generated art effectively steals intellectual property from human artists, ultimately devaluing the efforts and creativity of the human artistic community.
