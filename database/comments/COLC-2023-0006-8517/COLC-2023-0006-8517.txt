As both an artist and a writer, I feel it is my duty to my community to comment here. AI is inherently theft, and cannot exist without theft. It is nothing but an effort to steal from creatives. I will, for the sake of brevity and clarity, use the rest of this comment to answer the listed General Questions. For other relevant reading, please see this paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681?s=031<br/>AI systems in their current form have been created through scraping data from the internet. This includes data from celebrities and politicians. You may have noticed a sudden rise in &quot;covers&quot; on Youtube featuring celebrities, cartoon characters, politicians, and even Youtubers themselves singing popular songs. While this is where things are at the moment, this will not always be the case. This could easily result in faked videos of high ranking politicians saying and doing things they would never. Already there are scams going around using the voices of politicians to sell products or scamming people using the voice of someone they trust. It is an entirely new level of deceit and disinformation.<br/>2. I have worked on and off as a freelance artist for years. I have seen artist&#39;s galleries be fed to AI in order to produce an image in their art style without compensating them. <br/>6. From what I understand, bots like Chat-GPT use data scraped across the internet. While I myself refrain from using AI because I feel it is morally bankrupt, I have seen anecdotes from fanfiction writers who entered a prompt of something they might like to read, and then found entire passages from their own works spat out at them. These scrapes happen indiscriminately and with no warning to the people whose work is being stolen, let alone talks of compensation. <br/>7. It is my understanding that when a page is &quot;scraped&quot;, all the sentences on it are saved. They&#39;re cataloged within a database with tags including word order and the nature of the sentences surrounding them, as well as other associated words. When the AI receives a prompt, it then searches through it&#39;s catalog for sentences and word orders with terms relating to the prompt, and arranges them in an order approximating the original pages they were copied from. This is why the term &quot;generative AI&quot; is inaccurate in my opinion. It&#39;s essentially an advanced search engine arranging results to meet a prompt. It does not create anything new or transform the works it takes from in a meaningful way.<br/>8. The unauthorized use of copyrighted works in AI models can never be fair use, because AI cannot transform a work on its own. If it is used for noncommercial purposes, such as research or personal entertainment, that is one thing. It is still dangerous, and I believe still theft. However, the moment AI &quot;works&quot; begin to be used to make any kind of money they should instantly lose any protections they may otherwise have. <br/>9. Not only should copyright owners have to opt in to their works being used to train AI, companies should have no foothold to pressure copyright holders into saying yes if they don&#39;t want to. It is absurd to expect every up and coming creative or copyright owner to know all there is to know about AI and the risks that may come with it. I won&#39;t say it shouldn&#39;t be an option (although I don&#39;t know why anyone would want to) but it should always be a conscious choice.<br/>15. AI developers should disclose all records of the data they have collected and remove all data relating to certain sources if requested. If they don&#39;t comply they should be held criminally liable.<br/>18. If you commission an artist to create a portrait, do you then claim you&#39;re a master painter when you get the finished product? Prompting an AI to create something is no more creating a work than ordering a pizza constitutes making it. Asking for something is not creation, even if one has to think about their words while asking. The AI is always the author. <br/>21. AI is a disruptive and destructive force to the arts. It is not progress and it is not a way forward. &quot;Plagiarism, except it&#39;s very fast&quot; is not an advancement to be protected.<br/>25. If an AI generated material infringes on an existing work, the developers of the model allowing it to do so should be held liable, as well as the person attempting to profit off of their prompt. <br/>28. In all context, AI generated material should be clearly labeled or identified, with no exceptions.<br/>31. Congress should establish that all AI generated material created without the express permission of all copyright holders whose properties are used in data are infringement in themselves, as well as unable to be copyrighted since it is not a human-made creation.
