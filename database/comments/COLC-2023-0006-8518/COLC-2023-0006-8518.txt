The use of AI is often relegated to percentage of creation. Did the human interaction include the vast majority of the creative capacity or did the computer create the vast majority of the creative capacity. While one can compare the use of a typewriter or computer as a tool to create something, using these tools still involve the bulk of human capacity to create something new. A paint brush is a tool, but the tool must still be moved by hand. The typewriter is a tool, but requires the creator to still tap the keys by hand. The computer is a tool, but still required input by the person behind the tool (except in cases of limited human capacity of movement such as a physical handicap). AI, on the other hand, starts with the input of an idea and by US Copyright law, an idea cannot be copyrighted. To get that idea from thought to actual creation requires limited input by a human. A human will write prompts, but prompts are written ideas. The machine, the computer is what actually conveys the written ideas into a completed creation.<br/><br/>As an author or illustrator. I can now write all kinds of thoughts and notes about a book, Art, illustration, or music idea on a sheet of paper or into a digital file and my notes do not create the completed work so my notes would forever remain uncopyrightable, but why would they be less valuable than an AI prompt? Simply because the AI prompt managed to create something from those written ideas? Does that mean they deserve more protection than my written ideas that are not used as an AI prompt because I want to create an idea to completion with my own knowledge, skills, and individual capacity?<br/><br/>AI certainly can have a lot of uses for people and business, but when it comes to copyright protection, maybe the copyright protection can extend to the specific prompts, but if prompts are simply the written form of a creative concept, an idea, then I hardly see how they can be copyrighted when ideas, by copyright law, cannot be copyrighted.<br/><br/>AI prompts are written notes of ideas, sometimes strewn together, but nevertheless, I believe they are simply written notes of ideas. The computer, not the person, conveys those ideas into a creation.<br/><br/>What if a person uses AI to create a storyboard? Are storyboards, visual ideas copyrightable?<br/><br/>What about the person who jams tons of AI prompts into a computer or has them computer generated so they can create tons of creative works to be used to sue any human creator who has any near resemblance to one of those thousands of creations. Pretty soon that type of activity will clog court systems by people focused on making money off human creators and thereby causing more abd more human creators to shy away from creating anything at all. If that occurs it will collapse ann entire human ecosystem.<br/><br/>Some people already believe and fear AI will collapse the creative ecosystem of writers, artists, illustrators, photographers,  musicians, songwriters, etc&hellip; <br/><br/>As a member in a social media group I get to experience both sides, the excitement of the author who cannot afford illustrations and the illustrators and authors concerned AI will render them unnecessary. In addition to those individuals are all the other support personnel or creative support suppliers who have jobs or businesses dependent upon creative ecosystems.<br/><br/>Will AI become the catalyst to destroy these creative ecosystems that exist today? No one knows that for sure, but most automation over time has changed job needs and skills required for any jobs that remain in the wake. The ones who often get hurt worst in such cases are those with limited access to education and training, plus those with limited resources or those who are challenged to fit in a more restrictive and orderly society where machines continue to be more relied upon for everything.<br/><br/>For creative talent to be copyrightable, it would seem the machines should remain a tool with limited percentage of the work effort to create something rather than allowing human creative talent to be taken over. So, I end where I began. How much percentage should a machine be allowed to create something on its own to be copyrightable, except where necessary to support someone with physical limitations?<br/><br/>AI prompts are ideas in written form put into a machine for the machine to do the actual creative process. Should AI prompts be copyrighted when other ideas cannot be? Especially when the machine has to pull from other human creations for learning to make a new creative piece?<br/><br/>As I mentioned, I believe AI has some space due it to exist, but not in the copyright space where the machine rather than the human dies the actual creation of a human idea. I repeat, ideas by copyright law are not copyrightable and I believe AI prompts are written ideas that a machine rather than a human uses to create something new, a new creative piece maybe, but machine created all the same.<br/><br/>Can everyone else&rsquo;s ideas not made into AI prompts be copyright protected?<br/><br/>
