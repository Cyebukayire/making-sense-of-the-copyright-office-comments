Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>Dear Members of the U.S. Copyright Office:<br/><br/>I am Chip Johannessen, a television writer and Producer whose credits include X-Files, 24, Dexter and Homeland.  I thank you for examining the issue of copyright as it relates to AI generated material. The judicious and fair application of copyright laws is essential to the survival of my industry and the ability of all artists not only to make a living, but to contribute new and novel work in an age of increasing AI usage.  There are two key issues, I&#39;d like you to consider.<br/><br/>First, I believe your initial findings were correct:  the way generative AI works is fundamentally different than the creativity behind human authored work. As a professional writer I do not think the process of generating &quot;material&quot; through &quot;prompts&quot; exhibits anything like the control associated with human authorship, especially when it comes to AI-generated text. Thus, I urge you to set an extraordinarily high bar for the level of human input necessary for a work to be eligible for copyright. In fact, I would urge you to decide that no AI-generated material can be eligible for copyright.  This is especially true given that the essential functioning of LLMs and image and music generators is a form of plagiarism.  Fundamentally, these systems do not generate new ideas or transformative work: instead, they remix their training data in a stochastic manner that is the opposite of the intentional human creative process.  Human artists create with a point of view that reflects not only the sources of their inspiration, but their personal experience and knowledge and the meaning they wish to convey.<br/><br/>The second issue regards training data itself. AI systems can only output material that is derived from their training data. However, the companies building these models have made no attempt to license the copyright protected material in their training data sets. All AI developers should be required to license the material in their training data only with the informed consent, meaningful consultation and generous compensation (the &ldquo;three C&rsquo;s&rdquo;) of the creators of the underlying works. Further, this should happen only with Opt In licenses. Opt Out licenses offer no functional protections to authors, artists, musicians and anyone whose intellectual property is violated by these machines. <br/><br/>While I am not opposed to new technology, I think the AI systems currently being deployed were assembled without regard to the letter, spirit, or intention of hundreds of years of US copyright law -- law that has allowed our country to be an intellectual beacon to the world. To change or distort copyright law to protect the developers of AI systems would undermine the entire aim of copyright. It would effectively put not only an artist&#39;s work -- but their very identity -- forcibly into the public domain without consideration to their wishes or livelihoods. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and I hope you realize your decisions will have profound ramifications for the field of human art and creativity.  <br/><br/>Yours,<br/>George F. &ldquo;Chip&rdquo; Johannessen<br/>chipjoh@msn.com<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Chip Johannessen<br/>Pacific Palisades, CA
