Artificial Intelligence of any kind needs regulation.  SERIOUS regulation.  I am a screenwriter.  My credits include THOR RAGNAROK, BLACK WIDOW, GODZILLA VS. KONG, and AGENT CARTER.  If any of my copyrighted work is fed into an AI program, and that program in turn uses my work to learn to be funnier, or scarier, or more poignant, or more heartwarming, or more ironic, or whatever, then that program is profiting off my work without proper compensation or acknowledgement.  This goes for any screenwriter, TV writer, novelist, playwright, poet, or artist of any kind.  These programs only succeed by referencing existing work, and the creators of that existing work have rights.  Therefore copyrighted material SHOULD NOT be used to train generative AI.  We need strict and clear guidelines to protect the artists of this world before these unnecessary computer programs create a full-on plagiarism for profit business model.
