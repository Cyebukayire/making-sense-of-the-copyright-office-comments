Please consider protecting us, the actors and writers. I am a background (Extra) I work enough to qualify for health and pension. If AI is to take my image and place me in crowd scenes, restaurants, offices, as a pedestrian, in an airplane, I will never be hired again!! I love my career and want to keep working! I don&rsquo;t want my image being used whenever and wherever some studio exec feels like placing me in a scene
