I believe that it is time to reflect once again that the foundation of the idea of human rights lies in human reason (and its scientific verification) and free will.<br/>The ability of scientific verification and the freedom of the will to explore religion have criticized the old social system and the authoritative interpretations that oppressed many. This has become the human rights philosophy of our time, which reveals the dignity of every individual to be preserved and the room for mutual respect.<br/>This issue should be regarded as a serious crisis in the sharing of human rights principles.<br/><br/>Generative AI (henceforth &quot;GAI&quot;) is a synthetic processing of training data. It does not produce new creations or scientifically verified views.<br/>Training data is the transformation of copyrighted works into statistical information without changing the nature of the content.<br/>The GAI, which aligns words, lines, colors, music, sounds, and other elements, produces output that appears to follow instructions or questions by focusing on statistical information.<br/>It is taking advantage of people&#39;s cognitive abilities in reverse.<br/><br/>Blind faith in GAI technology is equivalent to taking &quot;Hammer of Witches&quot; for granted.<br/>The theory that &quot;machine learning is the same as human learning&quot; is begging the question.<br/>It is the driving force behind undeterred exploitation and dehumanization, and is the cause of strikes in the film industry and movements in various industries. I-1,2,3<br/><br/>The Copyright Office&#39;s response to I-4 through II-9,17,20,22, etc. is appropriate.<br/><br/>Regarding III. Firm stance, but urgent action on copyright laundering is needed because commercial use and data collection by GAI companies are unchecked.<br/><br/>Regarding IV.<br/>Unauthorized secondary use of copyrighted material. The output is data that has been modified and processed from existing copyrighted works.<br/>Simple understanding needs to be shared.<br/><br/>Answer to VI.<br/><br/>1, 2 Causes serious confusion in the understanding of human rights principles.<br/>It fosters prejudice against isolated language texts.<br/>Fosters distrust of creative works worldwide, and hurts the appeal between different cultures and the demand for their works. Profits are taken by the GAI companies or the state that promotes them.<br/><br/>5 Learning data should also be subject to copyright protection held by the author of the original work.<br/>Prohibit the conversion of GAI output into relearning data. (Prevention of copyright laundering)<br/>Establish a licensing system for learning data creation businesses.<br/>Provisional suspension of GAI development and use or publication. (Learning data is loaded)<br/><br/>Learning data without proof of copyright origin will not be used for GAI, as was the case with Napster.<br/><br/>20 Outputs are modifications of existing works. Priority should be given to sorting out the current problems.<br/><br/>22 Output is fraudulently provided as something that meets the demand for various works. Free-riding of author&#39;s rights and culture.<br/><br/>23 The decision should be based on whether the data is derived from an existing work.<br/><br/>24 Request for disclosure of developer&#39;s communication records.<br/>(Can a strong disclosure request be made by reporting to the Copyright Office or in cooperation with consumer interest groups, etc.?)<br/><br/>27 Policy makers should share that GAI undermines the credibility of information on which political decisions are based, temporarily distance themselves from partisanship and support groups, and take a stance of confirming human rights and democratic principles.<br/><br/>28-1,2,3 Developers and GAI users. There are no technical barriers to attaching stamps or text. Inappropriate behavior regarding labels should be punishable.<br/><br/>29 With the advent of high-performance CPUs, the future is near where output that cannot be verified by human perception will be created. One of the limitations is the appearance of data that cannot be considered the target of detection tools.<br/>There could be evasion of the law by, for example, having low-wage workers create works of authorship.<br/><br/>32 There is no such thing.Unethical attitudes of developers should be pursued.<br/><br/>33 Rights especially for sound should be considered. It should be considered in conjunction with copyrights for works converted into learning data.<br/><br/>34 GAI can be used for political and war propaganda. When offensive use is confirmed, there will be increased calls to create loopholes in GAI regulations for countermeasures and counterattacks. Before that happens, we need to address the issue within the scope of copyright.<br/><br/>After the Reformation of the 16th century, the idea of cultural maturity and tolerance was frustrated and the beginning of a chain of wars that continues to the present day.<br/>I would like to confirm to you that this was triggered by the creation of anonymous propaganda pamphlets that exploited letterpress printing and unauthorized translations.<br/>It is fair to say that the philosophy of copyright is a crystallization of people&#39;s regrets from that time to the present.<br/>
