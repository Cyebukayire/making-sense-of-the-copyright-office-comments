While I am excited about the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help humankind take the next step forward in our inevitable march of progress, I fear the potential for serious abuse this technology holds. We already have AI impersonating artists and the human voice to such a degree that shocking imitations can be achieved with minimal effort. I worry about the effects this will have on copyright. We need to define AI&#39;s role in copyright and create clear regulations which prohibit a &quot;Wild West&quot; like spread of lawlessness which I fear will be similar to the early days of filesharing.
