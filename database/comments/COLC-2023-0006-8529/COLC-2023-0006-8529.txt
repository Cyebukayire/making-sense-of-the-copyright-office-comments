My Name is Shaina Greene I&rsquo;m a resident in florida and I do not advocate AI. It&rsquo;s heading in a dangerous direction that&rsquo;s already being used for nefarious purposes. Ai has been used to scam innocent people out of their hard earned money by not only voice cloning, but deep fakes and Ai photo generators.<br/>The technology has gotten so advanced you only need 1 photo of a victim to generate thousands of fake images, or less than 30 seconds of a voice recording to clone the voice and trick a family member into thinking they&rsquo;re being held hostage, when in reality the victim is at home none the wiser. <br/>There should be severe regulation when it comes to Ai when it comes to human lives, including in the creative community.<br/>As an artist, I understand that art (art, music, writing, etc) is expression of a very deep complex spectrum of feelings that machines just don&rsquo;t have. Art is a livelihood for millions of people and to have it be easily replicated by a program that, also, takes images and illustrations from anyone to build a new image. That&rsquo;s not art. <br/><br/>There&rsquo;s a lot more happening with Ai than we realise, improved programs, experiments, or maybe even illegal operations. As I said, the path that Ai is going down is a rotten one that&rsquo;s only going to degrade the further we go. We the people need to work together, talk like adults, and figure out what the best course of action needs to be.<br/><br/>Please stop the use of Ai and help us figure out a way that it can be used to benefit people instead of harming and causing distractions from real issues.<br/>Thank you
