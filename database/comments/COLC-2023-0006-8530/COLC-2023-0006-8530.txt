&quot;Japan has become a machine learning paradise&quot;<br/>Yann LeCun&#39;s statement.<br/>This is because the Japanese government at the time did not explain the copyright risks of AI when discussing legal revisions, and instead created the most lenient legal framework in developed countries.<br/>Regarding the provisions of the Copyright Act that allow AI to &quot;learn&quot; copyrighted works such as texts and images almost unconditionally, the Japanese government did not sufficiently explain to rights holders the possibility of copyright infringement by AI at the time of the law revision. Discussions in government councils have been based on the premise of developing high-performance technologies such as next-generation AI, but this was forced forward without explaining to rights holders the existence of risks.<br/><br/>In the UK, we will hold talks with media organizations such as the BBC, news agencies, and news outlets, and hear from people who have actually been harmed by generated AI at public hearings in the US.<br/>However, in Japan, the people who are actually harmed by the creation of artificial intelligence are not invited. Conferences are held where people who want to promote AI in companies gather, but the opinions of intellectual property rights holders who are the subject of learning are often ignored or intentionally not mentioned.<br/>Only beginner and intermediate illustrators are against generative AI, and famous manga artists say they are not against generative AI.<br/><br/>The priority is only on utilizing AI without clearly presenting specific return methods or regulatory proposals.<br/>He even says he will offer corporate tax breaks to development companies with ties to government AI-related teams.<br/>We believe that unauthorized use of copyrighted materials for generation AI is strongly associated with unfair competition.<br/><br/>Users of generative AI   launder copyrights in a variety of ways, and the more generative AI becomes popular, the more those who produce primary data will lose money, and the world will become a place where society will be harmed. <br/><br/>Originally, copyright law was created to protect copyright holders from abuses such as copying made easier by printing technology and counterfeits appearing on the market.<br/>In reality, a huge amount of AI products are in circulation, causing unfair copying and harming the interests of rights holders.<br/>Generating AI apps that use fraudulent data are being sold in app stores.<br/>This is a company that sells illustrations that closely resemble the copyright holder&#39;s work as if they were dress-up items, and is clearly using the data without the permission of the author, but hides learning information and is ethically unacceptable.<br/>They are released in large quantities onto the market and are treated as disposable, clearly harming rights holders.<br/><br/>Current AI developers and companies are hiding this issue, and we urge disclosure and transparency of learning data, as well as intervention and regulation from an impartial international organization.<br/>Additionally, there are many cases where current laws cannot address AI damage.<br/><br/>October 29th. Some AI-related people have expressed terrible opinions regarding copyright on social media.<br/>・Humans and AI learn in the same way, and humans also plagiarize.<br/>・Copyright is only the lowest level of rights and is not a very strong right.<br/>・he says. People who are not celebrities claim and protest copyright infringement.<br/>This is similar to what Shinji Aoba did in the Kyoto Animation arson incident: ``I started the fire because it was stolen!&#39;&#39;<br/><br/>Even now, many painters are victims of human rights violations.<br/>Copyright is a human right and a fortress that protects identity.<br/>I would like to request international regulations and penalties.<br/>
