There should be serious thoughts put into this topic and our voices should really be heard. I work as a small time voice artist with both singing and acting roles on the internet. For me this is a small side gig that is able to get me a small amount of cash to help the bills go down smoother, but for others it is their entire income. When AI comes along and threatens to use our voices to train and build models and banks, if we are not given the ability to give or withold consent, it puts our livelihoods at stake. Consider if you could have your identity taken away from you without compensation or consent, and someone could make you say anything they wanted, or to have a character you voice say something that you did not say, it&#39;s a scary thought. Please truly consider the ramifications that this might have. Insure that we as actors get to keep ownership over our field, our personality, &amp; our voice by not allowing AI to be trained with and by our voices without our permission. Thank you for your time.
