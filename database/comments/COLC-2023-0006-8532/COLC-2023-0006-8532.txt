I have been a working writer of fiction and screenplays for my entire adult life.  I have managed to support a family on the income produced by this creative work, a circumstance for which I am extremely grateful.  It&#39;s already hard enough to carve out such a life in this country -- but it will become impossible if the Copyright Office fails to protect the rights of artists from emerging forms of artificial intelligence.  In particular, the Copyright Office cannot allow generative AI programs to continue being trained on the work of human writers without the consent of those writers.  It&#39;s absurd and outrageous to suggest that such outright theft should be considered &quot;fair use.&quot;  When an AI is allowed to scrape my life&#39;s work and piggyback on the skills I&#39;ve spent my entire life building, those skills are radically devalued and I&#39;m placed in the ridiculous position of competing against an algorithmic version of myself in the marketplace.  Such a situation threatens the existence of writing not just as a profession, but by extension as a craft.  It&#39;s already a reality for some of my peers, who are competing against AI imitations of themselves on Amazon, and the rest of us will be in some version of the same situation very soon if the Copyright Office doesn&#39;t take action.  In Hollywood, my union, the Writers&#39; Guild of America, recently won a groundbreaking contract that includes protections against the most pernicious uses of AI.  But we had to strike for 148 days to get that contract, and only the Hollywood studios are subject to it: the tech companies on the cutting edge of AI development are not.  And only the fortunate few of us working in Hollywood have the market power and union strength to win any sort of protection at all.  For the vast majority of writers working independently on prose, poetry, drama, or anything else, the only hope for redress lies with the federal government.  The stakes could not be any higher, and we&#39;re not going to get a second chance at this.  If we don&#39;t act now to stop the theft of creative work for the purposes of building AI, that theft will become the basis of the so-called creative economy in this country -- the practice will become entrenched, and it will be impossible to be the genie back in the bottle.  So please, as someone whose life has been defined by the practice of writing, and by reading and watching the work of other writers, I&#39;m asking the Copyright Office to make a stand right now, so that future generations will have the same opportunities I&#39;ve had.
