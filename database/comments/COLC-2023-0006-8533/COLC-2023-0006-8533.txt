AI art is an amaxing took for letting both skilled artists and aspiring artists make their visions come to life.<br/><br/>I think there are two issues at play with copyright. <br/><br/>1. You havent defined clearly what the amount of manual changes to a picture make them copyright eligible. You have also not clearly enough defined why an image formed with various processes and prompts are not eligible for copyright.<br/><br/>2. A decision needs to be made how the usage of copyrighted images were  and will be used. As the images cannot ve reproduced by asking an AI to produce the work asked for, i dont think that the original artists should be able to file things like DMCAs for models. I do believe that a copyright holder should have the option to opt their images out of training models
