Most algorithms for artificially generated media as it currently stands use data from creative work, artwork and vocal performances, without the knowledge or consent of artists and actors. The training and creation of these tools must be regulated so that artists whose work is used to make them are properly compensated (as is the case for text to speech programs or vocal synths such as Vocaloid)
