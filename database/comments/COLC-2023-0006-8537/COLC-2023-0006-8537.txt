The rapid advancement of generative visual and musical AI is fundamentally altering the landscape for individuals considering careers in art and craftsmanship. While these AI technologies offer exciting possibilities, they pose a significant threat to the traditional incentives associated with these creative fields. They risk undermining the value of dedication, artistic mastery, and merit by enabling swift replication of innovative styles and compositions. In this evolving landscape, it is essential to acknowledge that AI, rather than being just a tool, has the potential to sideline human creativity and skill, fundamentally reshaping the way we approach and value artistry.
