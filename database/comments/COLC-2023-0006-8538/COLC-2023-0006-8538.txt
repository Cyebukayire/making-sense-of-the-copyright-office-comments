As someone who works within the creative industry, the use of AI has been detrimental to my and my colleagues&#39; careers. There have been many instances where my art have been put through AI programs and used as a style to replicate without my consent, violating my terms of service. During a time where business has been more difficult, this actively harms my career. And many friends and acquaintances have been affected by this even more, to the point that some jobs have been endangered from the abuse of AI. <br/><br/>Not only that, but since the rise of AI, work has become a lot more difficult to find. Many developers, producers and project leads have turned to AI for art, repeatedly taking away jobs for real human artists. What doesn&#39;t help is that many programs that are accessible to the public use many art pieces from so many artists without any consent or compensation, so those who sell the AI art have been stealing work and finances from artists who use their art to live and work. <br/><br/>I and many other creatives are begging for heavy regulations regarding AI art and programs so that our livelihoods are not at risk for the sake of those who endanger our livelihoods.
