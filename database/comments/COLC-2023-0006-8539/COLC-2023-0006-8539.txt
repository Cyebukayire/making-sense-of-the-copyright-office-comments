Just yesterday I was made aware that a youtuber made an AI version of my voice (as well as a few co-workers of mine), without my permission, and made a video using that AI. They even credited us. This was a violation of my art at a voice actor and vocalist, and as technology grows these tools will only become more accurate, taking away work from me and other performers. If my voice is to be used as an AI, I expect to be asked, permit it, be credited and paid a premium for its use.
