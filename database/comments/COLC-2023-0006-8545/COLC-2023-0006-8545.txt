Unfortunately, though we could know the contributing material which AI generative models employ to create a work, that information is not currently made available.  This means that the true collaborators and creators are anonymous.  This renders current AI art undserving of copyright protection.<br/><br/>Also the purpose of IP is to encourage the creation of work by providing creators with an incentive to make the necessary sacrafices, both financial and personal, to do so.  AI &quot;art&quot; regurgitates the work painstakingly created by artists in an anonymized blend at nearly no cost.  <br/><br/>The queation should be asked:  how does society benefit from offering AI it&#39;s copyright protection?<br/><br/>I do not see that it does.
