AI-generated content (images, audio, text, video, etc.) should not be given copyright protection.<br/> <br/>Generative AI is already destructive to current creative industries. The proliferation of AI-generated content has led to an over-saturation in creative fields, especially in the freelance space. I have personally seen a massive drop in the amount of leads I can generate selling art commissions over the last year (my freelance revenue is around 20-30% of what it used to be). The rate at which content can be generated with AI also leads to a flooding of &#39;sludge content&#39; in online creative marketplaces. This makes it difficult for artists and clients to find each other, while also skewing the expectations of prices for human-made creative services. This has created a race to the bottom in creative fields.<br/><br/>This race to the bottom has decimated entry level positions in creative fields. In the field of freelancing, beginning artists have previously sought to build a client base and an online following through inexpensive commissions from fans and other creatives. This gives beginner artists the capacity and the incentive to continue improving their artistic skill while also building business confidence among potential clients. However, with the advent of generative AI, this has led to a drying up of these beginner-friendly commissions, effectively closing the door on beginner artists who wish to develop their skills and their style. AI incentivizes them to compete in terms of volume rather than quality, working with the creative limitations of generative AI. AI takes away the incentive to develop artistic skills and a unique personal style of artistic expression in favor of cheap regurgitated sludge.<br/><br/>Unregulated AI will lead to a dearth of original expression in the creative industries, the long-term consequences of which could lead to the wholesale destruction of creative industries. This will lead to an overall drop in the quality of movies, songs, tv shows, art, video games, and other media. Without talented human creatives incentivized to develop and improve media as a profession, the development of culture as whole will stagnate.<br/><br/>Copyright law must remain true to its mission of protecting human creatives. Art, music, film, literature, and culture as a whole are what shape human society. Human creatives must remain at the helm of cultural development, not black box machine learning algorithms. Therefore, copyright ownership should remain strictly at the hands of human creatives, and copyright protection should only apply to human-made art.
