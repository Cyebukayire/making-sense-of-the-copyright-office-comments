I am asking U.S. Copyright Office to consider that AI-developers have used to their own gain and profit datasets that contain a huge amount of intellectual property of artists from countries all over the world. They have done so without asking permission, without credit and without obtaining licenses. Text-to-image AI models let users prompt the names of known living artists and generate images in their style. These outputs are flawed and inadequate and can already be found all over the internet next to original works of the prompted artists, often even sold using their name. All this devalues original work and discredits creatives who want to maintain their artistic integrity and decide how their name and works are used. The output of AI-models competes directly in the art market against the artists whose works were used to train text-to-image models. The AI output is very cheap and the main revenue goes to the pockets of tech companies who collect a monthly fee for their products. If tech companies are allowed to maintain their self-obtained entitlement to use everyone&#39;s IP this way, the point of copyright will be rendered useless in the future and creatives will be reluctant to publish their new work. This will have a significant bad impact on humanity.
