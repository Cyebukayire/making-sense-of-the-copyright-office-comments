I believe that the use of the term &quot;intelligence&quot; is misleading many people. These programs are not &quot;intelligent&quot; and are not autonomously creating anything. <br/><br/>AI should be seen not as an entity unto itself but as a tool like a lever. A lever allows a man to lift an object of great weight while exerting relatively little effort and yet we do not deny that he was responsible for the result of his labor. Similarly, AI is enabling people to create with less effort, but I do not believe that this devalues the work that they produce. <br/><br/>To me AI has been an accessibility tool. Where I once struggled to learn particular artistic practices, I am now able to create in a new way that overcomes those previous struggles. I&#39;ve been enabled to make many pieces of art that were once beyond my grasp. It has even helped me to begin to learn some traditional techniques that I had difficulty learning previously.<br/><br/>I dispute the idea that AI art is not an original creation. Simply learning how to create viable prompts is an entirely new artform that takes quite a bit of skill to be done well but beyond that the output is rarely good enough to be a final product, even when it is rendered in good detail. Often a piece comes out of the generator missing elements of my artistic vision, and I need to spend time adding more details, which I do with the help of AI. <br/><br/>I&#39;d also like to comment on the question of whether AI models trained on the work of other artists violates their copyright. It seems to be a well-respected tradition to create work in the style of other artists. You can go to many conventions and find people who can be commissioned to draw you in the style of Bill Watterson&#39;s Calvin and Hobbes, or as a Disney character. You can find many artists online who draw pictures in the style of other popular artists. If they can do this then why can&#39;t an artist using AI do the exact same thing? As I understand it, you cannot copyright a style anyway. <br/><br/>None of the images being produced on AI models are making faithful reproductions of existing copyrighted material. Artists are simply doing what they always do by borrowing a look from other artists that they admire. If an artist puts their work in a museum or posts it online, or in any way offers it for others to view then they ought to be accepting that the people whom they will influence with it may also be influenced to create work like it. <br/><br/>AI is going to be an important tool in the future. It&#39;s going to level the playing field so that the common person will have the same power to create as the large businesses have. It&#39;s going to allow people to produce any number of arts in a fraction of the time they previously could. If AI is allowed to be a tool for the good of humanity then I believe that we will see impressive innovations over the next few years. Let&#39;s not maim this new technology right out of the gate. Let it grow and help people to make bigger and better things.
