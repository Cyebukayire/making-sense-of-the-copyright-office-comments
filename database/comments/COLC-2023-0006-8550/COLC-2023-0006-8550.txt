I am Japanese, and I am very fed up with the Japanese government&#39;s attitude of promoting generative AI.<br/>Japan is not even capable of developing its own AI, and yet it seems to seriously think that it can out-compete other countries by promoting AI and sacrificing IP content because its own IT industry is lagging behind.<br/>Perhaps because Japanese people are exposed to otaku content from a very early age and have a soil of admiration for illustrations, comics, and videos, a great many people mistakenly believe that these contents are inexhaustible and all-you-can-eat. This is no exception for proponents of generative AI. In the past, the development of file-sharing software called Winny in Japan led to widespread illegal sharing of copyrighted materials, causing enormous damage to copyright holders. With the advent of generative AI, the same kind of confusion that occurred with Winny has arisen again. (Some surveys show that Winny users and users of generative AI share the same age group.)<br/><br/>What artists, including myself, are advocating is very simple and clear: &quot;If you want to use it, get permission.<br/>If you want to use it as training data, ask the copyright holder for permission. Don&#39;t hide the training dataset, reveal it.&quot;<br/>In other words, I have always appealed to develop generative AI in an opt-in format. Only those who wish to promote and use generative AI should use their own copyrighted materials as training data. We appeal to you not to involve unrelated people, not to use without permission, and to clarify what you have taken without permission so far.<br/><br/>The users of generative AI are always trying to give some reason, e.g., &quot;It&#39;s a Luddite movement,&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t stop the development of technology,&quot; &quot;Generative AI is useful and inspiring for creation,&quot; &quot;Adapt or die,&quot; and so on.<br/>The results of years of hard work to present them to the world are scraped by companies without permission and used as training data for generative AI. Artists are forced out of the market to face the chimera of their own and others&#39; work. Ignorant humans consume the large amount of work produced by the generative AI, and after seeing it over and over again, they become bored with it and lash out at the artist, who is the main source of the work, saying they are tired of it. Artists are abandoned as no longer useful.<br/><br/>Damage to artists abounds in Japan. <br/>For example, artists&#39; past works are imported into AI to create and sell a large number of NSFW images in the artist&#39;s style. Exploitation companies advertise their games under the guise of illustrators&#39; drawings.<br/>When a rough draft of the work in progress is sent to the client, a new product is output based on the image through the AI, and the client escapes without paying the fee.<br/>AI users verbally attack the artist, saying, &quot;AI&#39;s output is better than your art.&quot;<br/>They collectively rant against artists, generate i2i images of art, and laugh at them as &quot;anti-intellectuals who can&#39;t keep up with advanced technology.<br/>They stalk people on the Internet and make murder threats.<br/>They make counterfeit money and claim it as art.<br/>Moreover, there is no law in Japan to control them. They throw art into a mixer of generative AI and make a mess of it while mouthing the words &quot;it&#39;s legal&quot;.<br/>Japan&#39;s copyright law is very tolerant of generative AI, which is rare in the world.<br/>It is ludicrous that Japan is weak against external pressure from the US, EU, Australia, and others, yet it wants to take the lead in AI. Japan does not understand that if it continues to allow generative AI to go unchecked, it will be clawed back by the world as a nation that &quot;disrespects human rights. We expect the U.S. to put pressure on Japan.<br/><br/>Generative AI cannot even maintain its form without the artist&#39;s artist&#39;s art, photographs, and various other online works. Despite this, users of generative AI tend to spit at and look down on artists.<br/>They may mistakenly believe that their own abilities have increased with the help of AI.<br/>They are looking at fields they have never even paid attention to as potential money generators, trampling underfoot, and spitting on them as they leave.<br/>This distorted situation must not be allowed to continue.<br/><br/>In addition, the problem of generative AI, if left unchecked, will cross the field and head more and more in a direction where exploitation is possible. It will take in voices, appearances, photos of people posted on social networking sites, landscapes, videos, and even animations. It would be foolish to give anyone the technology to make deepfake technology so easy to create. It must not be left unchecked until it becomes unstoppable.<br/><br/>The strike by SAG-AFTRA is something we have been paying attention to. As a human being, we are very proud and respectful of it and support it as a resistance movement against exploitative companies.
