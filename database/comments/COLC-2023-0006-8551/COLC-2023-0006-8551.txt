GenAI is a threat to copyright and those copyright is supposed to protect. If we allow corporations and everybody else to just take the work of creatives and train their models without proper licensing we&#39;ll severely damage the creative industry and put millions of people out of jobs. Not just in the US but worldwide.<br/>Right now the only protection Artists have is that Ai generated works can&#39;t be copyrighted and that is good but it needs to also protect the work of Artist before the training process starts.<br/><br/>Introducing GenAi into the work of creatives will have a chain reaction and unfair competition. Creatives market themselves through their works. It is already a very competitive field. We&#39;re putting our work out there in hopes to make a name for ourselves and get hired. But that also means our work is out there for everybody to grab and train their GenAI model on. So the more we improve and put ourselves out there the more we hurt ourselves and give people the opportunity to use our work against us. Companies will hire artists specifically to fuel their own training set and then kick them out once they have what they needed. It&#39;ll be a race to make creatives obsolete and devalue the work creatives do. People will be forced to underbid each other and needing to use Ai in order to compete fueling the pockets of big Tech even further.<br/><br/>But also entry jobs into the industry will be fully replaced by GenAi making it harder for students or people who change careers to find any employment.<br/>The speed in which GenAI can create images makes it impossible to compete with in most of the industry jobs where quality might not be the aim of the game. (But that is only a question of time until these algorithms improve) The market will be flooded with and devalue any creative work. People will have to work more in order to make the same money they made before GenAi to pay rent or support their family. We&#39;ve already witnessed over the past 2 decades how creative work is valued less and less. So if we put the ability to generate hundreds if not thousands of images a day per person the future of the creative industry will look very bleak.<br/><br/>The term of democratizing art is constantly thrown around but the only winners here will be the corporations who have the money and resources to support the hungry needs of GenAi while labor will struggle even more. <br/><br/>So when it comes to Artificial Intelligence and Copyright I argue that those two should be kept far apart. We don&#39;t have the economical structure to prepare and support people for the devastating consequences it&#39;ll have.<br/><br/>I&#39;d also like to link to this academic paper &quot;AI Art and its Impact on Artists&quot;: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681
