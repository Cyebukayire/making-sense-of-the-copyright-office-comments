<br/> <br/><br/> Technology has few uses, but mainly it is a potential means for AI developers (with the help of unscrupulous corporations and individuals) to usurp profits of the creative industry. The risks outweigh any supposed benefits as it will allow for greater instances of scams, piracy, copyright infringement, CSAM, blackmail, propaganda, and the flooding of the internet, and other forms of communication, with generated content. https://www.createdontscrape.com/  please check out this site. Unregulated AI currently is affecting creatives, copyright holders and the public negatively. The issues above highlight some of the problems AI has, and for all these concerns, AI companies failed to put in place guard rails and ensure that their services and software wouldn&rsquo;t violate people&rsquo;s rights. I am not against this technology, but the best path forward is good innovation that benefits all not just a few who stand to profit. We need more regulation and protections for the public to get towards safe and reliable AI technology.  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>I believe that stakeholders in other industries share many of the same concerns as those within my industry of interest. Generative AI models have been &ldquo;trained&rdquo; and distributed by Stability AI, and Runway ML along with help from Laion and others. Stability AI&rsquo;s main product, Stable diffusion uses the works of various visual artists and includes images from citizens here in the United States and abroad. Chat GPT by Open AI along with other LLMs are trained on various copyrighted written works (some of which come from book piracy sites). The LLM products available may contain code that was misappropriated and contain personally identifiable information from consumers on the internet. Entertainment studios large and small hope to be able to copy the likenesses and voices of actors by forcing them into contracts that force them to help train models for meager wages. The same is true in other creative fields for which there is a work for hire employment. Because the generative products are widely distributed on the internet, there are many instances where people have their creative works, voices, and likenesses scraped and placed into models for individuals to create derivatives, make people say or sing music they wouldn&rsquo;t, and have them participating in situations they wouldn&rsquo;t.  <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> Here is paper about the effects of AI on artists https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3600211.3604681.

Another paper but this one deals with how many AI/ML researchers tend to to not consider risks and how their focus usually is on hyping these algorithms. It&rsquo;s immensely important that policy makers and regulatory agencies not fall for their misrepresentations of the true and present harms we all face as mentioned previously. surveyed. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>There was an effort by the UK parliament to allow TDM exceptions for commercial use of AI. However, the parliament was convinced to not go through with this thanks to the effort of various creative rights groups, and MP Sarah Olney. While in Japan there appears to be interest in regulating AI, but it seems that they may be treating the AI in a similar way to how copyright laws deal with copyright infringement committed by people. Basically, they may make a copyright law that only focuses on outputs of AI, but it appears that the inputs are only relevant when dealing with AI content being like an individual artist&rsquo;s work. We should avoid policies that give AI companies carte blanche to appropriate all creative works for their AI programs like what nearly happened in Britain neither should we let them get out of liability by focusing mostly on outputs. Protection for creatives should be apart of a federal right of publicity policy. <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>
