Raw AI output should not be able to be copyrighted since it takes very little effort to produce things using AI, this a person or company could for example produce millions of images and claim copyright infringement on anything that looks vaguely similar. For cases where works have had significant manual editing you should be able to copyright it, so my overall view is that copyright should be allowed only on things that fall more into the category of actual art rather than AI generation. Additionally copyright protection should not apply to training AI models as new works can only be said to be of a similar style and not a direct copy.
