The realm of imagination is infinite. The realm of art that I can create with my own skill and time is far smaller. Artificial Intelligence has allowed me to express myself on an unprecedented scale and within an unbelievably ample scope in the short time that AI-powered image generators have existed. This was my first personal introduction into the use of such tools. As for the language transformers that have come into fashion, I am thoroughly astounded at the sheer marvel of these systems, particularly the potential they hold for being edifying conversation partners who are available at a moment&rsquo;s notice for a discussion about any topic. They allow me to rapidly research any topic, within seconds,  and to reach a degree of understanding, of nuance, and of insight sufficient to challenge and reach conclusions regarding my prior assumptions about them, that would otherwise have taken me days or months. I am absolutely thrilled at the immediate reaity of these technologies improving the quality of my own understanding and reasoning about any subject I have used them to reseach, by the scope and scale of solutions for everyday life that people around me are making available, and the expressive possibilities that these systems have opened up for me in such a short time.
