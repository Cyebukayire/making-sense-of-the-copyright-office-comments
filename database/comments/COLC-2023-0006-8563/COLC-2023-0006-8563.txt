 AI should be treated no differently than existing software tools when it comes to regulation. Just as we don&#39;t penalize someone for using Photoshop or a camera, we should apply similar standards to AI technology. Our current laws already effectively address illegal activities regardless of the technology involved. Specialized AI regulations are unnecessary and a waste of taxpayer resources.
