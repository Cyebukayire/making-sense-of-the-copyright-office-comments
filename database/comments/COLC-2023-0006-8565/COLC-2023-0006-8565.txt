AI should be treated similar to a person in copyright law. Just as a person can read any book, article, web page, or see any art, and learn from it and make things that could be considered similar, an AI should have that right. AI works on brain principles and learns, so it&#39;s not much different than a human for its currently limited abilities. Inventing AI is important to humanity, and could save many lives. Taking away AIs ability to learn and derive from that knowledge would be highly damaging as that&#39;s the only way the technology can advance. Putting restrictions on AI that prevent it from learning from available knowledge that any human can learn from, would be akin to governments from the past banning calculators to save the jobs of humans who did manual calculations. While some of these creative jobs would vanish, it is a natural phenomenon that humans become more efficient with their technology and humans who have jobs that can be automated will have to find other jobs. Banning a learning algorithm or banning it from learning from public sources would be illogical since any human can do exactly what the AI would do, learn and derive from art, books, etc. It would in essence be a law that says one brain is banned but not another, even though they do the same thing. I&#39;m of the opinion that AI should be given wide freedom, as it&#39;s vital to humans that AI be trained and funded.
