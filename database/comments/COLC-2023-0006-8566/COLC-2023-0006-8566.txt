I use AI for everything. I use Stable Diffusion as part of my workflow while 3D-modeling by using it to create textures or images for things like book covers or paintings. You can even use the images to create displacement maps (essentially, a texture that affects the shape of the 3D-model). I&#39;ve used Stable Diffusion&#39;s image to image tool on a custom trained AI model to compare the accuracy of my 3D-models to the source material. You can even use Stable Diffusion to create hundreds of concept arts in a few hours, which was a life saver when I was trying to create a 3D-printable mask for Halloween.<br/><br/>I even use language based models like ChatGPT as a part of my 3D-modeling process. I no longer need to write the boring Lorem Ipsum for a note in the scene, I can actually put in interesting text in them for the viewer to read.<br/><br/>But that&#39;s just for 3D-modeling. I&#39;ve used ChatGPT to program entire tools in Python with minimal programming experience or used it to find bugs in my code. I&#39;ve used it to research complex topics, because ChatGPT can simplify it and provide directions to helpful sites. Heck, it even helped me diagnose a problem in my car and helped me with my thermodynamics homework.<br/><br/>Putting copyright restrictions on AI&#39;s training data would seriously limit the knowledge of AI tools like ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion, which would make me unable to do many of the things I just mentioned.<br/><br/>I can understand banning training off of a specific artists work without their permission, though. We have a rule in place in our AI development community specifically for banning that type of training. Same goes for copying someone&#39;s voice.
