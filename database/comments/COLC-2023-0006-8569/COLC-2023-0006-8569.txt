As an independent artist, my biggest complaint is that Generative Image AIs have exploited the work of myself and my peers. These AI products can not function the way that they do without the work of human artists. The function of these AI products has enabled these companies to rake in an increasing amount of investment capital. In short, they&#39;ve taken our work without permission or compensation in order to enrich themselves. Its extremely frustrating and it would be nice if copyright regulation could be extended to protect artists from this type of exploitation.
