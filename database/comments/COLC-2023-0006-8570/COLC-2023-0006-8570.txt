Generative Ai that scrapes or has scraped public data destroys the innovation and creativity that intellectual property law is designed to nourish, by competing with the creative class with derivatives of their own work, and discouraging them from making anything new, lest it be appropriated as well. It doesn&rsquo;t create anything new in its place. It is eternally backward facing. It&rsquo;s not the future, it&rsquo;s the past. It&rsquo;s forever and always the past. If we&rsquo;re not careful we will remain there.
