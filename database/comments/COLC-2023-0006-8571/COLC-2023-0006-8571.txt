When AI-generated content appears in creative works, none of said work should be copyrightable, including the non-AI parts, through an &ldquo;unclean hands&rdquo; doctrine. This may seem quite a huge step, but it simply recognises the reality that there is probably no way of knowing if the AI-components&rsquo; underlying data was originally obtained legally or illegally. This means we should ban AI from the Arts. If we do not, then the creative industries will collapse, with it the Arts and, with that, humanity itself.<br/><br/>We also need to remember the underlying purpose of copyright law, which must be to protect originality. If people cannot protect their originality, then there will be far less of it, if any, which will hamper innovation. Imagine if companies could not protect their patents or trademarks. Entire industries would fail.<br/><br/>Much of the defence of AI is that it is only a &ldquo;tool&rdquo;. I agree it is a tool, but the question is whether that tool is being used legally or illegally. A crowbar used to burgle a house is also a tool. Data law needs to be strengthened and enforced, so that data can only be used if there is a valid legal reason. &ldquo;Fair use&rdquo; and &ldquo;legitimate interest&rdquo; is not good enough and &ldquo;research purposes&rdquo; should not be abused, especially where a commercial entity sets up a research non-profit, so it can then take the data to use for commercial purposes (data laundering).<br/><br/>As I say, AI needs to be banned from the Arts completely and this needs to be written into the Berne Convention. Nothing less will protect creators, democracy or human rights.
