I do not believe that AI generated content if anykind, writing, music, art, film, animation,etc should be allowed copyright protection of any kind. Copyrights should be reserved for human created works that support human creators. AI generated content is known to pull from data bases of stolen works from writers, artists etc and is unethical for others to profit off of this stolen data. People wishing to gain copyright protection from stolen AI generated data and content should not be rewarded with copyright protection. Please choose to support human creators and jobs.
