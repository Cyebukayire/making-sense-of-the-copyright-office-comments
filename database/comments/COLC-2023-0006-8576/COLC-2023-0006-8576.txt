Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through theft of creative work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work writers create and regurgitate and mimic it in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; they predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of their work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if they choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of their creative lives and work. <br/><br/>Further, companies using large language models such as ChatGPT and Bard should be held liable when their tool slanders or misinforms.<br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Tom Mullaney<br/>Hillsborough, NC
