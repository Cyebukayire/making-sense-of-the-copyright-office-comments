&quot;Generative AI&quot; is already infringing on copyright at a massive scale - the companies who run these generators admit to simply scraping the internet for images and text that are already under copyright, and I do not believe using them as a training database qualifies under transformative use. Furthermore, companies are using the output of these models to evade paying for the works of artists and writers. I believe the output of generative AI should not be copyrightable; the submission of prompts to a generator is not the same as performing the labor of actually drawing, writing, or illustrating.
