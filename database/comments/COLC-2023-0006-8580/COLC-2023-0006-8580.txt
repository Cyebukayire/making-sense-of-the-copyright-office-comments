Generative AI such as ChatGPT and Midjourney only function due to large-scale, unauthorized use of copyrighted material as training data. They are capable of reproducing many protected aspects of individuals, such as their likeness, exact word-for-word copies of written works, and occasionally, near-exact reproductions of artwork. What&rsquo;s more, they create a smokescreen effect where the market for books, artwork, and various services is flooded with AI-produced copycatting, often burying the original artists or writers whose work is being stolen. Finally, generative AI can impersonate individuals and misrepresent their views, opinions, or facts about their life. Such an ecosystem will lead to a chilling effect in the creative arts, as real artists and writers will be highly hesitant to share work for fear of having it stolen for use in training data.
