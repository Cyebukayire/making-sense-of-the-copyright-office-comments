As a music maker, I appreciate the Copyright Office&#39;s Notice of Inquiry on generative artificial intelligence and copyright, and I urge the office to incorporate the perspective of artists, songwriters, producers and other individual creative workers. The work you are undertaking will influence generations of creators, and safeguarding human creativity must remain the foundation of any future rule or regulation. <br/> <br/>Generative AI is an exciting technology that has already expanded the universe of who can create music, eliminating traditional barriers to entry and making creativity more accessible. As a tool and instrument, it can unlock unprecedented potential, and push the known limits of music making. But generative AI should not be left unchecked to displace or eliminate human creativity. The Copyright Office must protect human creators. Some of the tools I use using generative AI are www.muso.ai and www.Moises.ai. Muso.ai shows stream counts from Spotify, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, SoundCloud, Shazam, and now the performing rights organizations, the distributors, and the companies themselves need to be aware that streaming royalties for digital creators are needed. Sadly, even though that both ASCAP and BMI signed the www.humanartistrycampaign.com which is an agreement about the usage of AI, neither will publicly use the system so that all royalties can be paid. Transparency is the biggest issue. Also, I have evidence from a blessed 39 Mil Spotify streamed song that BMI cannot be trusted in regarding digital royalty payments and need government oversight. BMI diminishes the stream counts based on their perceived counts rather than pay what is shown from service not diminished by domestic or international counts.<br/><br/>Sure! We have attached a merged .CSV file that contains your royalty payment history back to Q1 2017. You will see that Legendary royalties from Spotify account for 17,558,080 performances starting in Q2 2017 when the song was released. These are all the domestic performances that generated royalties reported by Spotify. You were also paid by 26 other countries for this title. We do not know how many Spotify performances make up these foreign royalties, as that information is not given to us. <br/> <br/>Let us know if we can assist you further. Thank you. <br/> <br/>- statement@bmi.com  <br/><br/>Additionally, BMI wrote,<br/><br/>Hello,<br/> <br/>The performance count included in your royalty Statements will ONLY include those that are performed in the United States. When your works are played in other countries, those plays appear in your YouTube and Spotify counts online, but they WILL NOT appear in your BMI Statements. This is because foreign societies do not provide us the performance counts when they occur in other countries. In a previous reply, we attached a spreadsheet showing your total earnings for &quot;Legendary&quot;. The performance count cells highlighted in red are blank because these earnings came from foreign countries. Foreign societies do not provide this information, but they do send royalties (column L). You have been paid correctly for your performances, the Statement just does not show foreign performance counts.<br/> <br/>Thank you,<br/> <br/>statement@bmi.com<br/> <br/>Moises.ai and Lalal.ai are tools that use Ai to isolate and separate instruments and vocals from mp3s. There needs to be more audio watermarking services available so that all elements of songs are protected.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to listen to the creators and working professionals most impacted by generative AI.
