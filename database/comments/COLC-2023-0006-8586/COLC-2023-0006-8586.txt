I believe that works generated by AI cannot, by definition, be considered as violating copyright. Although the AI was trained on the work of others, it studied them to identify concepts that could be regarded as fair use. Of course, AI can generate a copy of the work on which it was trained, but in such cases, the responsibility should be borne by the person who generated this picture. However, modern technologies make it possible to heavily modify the generated content, reducing the likelihood of it resembling someone else&#39;s work. Hence, the chances of infringing on copyright decrease significantly.<br/><br/>Additionally, I believe that if a person uses AI on their computer with their own modifications, the resulting work cannot be easily replicated due to the vast number of possible settings and combinations. Therefore, I believe that such work can be eligible for copyright protection if the person can prove that they created it without relying on someone else&#39;s site or resources.<br/><br/>
