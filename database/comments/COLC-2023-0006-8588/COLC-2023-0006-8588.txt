Artificial Intelligence is an emerging technology that requires strict regulation in order to protect the actual human creatives its large training sets depend on to function. AI generated text, images, and other forms of expression currently rely on sample sets created by humans who have not been compensated for their time or efforts, while AI companies stand to profit immensely. No AI system should be allowed to operate on text, images, or other source material that hasn&#39;t been paid for, and they should not be permitted to scrape the internet at large and take everything they find. AI works should not be able to be copyrighted, as they are produced via an amalgam of works that already exist; copyright for information they use should be attributed to the original human authors.
