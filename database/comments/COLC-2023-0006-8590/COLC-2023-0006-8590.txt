Each new medium for creativity faces scrutiny. Photography was initially not considered art, but now the works of great photographers hang on the walls of the most prestigious museums of the world, along side paintings by the great painters. Every artist uses different tools to create their works, but what they all have in common is that they were influenced by those that came before them. <br/><br/>Painters were influenced by other painters and their surroundings, Writers by other writers who preceded them, sculptors and architects, poets, and philosophers. All human creative output has been built upon the foundation laid by those that came before us. Generative AI is simply a new tool, that is once again receiving criticism. <br/><br/>Many artists have leveled accusations of copyright infringement, against models trained on their works. But are these models producing duplicates of their works, or like the artists leveling these claims, merely allowing other artists to incorporate stylistic influences to generate new, transformative content and works? <br/><br/>Id say that it is allowing for the first time arts to cross boundaries. Images can now be generated with extremely descriptive prompts. Before AI, we would have called these prompts poetry, others can now transform drawings into photo, or photos into poetry, choosing which influences they incorporate, just like the artists they are choosing, chose their own stylist influences along the way to arrive at their style. <br/><br/>If I as a photographer train AI to produce works in the style of my work, that is fair use. I as a photographer also can name other photographers before me who have influenced my style; Paulo Roversi, Guy Bourdain, Herb Ritz...etc... If I incorporate their works into the training of my AI so that it better represents the style of work that I wish to do, or the direction that my style is evolving, is that infringing on their copyright if their works are not being duplicated, merely observed by and learned from the model, just as a student observes and learns from an art book?<br/><br/>All tools have always had one goal, to make things easier to do.<br/><br/>Many people have artistic vision, but have lacked the tools, time, or physical talents to allow them to express their vision. Generative AI is a tool that enables many more people express their creativity, and it allows them to do so in transformative ways, and to achieve outputs that would not be achieved by another individual, with the outputs governed by the creativity of their inputs.<br/><br/>
