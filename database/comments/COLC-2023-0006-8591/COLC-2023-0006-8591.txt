Hello, <br/><br/>My name is Ryan, and I&#39;m a member of the Writers Guild of America and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to prioritize human creativity and creative workers during its inquiry into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers. The new WGA agreement contains important protections, prohibiting media companies from using AI to devalue our work. Writers, however, cannot address all of our concerns through collective bargaining&mdash;we need public policy solutions too. <br/><br/>AI models that generate art replace human creativity through the theft of our work. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. Only human artists can create original art by drawing on our unique lived experience. Writers work to develop and maintain careers based on their individual voices. AI models, by contrast, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. Film and television writers are employees; we predominantly create works for hire and are thus not copyright holders, but like other rightsholders, WGA members should be protected by a statutory right to consent to the use of our work to train AI models and should be compensated fairly if we choose to do so. AI technology as it is currently being implemented poses a profound threat to writers and the integrity of our creative lives and work.<br/><br/>Copyright and patent law in the US has been successfully used for decades to reward the intellectual efforts of individuals and companies within the US while protecting their creative output from theft/duplication. And while this system has brought immense wealth, prestige, and progress to the US; the danger of unregulated AI churning out barely tweaked copies of existing material (creative, scientific, etc) at an unfathomable pace could not only cripple the copyright/patent owners ability to earn money off their intellectual property -- it could also flood the market with half-cooked shit. There is a real danger posed by using large language models and other machine learning tools indiscriminately to &quot;pollute&quot; the market or information ecosystem with junk. This harm affects not only writers and other creative workers like myself, but also the downstream customer/consumer. The time to get ahead of this technology is now.  <br/><br/>Thank you for consideration of my comments.
