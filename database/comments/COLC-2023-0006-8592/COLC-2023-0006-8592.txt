AI art is just another tool in the wheel house for artist not the death of the craft. It needs references to create and therefore will never replace artist. It allows people who don&rsquo;t have the abilities of others to still express their art. It will allow for animators to do their jobs in much less of the time and there will always remain those who appreciate the artist that help make it possible at all.
