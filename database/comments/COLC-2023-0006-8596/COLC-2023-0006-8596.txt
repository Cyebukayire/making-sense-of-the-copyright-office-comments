See attached file summarizing results from studies that have been commissioned as part of the Project on the Right to Research in International Copyright coordinated by American University&rsquo;s Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property. That project focuses on uses of copyrighted works in text and data mining technology by scientific researchers. The same text and data mining research methods are used as critical inputs in generative AI applications. Accordingly, policymakers need to mindful of the overlapping uses less policy responses to one problem (promoting creativity) cause another (restriction of research methods).
