<br/><br/>I don&#39;t think that AI should be treated differently from existing software tools. If we don&#39;t penalize someone for using Photoshop or a camera, we shouldn&#39;t penalize the use of AI tools. Current laws already address illegal activities regardless of the technology used. Specialized AI regulations are unnecessary and a waste of taxpayer money. <br/>Over-regulation is also likely to lead to a future where only a few corporations dominate the AI landscape. Let&#39;s foster innovation and ensure AI benefits all rather than a handful of corporations that already hold a near monopoly on our devices and software.
