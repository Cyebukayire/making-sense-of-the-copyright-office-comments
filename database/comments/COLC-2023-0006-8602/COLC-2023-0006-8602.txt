I believe in not granting copyright to artificially generated images nor letting these programs,their users and makers to make use of copyrighted works without consent and permission.I have a few reasons.First,these programs are designed specifically to not draw,but to generate randomised images.In order to claim you illustrated an image,you have to actually &quot;draw&quot; the said image.Machine generated images are &quot;generated&quot;,and not &quot;drawn&quot;.While some claim image generators are &quot;just like modern drawing tools&quot;,i find this either dishonest or misinformed.These &quot;tools&quot; are vastly different to modern tools such as digital drawing tablets,which actively requires you to &quot;draw&quot;and are incomparable to image generators.This is not a tool for drawing,but to actively avoid drawing.If a person uses the said &quot;tool&quot; to skip the entire drawing process of an illustration,that person did not &quot;draw&quot;,and therefore, that person is not an illustrator.If said person is not the &quot;illustrator&quot;,why should that person attain copyright protection for something they did not &quot;illustrate&quot;.I also view voice acting,singing and writing in the same manner.There are some claims as to whether there are some artistic merits to generating an image.i disagree,and this will lead me to my next reason.Simply typing words such as &quot;woman,blonde,trending on artstation&quot; into an image generator does not make said person an illustrator.The decison makings invloved in every steps,from every strokes to of illustrations with copyright protections are soley lacking in someone generating an image.No matter how specific that person may think the words he typed,the fact being that person is wholly absent from the actual decision makings of the painting process.Simply typing something unspecific and only using a few words will also generate an image,which backs up my claim of these people lacking true step by step decision making.This is similar to simply googling an image,which will provide you the images most relevant to the words you typed into the search bar,which does not make you an illustrator even though the google search provided images to you.A person Google searching the Mona Lisa in HD does not make said person a painter.Some claims as to what the image generator provide as new images,i also disagree with this.(A)First,the actions you take to generate images is identical to google searching.If this is a truly artistic process and identical to illustrators using tools,then everyone who have used google image search would be an illustrator.(B)And the second point with this view i disagree is that whether or not the resulting image is new is irrelevant if you were to make the claim such as &quot;using the image generator is the same as using painting tools&quot; because, a painter may identically copy someone else painting(for which said painter will get into legal trouble regarding copyright,similar to claiming a google searched image as your own creation and profitting from it),the fact remains is,that painter,even though plagiarized someone&#39;s work,is still a painter,as he still painted the copycat piece.Yet we never consider someone whom googled an image as an artist.Because they did not illustrate.So i see no reason to consider somone typing in an image generator,which is identical in action to google searching,as an illustrator.Even if someone were to claim the opposite of my reasoning,the fact being said person  (if they were to claim they contributed which i see otherwise for reasoning B)contributed the least in the creating process,the bulk of the resulting generated image coming from the image generator and the countless creative and copyrighted artworks that have been fed to the image generator,without consent nor permission.Also the generated images are not truly new.All this leads to my third reason.We never could use copyrighted works without permissions.So in order to express ourselves,we create our own original works,leading to innovation,competition and increase in number and variety of original works,which will inspire others to come up with their original works.The machine learning programs promote bloating of unoriginal contents,while exploiting and punishing creatives who put out original contents.Not only are image generators,their users and their creators actively exploiting creatives but also seeking special treatment to bypass copyright while wanting copyright for themselves.I find this unacceptable.The images generated are not innovative nor original.They can only generate what they have been fed,an illusion born from a mash of stolen works.Some believe every art is just a remix and so it should be ok to steal,which is an extremly narrow view of creativity.Every alphabet in a Sherlock Holmes novel already exists but it is not a mere remix of words.The entire point of creativity is to keep pushing &amp; create new things and humans will always come up with original works before,now,and,in the future.
