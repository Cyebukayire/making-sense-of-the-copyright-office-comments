1) Does using copyrighted work in AI training data constitute an infringement of the works&#39; copyright?<br/><br/>I believe that using copyrighted work in training an AI dataset does constitute an infringement on the original work. My reasoning for this is that the process of AI generation is not *really* transformative, it&#39;s merely very complicated statistics on the original work. For example, Dr Tom Goldstein from the University of Maryland has done a great deal of work on identifying generative AI models that copy their training data into generated images (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20086). For example, when asked for a painting, the generative AI will generate a picture of a room with the painting on the wall of the room. However, the image of the room is pulled almost entirely from another image in its training set - even down to copying the patterns of the folds of a blanket in the image.<br/><br/>I believe this follows from how the systems work: training data is not really &quot;abstracted away&quot;, but is instead stored in the system as a set of probabilities. this means that those original images can always come back if the right set of probabilities occurs. I don&#39;t think that qualifies as &quot;transformative&quot; or &quot;derivative&quot;, just &quot;lucky.&quot;<br/><br/>2) copyrightability of generated works<br/><br/>I believe the line for copyrightability should be drawn quite close to the &quot;human&quot; side of the balance. I think it is perfectly reasonable to use an AI to &quot;prompt&quot; a human (i.e. give them story ideas, broad outlines of a story arc, etc) for ideas. However, allowing AI to build the bulk of the work with only minimal human oversight/review brings us back to the damages from using copyrighted work in training - if the AI auto-generates a massively plagiarized text that the human didn&#39;t know about (because they hadn&#39;t read the story), you now have a challenge if the work was copyrightable. This is especially true as allowing minimal human oversight to qualify a work as copyrightable will encourage minimizing that cost - if copyrightability can be granted by simple human review &amp; modifying a few words, I expect that work will be outsourced to services like Mechanical Turk quite quickly. That will turn the purpose of copyright on its head: copyright is intended to support artists from rampant copying of their work and allowing them to profit from their work. Allowing effectively infinite derivative works to be generated from their work with only minimal human oversight and responsibility is exactly the opposite of what copyright was created for.<br/><br/>Therefore, I do not believe that simply prompting an AI system is enough to qualify a work for copyright. I think the default should be that AI  generated systems cannot be copyrighted unless their use was &lt; 50% of the overall effort used to generate the work.<br/><br/>3) Liability for infringing works generated using AI systems<br/><br/>I think the answer to this question depends strongly on the decisions made in question 1. If using a copyrighted work for training data is a reasonable fair use, then its replication in any generated output is fair use *by* *the* *developer*. In that case, the developer would still have to take reasonable steps to react if they learned that their system was being used systematically to violate someone else&#39;s copyright. For example, if it came out that Stable Diffusion was much better at making pictures of Mickey Mouse endorsing products, and is being used that way, it&#39;s incumbent on the developers to fix that as soon as possible, but as long as they act in good faith on that front, they would be covered. This is obviously the stance preferred by the industry.<br/><br/>However, that is not the only assumption that can be made, nor do I think it&#39;s the right one. Given that I said above that I do feel that using an AI <br/><br/>4) Style transfer/deepfake/voicefake rights (i.e. using someone else&#39;s likeness/voice/or style without their permission)<br/><br/>I very strongly feel that creating voicefakes/deepfakes of a person without their consent are a violation of a persons rights, both rights of publicity and unfair competition. I understand there may be cases where people voluntarily sign away those rights, such as when modeling for a digital character in a movie, I think those cases need to be limited to specific instances (one movie/series/tv show). I very strongly believe it should not be legal for someone to sign away the right to use their likeness and voice in artificially generated images/videos/audio for their entire life. Artists and actors should never be in a position where they are competing with digitized versions of themselves. This may require some expansion of the law to include copyright coverage for likenesses and voice patterns, if it does not cover that at present.
