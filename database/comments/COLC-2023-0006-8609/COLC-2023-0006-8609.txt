Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I&#39;m an author-illustrator for graphic novels and comics, and I urge the U.S. Copyright Office to uphold human creativity and creative workers during its examination into artificial intelligence and copyright. The recently concluded 148-day WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike highlight the urgency of artificial intelligence (AI) issues for creative workers, and how media corporations want to devalue the labor of creative workers by using AI in their stead. Although the new WGA agreement contains important protections, other creative professionals are vulnerable to having their livelihoods impacted as well. Public policy solutions are necessary for protecting writers, visual artists, and many other creative workers. <br/><br/>AI models do not generate art through thin air&mdash; this technology pulls from existing work, actively stealing from artists, the hours and days they poured into each work, and the years they&#39;ve spent cultivating their skill. Such AI-generated work should not be entitled to copyright protection. AI models, are fed the work we create, and then regurgitate and mimic us in their outputs. It is a weak attempt to replicate the original art informed by the unique lived experience of each artist. Art and creative work is constantly devalued in our society that values profit over all else, and allowing AI-generated work that steals from existing art to be valued as equal is another nail in the coffin for working professionals who already lack protections.<br/><br/>Thank you for consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Cynthia Cheng<br/>NJ
