AI generated artwork from programs like Midjourney and Dall-e threaten the integrity of the future of art. Current copyrights are not being respected and abided by. AI prompters abuse and break current copyright law by using copyright photos and artwork to make &quot;new&quot; art. The future of art is at stake. Art will die if these programs continue to be allowed to be used. These programs would not be able to function without artwork that already has a copyright. These programs need abolished. They cannot function without copyright artwork and therefore are intrisnicly flawed and break our current laws intrisnicly.
