I believe that generative AI is actively harmful to creatives and the public at large. Because generative AI feeds on large data sets that could come from whatever is posted online, it will only regurgitate something based on that pre-existing data. AI, as it stands, cannot create something new. It can only make something based on what it&#39;s given. There&#39;s nothing human that comes out of generative AI when all it does is regurgitate content.<br/><br/>I can only see generative AI working within internal production pipelines that&#39;s built upon original content that workers made themselves for the sake of speeding up their workflow, but not when they&#39;re pulling from content that they did not make such as images from a search engine. Therefore, these AI tools should only be used to improve upon existing jobs instead of outright replacing jobs.<br/><br/>While I do not condone the use of generative AI, I also do not think that bolstering our current copyright regulations is the way to do it. Generative AI should be regulated in such a way that prevents it from stealing content from other people without consent at minimum. Perhaps one way to do it would be to deny generative AI content of having copyright protections whenever it&#39;s pulling data from sources that were not made internally, since it&#39;s inherently incapable of being creative.
