Hello. I&#39;m writing to inform you about a company that is violating intellectual property rights on a nationwide (and global) scale. The purpose of this letter is to raise awareness about a company named OpenAI, an American-based IT company and how it&#39;s breaking the law every day.<br/><br/>OpenAI (openai.com) provides software named &quot;GTP,&quot; which is software that generates text as though a human wrote the text. It was built with data from the Common Crawl dataset, a conglomerate of stolen copyrighted articles, internet posts, web pages, and books scraped from 60 million domains over a period of 12 years. TechCrunch reports this data includes copyrighted material from BBC, The New York Times, Reddit, the full text of online books, and more. <br/><br/>(https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/here-are-a-few-ways-gpt-3-can-go-wrong) <br/><br/>So anyone who ever published anything on Internet anywhere, therefore, has had pieces of their content illegally collected, distributed, and sold to people using GTP-based writing tools. This page points to examples of where people found stolen material published by this program: <br/><br/>https://justoutsourcing.blogspot.com/2022/03/gpts-plagiarism-links.html<br/><br/>The United States Copyright Office recently ruled that non-human expression is ineligible for copyright protection. So for those who wish to simply copy and paste the text with this GPT thing, this new ruling means everything they generate with GPT becomes public domain material. So this company is basically taking copyrighted material and putting it into the public domain.<br/><br/>This includes images too. OpenAI has another program called &quot;Dall-e,&quot; which manipulates images stolen from the internet and (according to the copyright law above), puts them into the public domain as well. It&#39;s other program, CoPilot, is also removing the property rights of programming code. <br/><br/>So this thing is stripping the rights of everything it gobbled up from the internet, and the company is making millions from people who never see a dime from it:<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- people who live on welfare or a limited income<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- low wage earners <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- children who are too young to agree to a contract<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- people who have been victims of a security breach (their PII is sold as well)<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>- dead people<br/><br/>OpenAI additionally serves a global audience. That means the company is selling this country&#39;s intellectual property and citizen PII to foreigners and foreign governments.<br/><br/>This cannot be allowed to continue, and I sincerely hope that you strongly consider alerting the public about the ramifications this has on generations of creators who will not be able to claim rights to the works they produce. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading,<br/>Nicole Miller
