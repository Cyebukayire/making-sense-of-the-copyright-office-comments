First the AI companies trained on every artist&rsquo;s work that was ever put in the internet. They stole from everyone and now they are trying to use that stolen work to put artists out of business. All of mine and other&rsquo;s work on the internet is copyrighted. We were never asked or paid&hellip; they stole from us. Help us right the wrong they are doing to every artist. An AI can&rsquo;t create it just copies and calls it something new.
