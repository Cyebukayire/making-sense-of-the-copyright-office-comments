Artificial intelligence and machine learning offer the average person an ever expanding range of capability, that will be essential as the technology continue to develop. With the potential for loss of careers, work, and income generating employment, due to AI and machine learning, I feel it is essential the U.S. government take steps to address THAT particular eventuality, while freeing up restrictions that are or may be placed on open source technology. If the U.S. government is not going to protect llivelihoods from the impacts of corporate backing and support for AI/machine learning in commerce-focused pursuits, the U.S. government should at very least allow individuals the breadth to use AI to create new forms of income generation and support for life.
