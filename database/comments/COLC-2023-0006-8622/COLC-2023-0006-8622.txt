AI, unlike humans, cannot learn like we do and needs millions of examples of what it will then copy.  And AI programmers, of course, did not ask tens of thousands of artists for permission to their works.  At the same time, how big companies decide to fire real people, who have had their identity and life&#39;s work stolen, for AI.  This is completely unfair and will lead to dire consequences.
