I&#39;m a professionnal illustrator and concept artist working in the entertainment industry since 2015 and I&#39;m really worried about the future in this creative industry since AI technology was realeased publicly without any further precaution. Although I was interest in this technology since several years, once I understood how the algorithms was trained by scrapping billions of images and taking advantages of artist and people without even asking permission to use their work, I firmly rejected it vecause it feels so wrong to me ethically speaking. I found many of my work, personnal or professional, in the Laion database. Some of my clients have paid thousand of dollars in order to use this images. And this AI corporation can just take them and took advantages of them without even asking permission?  While it&#39;s not even possible to opt out of these database, I think the opt-in should be the norm. I don&#39;t see another way to seek consent of the concerned people. <br/>About copyright, my opinion is that using copyrighted image shouldn&#39;t be used to train AI unless the expressive consent of the owner. Using royalty free images, public domain art seems to be more fair while it&#39;s still need to be regulated. <br/>Also I think that image generated by AI should not benefit of copyright protection because the obtained result is strongly related to the input image used in the first place to &quot;train&quot; the algorithms. Without this massive theft of quality image in the first place, the results would be very dissapointing. The result obtained by this software is largely unpredictable : the user can ask, adjust things and re ask something like a client would do with the artist that is commissionned. <br/>I&#39;m also worry about people missinformed by fake images or videos in the future. It&#39;s becomming very difficult, event with an expert eye to differenciate AI or real photos and soon it would be almost impossible. That&#39;s why I also think that all of the text, or images generated by AI should expressively said that they are artifically generated.
