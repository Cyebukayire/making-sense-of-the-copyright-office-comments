I have submitted a comment each time comments have been requested. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone has even read them, but, if anyone is reading them, I ask that artist voices (like mine) be more heavily considered than those of AI entrepreneurs. AI can not be &ldquo;inspired,&rdquo; it can only be programs and reproduce what it has been show, even if the way it does so is not immediately recognized as theft. AI has been used time and time again to steal the work of artists (without permission, credit, or compensation) for profit (fiscal or otherwise) to the generator. AI should not have the ability to do that which a human artist can not&mdash;it can not plagiarize or &ldquo;transform&rdquo; another&rsquo;s work without credit, permission, and compensation. If I were to, for instance, write a book inspired by a popular franchise like Harry Potter where all of the characters are now firefighters, I could not publish and and profit off of this work without the credit, permission, and compensation of the copyright holder. This should not be different for AI. It especially should not be so for AI because there is no skill, thought, or artistic interpretation on the part of the AI in creating art&mdash;it would be theft for the sake of it. I do not intend to pursue art as a career, but I do intend to spend my adulthood in a world that recognizes and respects the rights of artists as both businesspeople and humans. Please, don&rsquo;t invalidate the years (sometimes even decades) of work artists have put into honing their craft by allowing AI &ldquo;artists&rdquo; to steal and profit from it in seconds.
