I am both a photographer and an artist who uses AI software to create images. I&#39;m glad that when photography was a new technology, no judge or federal agency decided that photographs were created by machines and not by people, and denied copyright protection to &quot;camera-generated&quot; images. With versatile open-source tools such as Stable Diffusion, AI image creation absolutely allows for as much human involvement as photography does.<br/><br/>You don&#39;t say that images created by a camera were just created by a machine, because, even if the camera were operating on a timer and left unattended when the image was taken, the human who set-up the camera was still creatively in charge of planning that image. The same is true for Generative AI software: Whether I start by giving it a sketch, a written prompt, or reference images, whether I set up nodes in an environment such as ComfyUI, or train a custom model, I&#39;m every bit as responsible for my AI generated images as I am for my photography. While new technologies are offering more tools to artists, allowing more people to explore more kinds of art, than ever before, no amount of technology will ever take away the obvious human artistry and responsibility in creating any man-made images.
