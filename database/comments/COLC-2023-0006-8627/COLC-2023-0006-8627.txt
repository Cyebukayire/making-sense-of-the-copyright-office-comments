Firstly, I would like to address the system as how generative AI is being produced/taught, which is the defining point on what would be considered legal copyright or not. Generative AI right now does not go through a system of consent form and is being taught with material that the original author did not consent to being used as learning material, along with it often being used to replace said artist with a cheaper method. That I would consider illegal, as the material was taken without consent, and the livelyhood of the artist being endangered through said theft. If the Generative AI is being taught on material that has been provided with consent, I would still not consider it to be legally copyright material, as the AI will use several pieces at once, thus resulting in several artists being the copyright holder at once.<br/>Furthermore I would like to address some systems that artists already put into place to prevent AI systems from illegally using their art as learning material, both glaze and nightshade are systems that allow artists to deny access to their art as learning material, thus revoking their consent towards a ethical generative system.<br/><br/>Coming from an artist, I myself wish to see protective measures and guidelines put in place to help artists keep their livelyhood side by side a generative system they can opt in and out from at any moment and not fear their work being stolen after simply posting their work online
