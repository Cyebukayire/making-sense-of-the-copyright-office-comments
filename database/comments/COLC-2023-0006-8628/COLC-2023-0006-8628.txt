The purpose of artificial intelligence should never be to replace humans, not in matters like art. Artists now have already been made to take matters into their own hands to protect their livelihood in the art field in forms such as Nightshade and other glazings of their digital work. Generative AI purely theft, and threatens the future of artists as companies fall back on AI instead of hiring human artists. There is currently no ethical way that AI can exist. Art made by AI is nothing but a lifeless copy of real work by real human artists. In this capitalistic society the risk of losing work to machine generated art is real and is already rearing its head. A person who writes strings of words into a machine is not an artist, and the images they generate are not art -- they have not MADE anything.<br/><br/>It&#39;ll be a grim world where art is no longer for humans.<br/><br/>If the US is willing to take a stance to protect the interests of human artists, it&#39;ll be a role model for others to follow.
