As it stands, anyone can create an AI model that:<br/>1. Uses my work to create necessarily derivative works without my consent (or often even knowledge)<br/>2. Uses my work to completely displace the market for my previous works (licensing)<br/>3. Uses my work to completely displace the market for me, the human behind the works (Commissions)<br/><br/>AI models are profitable only because of the works of artists used to train them, and given the massively adverse market effects on these human creators, their concerns should be addressed with greater priority than the tech companies behind AI, or the end users of AI, when their interests are at odds. There are a few ways we can start with this.<br/><br/>Mandate all AI be trained on Opt-In datasets. This has many advantages. By far the most important one is that the millions of artists who have published works would not need to track down every single opt-out form for the various companies. There is no universal opt-out form. there may be hundreds of different opt-out procedures for different companies and products. Opt-out is not a feasible system for artists to be able to keep track of, and that responsibility should not be forced upon them. Further, since Models cannont yet &#39;forget&#39; material, an Opt-in system is in fact necessary, as it can be paired with terms and conditions that ensure ownership and explicit permissions for submissions. Additionally, the works of the recently deceased, which are still protected many years after death, remain protected and ostensibly in the state where they were left in until copyright expires. <br/>To repeat: Opt-out does not work, and efforts that would go into a universal opt-out system are better spent on an opt-in system.<br/><br/>Voice cloning should be categorically outlawed without written permission from the owner of the voice, or an authority approved by them to license it. In those instances where it has been approved, Voices must be licensed on a per-project basis. The only conceivable instance where a specific voice is in fact necessary is deceit/impersonation. The benefits to voice cloning are so little and the risks are so great that the use of AI technology for the purpose must be heavily supervised. The same goes for visual likeness.<br/><br/>Commercial models must make their training datasets available to the public to ensure opt-in and appropriate use is enforceable. Where violations are found, damages must be paid in the form of compensation or algorithmic disgorgement.<br/><br/>AI generated content must be labeled as such, even where there is human editing afterwards, similar to classification markings, present on the content itself. Text might contain a disclosure in the headers and footers of any page. Video and audio might contain a brief statement at the start or end. Images might contain a watermark or other visible feature.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, benefits must be weighed against risks. The benefits of generative AI are negligible in the face of the catastrophic risks to privacy, identity, copyright, and public trust. No one should have to defend themselves against false recordings of their own voice. No one should be blackmailed by pornography featuring them but which never took place. No one should be at risk of having sensitive information ingested and regurgitated. The Government should not allow classified information to be ingest and regurgitated. Artists should not be forced to compete with a product developed using their own work. The public should not be forced to distrust every audio or video recording they see.<br/><br/>Thank you for seeking input on the matter
