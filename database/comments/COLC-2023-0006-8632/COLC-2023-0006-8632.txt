AI as it currently stands is completely unethical. It works by means of stealing work made by artists, writers and more, scraping them without any consent of the creator and using them to regenerate stolen content, which is then used without permission or compensation for the artists who&#39;s work was used to train it. There is no creativity there, no skill, and there is no protected rights there as none of it was made by a human. It was made by robot mashing together stolen, scraped content. AI is abhorrent and should be placed under strict legal guidelines so it isn&#39;t used to exploit real workers.
