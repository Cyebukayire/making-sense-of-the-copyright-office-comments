I would suggest that the simplest approach is the best - AI models are not people, thus cannot be true &#39;ex nihilo&#39; creators, and thus cannot receive copyright protections.  Even an AI model trained on public domain works is not an &#39;ex nihilo&#39; creator, because it can only operate within the bounds of the material on which it was trained; it is utterly dependent upon preexisting works.  For those same reasons, a human editing/modifying the output of an AI model should not be granted copyright protections on the resulting work, because they did not create said work, but merely edited it.
