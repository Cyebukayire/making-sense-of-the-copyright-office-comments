When market share that rightfully belongs to humans is lost to AI, wealth gets siphoned out of creative industries to tech companies. if left unregulated, a &#39;tragedy of the commons&#39; scenario is likely to ensue - granting copyright protection to AI would only hasten this outcome.<br/>This is where we are headed now (a simplified representation of the stages through which human art will eventually become devalued):<br/><br/>1. AI augments human art and increases productivity, providing a competitive advantage.<br/><br/>2. Excess of similar competition (businesses offering essentially the same products/services) leads to a saturated market -&gt; heightened barriers to entry, entry level jobs lost, reduced profit margins, difficulty gaining market share, dilution of brand identity and loss of customer loyalty -&gt; price wars begin.<br/><br/>3. Supply exceeds demand leading to a flooded market. This causes a chain rection: &#39;race to the bottom&#39; price wars -&gt; vicious cycle of devaluation -&gt; markets contract -&gt; creative industries begin collapsing -&gt; downstream businesses (which provide goods and services to the aforementioned) begin collapsing.<br/><br/>4. The balance of labor and capital shifts to capital and workers lose bargaining power -&gt; human creative labor is disincentivized -&gt; brain drain and talent flight -&gt; depletion and barrenness of the commons.<br/><br/>Link to an academic paper &quot;AI Art and its Impact on Artists&quot;<br/><br/>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681
