It is simple if the data base have direct copywriter material or machine derived of copyrighted material it shouldn&#39;t be eligible for copyright, an artist is not allowed to take some one&#39;s portfolio piece and add it to his own then copyright it. Why a machine should be allowed? If the database have only material owned by the company, public domain work and without second gen iterations to bypass legal terms then it could be eligible for copyright. The problem is not the technology but the way it is been used.
