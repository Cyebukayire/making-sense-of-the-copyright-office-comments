Every piece of artwork is derivative from works that have come before it. Lets say someone visits the Met. Afterwards, they return home and create a piece of artwork after being inspired by what they saw. If said person went home and created an exact replica of &quot;The Starry Night&quot; and tried to pass it off as their own, that&#39;s infringement quite clearly. However, if that person was inspired to paint their own post-impressionist landscape does that constitute theft in some way? Did Van Gogh infringe on C&eacute;zanne&#39;s copyright?<br/><br/>I fail to see how implementing a process that speeds up the interpretation of visual data is somehow in violation of the principles that govern freedom of expression. The process of training a model is not so different from someone visiting a museum, it is just done on a much larger scale. If I generated AI art inspired by &quot;The Starry Night&quot; is that any different than the example of the painter above? The method of creating the art has changed, but the principles should remain the same.<br/><br/>As a software developer, I fail to see why our medium for creating art is somehow under more scrutiny than those that have come before. Do we need different rules for oil paintings versus pencil art?
