Hello, I am a professional artist working in Video Games for the last 11 years. I work on 2D Art which is exactly why I&#39;m so impacted by the rise of unethical AI technology. I believed that the only way forward with this technology is to totally erase the database of images that they all use, and start over from scratch, getting permission from each and every image owner.<br/><br/>Currently those AI art companies blatantly STOLE millions of images from artists such as myself. It&#39;s theft gone unpunished, pure and simple. Their entire business model is hoping that artists don&#39;t stand up for themselves and their rights. <br/><br/>Please make this technology illegal and shut these companies down. If they get permission from each copyright holder with a re-built database then they can proceed, but that is the only possible way forward for them.<br/><br/>Their business is truly an evil one, preying on the vulnerable, capitalizing on millions of artist&#39;s hard work over their lifetimes - doing it quickly so no one notices.<br/><br/>To reiterate, this business practice is as extremely unethical and morally vile. Destroy these companies and set laws in place that are harsh enough to deter anyone from trying this again.<br/><br/>Thank you.
