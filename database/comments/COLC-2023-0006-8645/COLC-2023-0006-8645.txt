The Ai movement Is a financial terroristical machine that Is going to treaten democracy on multiple levels .<br/>The One I am most focus on Is the private propriety of artist of each kind and type. <br/>Fundational models ,aka &quot;AI&quot;, are a PARASSITIC  tool that steal from other private propriety to re-use It without playing or aknowledging the use and the terrorists at the wheel of this machine are trying to cut out artist with this exploit and you Need also to conaider that the AI movement Is global and it&#39;s Highly unlilely that the AI companies Will pay any taxes .<br/>Millions of artista Will end up in the streets as homeless , that May be an exageration but do you know how many jobs Will disappear and how few Will be created ? It&#39;s a deeply anti-human movement that takes arts that are the biggeat aspirations of the human species and make their pursue as a career impossible , therefore it&#39;s a movement with the main focus on killing art, knoweldge and pretty much everything that distinguiamo us from beasts.<br/>I beh you to protect us , we are only the First to get hit , school are next and the democracy afterward no matter how much you protect your government if you take away art and the highway human aspiration you Will kill the human thoughts .<br/>
