AI work is entirely generated by a computer, unlike with digital art, which still requires a skilled author&#39;s hand. By allowing the copyright of AI work, hundreds of thousands of artists, both small and large, will immediately be out of work. In precedent set by Naruto v. David Slater et all, it is ruled that non-humans cannot hold copyrigh. All non human art is public domain, by that logic. AI art is not made by humans, it is made by AI. Therefore, it is not possible for AI art to be copyrightable by humans.
