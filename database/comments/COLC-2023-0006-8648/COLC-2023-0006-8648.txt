ML/AI models are created by converting intellectual property into numbers and then using an algorithm to process those numbers into an output. Just because the &quot;training data&quot; is discarded afterwards does not make it not an input into a ML model. Machine learning models like DALL-E are made of two inputs - the original training data and the prompts. Therefore the copyright of the original training data must be protected, machine learning output is not truly independently created material.
