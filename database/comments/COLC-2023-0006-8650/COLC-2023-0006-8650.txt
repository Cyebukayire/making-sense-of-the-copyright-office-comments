AI left unchecked has the ability to make development of intellectual property obsolete. All great art, literature, music, is in danger of being driven extinct. It sounds ridiculous but look at photos that have been altered to insert people who weren&rsquo;t there. Right now it&rsquo;s relatively easy to see the fakes. Eventually that won&rsquo;t be the case. So without stringent regulation and punishment for misuse is dangerous. But consider all the beauty and nuance lost if AI is allowed to take over. <br/><br/>AI can be a tremendous asset in certain areas but it needs to be forced to stay in its lane and only through appropriate regulation can that be accomplished.
