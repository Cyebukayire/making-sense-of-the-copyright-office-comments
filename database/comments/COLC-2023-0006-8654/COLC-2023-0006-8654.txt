Many people will claim that &quot;AI&quot; generative art is a tool for lowering the barrier of entry of for artists. That it&#39;s largely harmless and the natural progression of technological advancement in the art space. But that is a misdirect from the problem at hand. If an artist wanted to supply these generative algorithms with their own art and produce new works I see no problem. Instead what is done is these people, these companies, are building databases of art made by other people and using that to replicate those works using these generative models with no compensation to those original artists. It is a purely parasitic process that aims to replace the very foundation on which it is built.<br/>People will also claim that generative art &quot;isn&#39;t good enough to replace actual artists anyway&quot;. But I implore you to remember that it is the worst it will ever be right now. It will only ever get more adept at stealing and replicating. We already sometimes cannot tell what is or isn&#39;t &quot;AI&quot; art.<br/>More nefarious people have taken to use these generators to fake propaganda of real world events, or pornography of real people, or speech and video of political leaders. I&#39;m not going to pretend that a copyright law will help prevent people from doing nefarious things, but it can help in limiting who has access to the tools for the crime.
