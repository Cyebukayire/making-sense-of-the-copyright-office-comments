AI generated artwork should never be allowed to be copyrighted or sold when it is unethically made. These generated images are generating billions of dollars on the hard work of so many artists who have decades of experience and hard work. The artists who&rsquo;s work are  included in these data sets should be compensated for damages and moving forward AI companies should not use images unless given permission.
