&quot;AI art&quot; is stealing content in front of everyone, most Tech people rather spoil everything rather than actually letting people enjoy their craft and learning the skills required to be an artist. AI isn&#39;t about making life easier for artist. If art as a craft  dies, then the entertainment industry will take a blow, and since the dawn of time, people need quality entertainment/art.
