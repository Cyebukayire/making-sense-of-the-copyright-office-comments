Hi - I am a Los Angeles-based screenwriter working in television writers rooms. I believe your office should mandate an extremely high standard for whether or not you can copyright AI generated art or text. I think it should be highly constrained because you&#39;re really just remixing the underlying training data. Equally importantly: training an AI on a writer&#39;s (or artist&#39;s or actor&#39;s or musician&#39;s) work should be prohibited without full consultation, meaningful consent, and generous compensation via a negotiated, fully informed OPT IN license with the writer/artist themselves. And that includes cases of work for hire.  In that case the training right should be retained by the original author.
