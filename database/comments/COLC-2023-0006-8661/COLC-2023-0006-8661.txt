The AI executive order - just saw a notice of it being published - nowhere do I see protections for artists/creatives (the first victims)   -- from AI tech - currently stealing from artists as I type - Stability; Midjourney and a host of others <br/><br/>Europe seems to have covered this for artists<br/>We need the same in the US<br/><br/>What is the point of millions of artists (taxpayers and voters) who have already given submissions about all the harm done to them<br/> - if they are going to be ignored ??<br/><br/>The harm to artists and the method of stealing has been well and truly documented - its not like no one knows at this point<br/><br/>Just curious why no protection <br/><br/>Its not just artists - its the domino effect - artists  license to BIG US companies; stores etc -<br/>Said companies legitimately license from artists <br/>Allowing stealing from artists - is allowing stealing from above companies; their employees who depend on them; their vendors etc<br/><br/>Are huge US companies/ manufacturers/ retailers - the list goes on -  not important also ??<br/><br/>
