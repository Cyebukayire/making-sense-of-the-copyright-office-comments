As a graphic designer and advertising copywriter with over 20 years experience in the field, I am strongly opposed to the way generative AI platforms are scraping the web and stealing/copying existing creative works. It would be wrong for an AI to read &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; and then proceed to write a new novel in the same style as Ernest Hemingway. It should be considered similarly wrong for an AI to read website copy, ads, blog articles, etc and copy them in a certain style. Anything that a creator publishes, whether graphic design, written copy, videos, animation, illustration, photography etc. should be considered protected work under copyright law. We, as artists, should be asked to &quot;opt in&quot; to &quot;training&quot; (stealing) AI software, instead of the reverse. Right now, those of us with public portfolios are risking having our work stolen or copied for the sake of AI &quot;learning&quot; how to generate images, when it fact it is mostly copying the hard work of those who came before. Generative AI should be heavily regulated in the same way that video and published work piracy is considered a crime, so should this.
