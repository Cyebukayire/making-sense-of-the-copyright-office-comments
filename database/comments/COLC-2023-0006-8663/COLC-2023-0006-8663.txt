Hello, and thank you for your time. I am a currently unemployed concept artist who formerly worked for a mobile game company. We had a strict &#39;no AI to final&#39; policy, (namely because of the copyright concern) but in order to keep up with growing tech, had started implementing it into our routine. I and my peers repeatedly expressed concerns. 1.) they were comparing our short times worth of work to essentially a collage of polished finished pieces from art that took the creators months, years, and an entire team in some cases. ( for example a character composed with the prompts &#39;Disney&#39; &#39;3D&#39; &#39;isometric&#39; &#39;cute&#39; ) and insisting that we needed to work faster and reach the level of polish that the computer example did. Which isn&#39;t possible, even for the computer who is simply plagiarizing other works to make this one. In other words it was setting unrealistic expectations for our art team. 2.) It wasn&#39;t ours. It&#39;s completely compromised of stolen. Not borrowed artwork. ergo using it as a starting point was not exactly intelligent. 3.) It was beginning to cut the amount of work we were given in half. A few of our peers noted that they were getting fewer projects and assignments.  When we asked our leaders about this we were informed that AI is a tool. That it wont replace us. That it is giving us &#39;more work&#39; by making it easier to do the small things.  Two weeks after meeting with my art director about this, the ENTIRE creative department of the USA DDI studio was cut. Even my art director lost his job. We are seeing AI replace human thought at an alarming rate. I do support technology. I do not support a plagiarism machine that has gathered information and uses it only according to it&#39;s programmers moral code. I do not think AI is inherently evil or malicious in any way. I simply think AI is doing what it was designed to do. That being said, it&#39;s growth rate is not something we can just ignore. Look at the mass layoffs in the game industry that are crushing the tech industry right now. If people don&#39;t have jobs, they can&#39;t spend money and feed any economic growth. This is not fear talking, this is anger at being plagiarized without consent- at the dangers posed by impersonation, and misinformation. That is not a power I want to see go unrestricted. Jobs will grow until they are replaced. if you look at the job market ( i can only speak for my field) all I am seeing are senior roles, lead roles. no one is hiring for junior or mid level. Where does that leave our next generation? I don&#39;t believe it leaves them anywhere, and I think that is entirely the intention. Teach the AI through Veteran artists that have high performance rates- learn their processes, so you don&#39;t need them anymore, so when they retire, voila you have duplicates ala AI. It will grow and grow until we no longer need prompts. Even now prompts grew from being EXTREMELY specific to only needing the slightest amount of detail provided to form a passable image. And this is putting good people out of jobs. This is duplicating actor likeness and dropping them in movies as extras without the original actors consent. This is using the voice of MLK Jr. to say awful things. This is harmless activity turning very very quickly into danger. You stop a petty thief. Per the law. The law should still be upheld. the information AI is using was gathered illegally in many cases, without consent in many more, without knowledge in most. Perhaps, if we apply the proper laws and restrictions now, we can make AI less harmful and more useful as it was originally intended to be. A tool replacement. Not the Factory replacement. Thank you for your time.
