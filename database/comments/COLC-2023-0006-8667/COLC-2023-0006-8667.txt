Hi there I&#39;m David. <br/>A young aspiring artist.<br/><br/>Let get straight to the point, Ai art is theft. <br/>Well multiple different artists and graphic designers have been lay off due to cost and expenses, Companies always want the cheaper route to save money and time. AI is just faster and cheaper due to not acquiring any interaction with artists/designers.<br/>AI is built on data that scan through the Internet and collect. It use the collected data from artists to mash up ai generated images without permission and consent from artists. It nearly impossible to protect our work from ai due not enough legislation protecting the right of artists. That way we need Nightshade and Glaze to protect our work from the pesky ai from stealing from us. <br/><br/>I hope this comment helps out to know what is happening to us artists and graphic designers.<br/>
