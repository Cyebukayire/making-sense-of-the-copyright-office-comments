So called AI completely dismantles Copyright. <br/><br/>I can not protect myself or claim protection against AI ingestion or &quot;training&quot; - As it is called in order to humanize programs and dehumanize the actual people who&#39;s work is being exploited. <br/><br/>Companies like Adobe, to pick an example to illustrate, already decided that AI ingestion absolutely devalues any labor of the people who unwillingly contribute to their commercial company-AI, paying out fractions of fractions of cents to actual creative workers. No chance of protection or negotiation, Adobe just decides that several hours of work, used in perpetuity is worth a one time payment of maybe 0,0003 Cent. This is simply exploitation and perverse. Should the copyright owner, the original creator not have the right to decide how their work can be used and what sort of compensation would be adequate? <br/>And there is also no chance to reverse the use in an AI database, as there is no deletion of data from a model. <br/>So: No choice, no compensation and no value of work and perpetual complete exploitation.<br/><br/>The claim of Fair-Use is ridiculous. AI &quot;training&quot; uses whole works and masses of them. Supposedly in order to claim Fair-Use, the use of someone else&#39;s work has to be deliberate and minimal. How can that apply when whole works are being ingested? Why the aimless ingestion of all sort of works? <br/><br/>AI in this way simply strips all Copyright protections from creators and completely devalues their work. Personally, I will not share any creations anymore, there is no reason to. This AI plague is hostile to new ideas, as everything is vacuumed up and absolutely devalued. I have seen many people disappear from creative communities, in a way I did the same. Why create or share ideas? You will just be used and replaced by a probability algorithm which is feed with your labor. It completely freezes out new ideas, new developments and ideas. Why put any work into something new, there will just be this new form of piracy called AI waiting. <br/><br/>A program is not a person. <br/>And a person is in no way analogous to a program.<br/>A program does not learn. It can not be acceptable to claim that a program just &quot;learns&quot; by &quot;looking&quot; at material. This is dehumanizing. <br/>Creators must be protected from any and all AI ingestion by default. Use of creations of AI needs to be illegal if not licensed or allowed. There can be no use of something in an AI database forever. Since those programs can not delete something from their database, the whole corrupted and illegal database has to be deleted in that case. The fact that no one specific thing can be deleted is deliberate and has to be ignored. Those AI developers decided to make deletion impossible and to use stolen works at the same time. The burden can not be placed on the victims who&#39;s work has been stolen. <br/>AI databases have to be open and transparent, so copyright owners can see if their work is being used without license.<br/><br/>Overall, I do not see why mass us of copyrighted material as business assets has any sort of questions behind it. This is use of protected material in an unlawful way on a mass scale. Where is the issue, except with the marketing terms of AI developers? AI is not intelligent. It is an algorithm jumbling together material based on calculations of probability. AI is a marketing term. It is algorithmic generation.<br/>Calling this AI is again, to claim sentient or intelligence for a program, to cover up this mass theft of copyrighted material, of labor, in programs that are actively destroying the market of those people, the developers are exploiting, stealing from. How is the direct destruction of market value of the ingested creative works Fair-Use? <br/><br/>AI is a filter to wash away all Copyright with no protection against it. Effectively making ALL Copyright laws obsolete an completely useless.<br/><br/>Unless a program is not a person.
