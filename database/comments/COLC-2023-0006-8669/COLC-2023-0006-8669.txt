Hi! I&#39;m Tam! A digital artist from California. AI image, text, video, and audio generation, as it currently stands, is made by scraping copyrighted content off the internet without the consent of the copyright holders. The image, text, video and audio generation models currently in use are built off of this scraped content and require it to work. I ask that the US copyright office require all existing and future AI models to be built off of content that is licensed/consented to be used. Be that public domain content, or licensed content. Scraping content to be inserted into AI models is a breach of copyright. Especially because these AI content generators seek to replace and/or minimize the need for human-made content.
