Greetings,<br/><br/>I am a professional, internationally published and licensed artist. My work has been published in multiple languages and on numerous products. This is how I make my living and pay my taxes. As such I see that allowing AI full copyright would be detrimental to the lives of countless artists across all fields. <br/><br/>Precedence has already been set in numerous companies for AI to take over jobs, a large one being customer service. Replacing people with tech is a growing industry and one that is likely to continue. Many various companies have already expressed wanting to use AI to replace the artists that they currently employ and pay, as we saw with the recent writers strike. Companies who create products and entertainment would no longer require artists to design the items, entertainment, or the art that is featured on these products because they could have a program generate images or designs. Programs that wouldn&rsquo;t exist without artists in the first place. This would be especially prevalent in the mid level sectors where the bulk of artists and designers are employed, as companies see cutting jobs and replacing people with programs as a great way to cut costs. This is already a difficult field to get into and takes years of work and practice. Despite what many think being an artist isn&rsquo;t a talent, it is a skill that needs to be nurtured and developed. Many artists are in deep debt from college loans and classes trying to improve their craft and I firmly believe that copyrights grants and ownerships are one of the few things making it possible for artists to hang onto the jobs they have as companies don&rsquo;t want to use programs that would not allow copyrights of their Intellectual Properties and designs. <br/><br/>Personally I have seen a steady drop on my sales both online and in person, and I do believe this is partly from AI. Commissions have almost completely dried up as privately people no longer need or want to hire artists to see their own visions come to life, and my social media engagement is almost non-existent because sites like instagram and Facebook are over saturated with AI content. Many of these wouldn&rsquo;t be affected by copyright but my licensing contracts would and this is one of the few places I am still earning my living. I have already heard that copyrights are one of the few things holding some of these companies accountable to continue licensing artwork from artists. <br/><br/>I have wanted to be a full time artist since the age of 8. It is the only thing I have focused my life&rsquo;s work on, and for the last several years and it has allowed me to live my life fairly comfortably. I know several artists who are in the same position. Not allowing AI copyright status truly is one of the last hopes many of us have in keeping our jobs and lifestyles. I implore you to keep the laws as they are and only grant copyrights to humans so that humans can continue to live and work.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration, <br/>Carla Morrow
