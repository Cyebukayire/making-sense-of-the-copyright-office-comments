Absolutely think any image made by ai needs to clearly state it was made by ai, ideally programs that make it will just caption the picture automatically to denote it as an ai image.<br/><br/>Scraping of images or other information for AI should always be on an opt in basis. Currently companies either aren&#39;t asking or are operating on an opt out option. If someone wants to train AI on their own data that should be fine but we shouldn&#39;t expect everyone to need to opt out just so their work isn&#39;t stolen and used without their consent.<br/><br/>AI should be a tool people can choose to employ on their own and not a necessity mandated by the company they work for. No company should be allowed to force workers to use AI with the excuse that it will speed up workflow. And if employees do use AI they and the company should need to report it was part of their work and be transparent in how it was used and to what degree.
