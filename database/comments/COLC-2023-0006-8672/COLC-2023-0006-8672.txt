We have to stop putting machines over humans when it comes to creative fields, humans make laws for humans and the entertainment industry is already saturated, if people used all their time to consume the entertainment they like they wouldn&#39;t be able to consume everything in their lifetime already, now multiply the output of the industry by hundreds of times with everything filled with AI and the industry will just fall apart, what&#39;s the point of making art at that stage? All of this is happening while artists are underpaid and mocked, why change something for the worst? Value human creation, stop AI from advancing or it will be too late until people realize all the consequences that happened.
