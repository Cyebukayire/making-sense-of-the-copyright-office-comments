Generative AI images while often said to learn like human, cannot make personal choice. It took many artist&#39;s works without consent to be used as copying material. With Glaze, artists make their work excluded from scraping because it&#39;s labeled as inaccurate data, and with Nightshade, artist could allow their work to be scraped but ruining the learning capabilities of the AI. The argument that AI learns like a human is then proven invalid with this as human would still be able to describe clearly the image seen.<br/><br/>Generating images with AI and claiming it as their work is like customizing your meal in a diner then calling yourself a chef. You might need to learn the language and terminology necessary to communicate your wants, but that&#39;s just like everyone else ordering food or buying stuff in countries that don&#39;t speak your first language. At the end of the day your food/art is produced by someone else and therefore not for the client to copyright
