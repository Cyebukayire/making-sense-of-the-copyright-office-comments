I have a degree in music composition. I have several completed recordings of original compositions that I have hesitated to publish (for one year) because of generative AI. I&#39;m lucky I didn&#39;t publish them before, and they haven&#39;t been used to &ldquo;train&rdquo; existing AI models. Still, existing procedures discourage me from ever publishing. Large music companies are fighting AI companies, but they&#39;re not helping me. UMG has bragged about using AI, for instance to release 1 song in several languages. This is accepted because they don&#39;t publish the AI models, but it is a threat to many who could work in music.<br/><br/>8.3<br/>&ldquo;How should the fair use analysis apply if AI models or datasets are later adapted for use of a commercial nature&rdquo;<br/><br/>There is no &ldquo;if&rdquo; here. Prohibiting unauthorized &ldquo;training&rdquo; for commercial use but allowing it for research creates a market for this, and it will be done in an organized way.<br/>Sharing copyrighted works for free still hurts the author. It creates competition for copyright owners, as it undersells everyone: it&#39;s not possible for an author to beat the price of free. Why should AI models be different? Sharing a model for free affects me even more.<br/><br/>9.1. <br/>&ldquo;Should consent of the copyright owner be required for all uses of copyrighted works to train AI models or only commercial uses? &ldquo;<br/><br/>I object to people copying my work and distributing the result for free.<br/><br/>9.3<br/>&ldquo;What legal, technical, or practical obstacles are there to establishing or using such a process? Given the volume of works used in training, is it feasible to get consent in advance from copyright owners?&ldquo;<br/><br/>Laziness and greed are the obstacles.<br/>The volume of works used is NOT a given. It is controlled by developers, and their needs are not above the law.<br/><br/>13<br/>&ldquo;What would be the economic impacts of a licensing requirement on the development and adoption of generative AI systems?&rdquo;<br/><br/>This industry has existed for a few years. Humanity has survived for over 100,000 years without this. What &ldquo;economic impact&rdquo;?<br/><br/>14<br/>&ldquo;Please describe any other factors you believe are relevant with respect to potential copyright liability for training AI models.&ldquo;<br/><br/>Potential, possibilities<br/>The possibilities that exist in text, software, images, video, audio and music are exactly the same in a world with generative AI as in a world without it. People could already create anything. The difference is efficiency: the ability to remove talented people from the process. This is not a right and not needed.<br/>Self-checkout lanes don&#39;t provide a new service. Nor automated restaurants, robot vacuum cleaners, or mobile banking. Unlike generative AI, none of these depend on unauthorized copying. The obvious advantage is the ability to save money by not paying a person. For all of the &ldquo;advances&rdquo; and &ldquo;astonishing&rdquo; things being &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; with generative AI, it does not create new possibilities. People make money by creating AI models, and people save money by using them, but that money does not come from nowhere; it is money not being paid to talented people able to create those works.<br/><br/>Terminology<br/>Artificial neural networks were inspired by neurons. But they are still variables stored in RAM; binary representations of values, stored with electronic components. AI models are software. They use the same instructions and logic gates that programmable computers always use. The terminology invites equivocation: &ldquo;train&rdquo;, &ldquo;learn&rdquo;, &ldquo;read&rdquo;, &ldquo;ingest&rdquo;, &ldquo;infer&rdquo;, &ldquo;scrape&rdquo;. AKA programming, running algorithms, and copying; this is what they mean. Inside the computer are no neurons.<br/>Please be careful using these metaphors officially. Training, learning, studying, reading, ingesting, inferring, and scraping are all actions we do every day, not illegal or questionable. But, in generative AI, the human actions are copying, running programs (&ldquo;weights&rdquo; are crucial to any &ldquo;trained&rdquo; model, but are not authored by developers) and programming. Why should a new kind of algorithm that still uses these &ndash; and which produces no new possibilities in the arts &ndash; change the meaning of all of these words and skirt the existing rules?<br/><br/>Non-professionals<br/>I&#39;m not an established artist, but have devoted many sleepless nights, 4 years of college and a lot of work to perfecting my skills. If only established artists benefit from copyright protection against AI &ldquo;training,&rdquo; truly creative artists and authors will suffer. Franz Kafka and Van Gogh were not professionals, but their works are essential. Not all great artists are professional. Please consider that any standards regarding using copyrighted work in generative AI must protect and encourage all creative, talented people; not only industries.
