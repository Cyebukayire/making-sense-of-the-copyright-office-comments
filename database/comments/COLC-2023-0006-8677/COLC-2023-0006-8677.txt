AI art without proper regulation and copyright laws is already negatively impacting artists and their livelihood. If things do not change, this will eventually lead to a noticeable loss of creative works as human artists will not be able to sustain themselves and will need to turn to other venues for money. Regulations must be put in place to protect human art from being used in AI generative models without the artist&#39;s consent, and to protect artists from style mimicry. The same can be said for writing models, as well as AI voice models, as these impact writers and voice actors as well.
