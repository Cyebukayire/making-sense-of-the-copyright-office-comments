To Whom It May Concern,<br/><br/>The rapid development of artificial intelligence (A.I.) poses an existential threat to the livelihoods of many sectors of the American economy. The one I can speak truest to is that of those in creative professions. Far too many of these A.I. generation platforms have been train on illegally scrapped datasets of the original work of throusand of artists and writers, without their knowledge, consent, or fair compensation.<br/><br/>Not only should these datasets be thoroughly purged of illegally obtained work, they should be penalized for violating the copyrights of countless protected works, strict enforcement of copyright protections must be enacted, and under no cicumstances should any work generated by A.I. qualify for copyright protection. Failure to do so will ensure the rapid decay of nearly all creative industries, jeopardizing millions of jobs and billions of dollars.
