&quot;AI&quot;-generated content should not be allowed to be trained on copyrighted material, not without asking for explicit permission or compensation. It should be obligatory to OPT-IN, similar to when websites ask for permission to use cookies, otherwise, it would not matter if you opted-out as the AI models would have already been trained on your material, not to mention the difficulties of opting-out, with such option partially hidden in some niche place of the website. The datasets they use to train their models should be public in order for artists, authors, researchers, etc to properly examine and check if their material has been put in there. Asking the removal of such materials, while useful and welcome, is useless as the &quot;AI&quot; has already been trained on it, and by eliminating it, the machine doesn&#39;t magically unlearn it. It is why OPT-IN is so important and the ethical way.<br/> <br/>&quot;AI&quot;-generated content should not receieve copyright protection (specially when there&#39;s no human input). It is not actual Artifitial Intelligence, it does not think like a us humans nor is it concious to make decisions, it&#39;s machine learning. It is trained, as of now, on scrapped data without explicit permission, compensation and, in most cases, with no option to even opt-out (in many wepsites, it is directly assumed as a &quot;yes&quot; in their Terms of Use by merely using it, thus robbing their users of their freedom of choice). Such AI generated content, created from scrapped data, is directly used to compete with creators in the market and to impersonate them. It&#39;s dishonest competition. It floods the market in artifitial sludge, devaluating the products and their cultural value and, as consecuence, less economical gain honest creators can earn to sustain themselves. Not granting &quot;AI&quot;-generated content copyright protection would deter companies from taking advantage of it and from firing their employees, increasing unemployment, concentrating richness even more to a few individuals.<br/><br/> You can see people&#39;s opinion on that through, as of now, the current SAG-AFTRA&#39;s workers strike and the previous one by the WGA, which among many things, are asking for protections against being substitued by &quot;AI&quot; programs. The Hollywood studios are not full-on substituing as many workers as they want because right now, &quot;AI&quot;-generated content cannot be granted copyright protection. Lots of online artists are using programs such as Glaze or the upcoming Nightshade, both developed by the University of Chicago, as measures of protections or straight up are deleting their work from websites and social media.<br/><br/>I am not very good forming good arguments and I think this paper by actual professionals is much better explaining my points: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681
