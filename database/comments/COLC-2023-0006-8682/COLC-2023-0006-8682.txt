Iam an illustrator, designer and lecturer at different universities in Germany. Iam into AI since 2012 and visited several lectures and conferences on the topic during the last years. I turned more and more critical towards generative AI during the last 2 years. Right now I allready see other artists, loosing jobs to generative AI which where trained on their Data through adagencies and other individuals. I follow closely, what the copyright office is doing and think there is some good development. This topic should be dealt with on an international level. The reason, why Iam mostly sceptical against generative AI is, that it is the first technology, that interferes with our way of thinking in a diminishing way. Right now Iam working on an art project, where I let a conditioned animal create art through generative AI and it works quite well. AI is taking decisions and the more decisions an artists gives away, the less of copyright he/she should get for the resulting work. Copyright (or the German Urheberrecht) should enable cultural flourishment. Generative AI is messing with cultural techniques from reading and writing to drawing and thinking in images. <br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Tobias W&uuml;stefeld
