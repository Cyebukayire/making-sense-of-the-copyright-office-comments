Short and simple. generative AI for art is just blatant theft of millions of artists&#39; work without any compensation. If you take away the human element, there is nothing the generative AI can pull from. It cannot create it&#39;s own art from it&#39;s own imagination. The government should be protecting individual&#39;s rights vs a corporation&#39;s.
