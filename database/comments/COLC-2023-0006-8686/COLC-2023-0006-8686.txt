Generative AI does not &quot;generate&quot; anything by itself. It can&#39;t function without sampling (stealing) from existing works created by humans, most of whom did not consent to having their work used.<br/><br/>To protect their work, artists have resorted to using Glaze and Nightshade to throw off AI models trying to sample it.<br/><br/>We should not allow companies and individuals to profit from AI-generated works that pull their data indiscriminately from various online sources where users have not explicitly consented to having their work used. That&#39;s plagiarism.
