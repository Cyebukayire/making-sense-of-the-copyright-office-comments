I believe that something has value when effort and skill are applied. It&rsquo;s the reason why a work of art is called a &ldquo;work&rdquo;. Effort and skill was exerted thus giving it value. Using Ai is like tracing someone else&rsquo;s work but worse. The least amount of effort possible is applied and there is no skill gained or used. It is worthless and overall theft. So no, I don&rsquo;t believe it is deserving of  copyright. In fact I think it shouldn&rsquo;t be legal to use in production or studios at all.
