Copyright is foundational in creative work. It attaches as soon as the work is set in a tangible form, and it guarantees the copyright holder the right to make copies of that work. Under US copyright law, no one else can make a copy of that work (or a part of it) without the copyright holder&#39;s permission. The tech companies behind AI generative software completely ignored that law when they populated their training data by scraping the internet for content. They didn&#39;t ask anyone for permission to use their text, photographs, artwork, music, videos, social media posts -- anything. They used these works without permission to create software that can reproduce and create derivative works from them. This is already causing real-world harm. Creative professionals are losing income to AI software. Their work is being stolen from them and recreated by a machine, while the companies behind the software make money by selling subscriptions to use it.<br/>Beyond that, AI generative software as it&#39;s currently implemented could lead to a chilling effect on art, as fewer creatives put their work online. The AI software will just keep churning out more and more of the same old thing, because it lacks the ability for true creativity and ingenuity -- it&#39;s only as good as the work scraped into its dataset. Human artists will lose the ability to reach a wider audience through the internet, and the world as a whole will lose getting to see those works. It&#39;ll put us back to a time where the only people who get to see new and innovative art are those lucky enough to be able to go to museums and art galleries. More rural communities -- and the future artists that might have come from them -- will be left behind.<br/>Without regulations to keep AI generative software in check, we&#39;re already seeing deep fakes. We&#39;ve seen the harm that misinformation can cause. AI generative software makes it so much easier to create and spread that. Requiring AI software companies to abide by copyright law is one tool to protect against that.<br/>We&#39;ve seen this before, with Napster. Even though AI generative software &quot;remixes&quot; the copyrighted work into a derivative work, that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t violating copyright. For one thing, they&#39;re both built on the same thing -- copying creative work without permission. Just as the Napster decision rightly held that file-sharing without permission violated copyright, so too does software companies scraping content from the internet without the copyright holders&#39; permission.<br/>Napster was taken down, and the streaming services that we have today eventually emerged, where artists OPT IN to having their work on the service and are paid royalties for it. The same needs to be done with AI generative software. The current training data and datasets need to be deleted, and new ones created using only work where the copyright owners have opted in to it.<br/>And it definitely needs to be opt-in, NOT opt-out. Copyright law has always maintained that the person or entity wanting to use a copyrighted work must ask for permission. It&#39;s never been that they can use it unless the copyright holder finds out and tells them to stop. The same as if you wanted to use someone&#39;s car. Doing it without permission is theft. And using copyrighted work without permission is stealing, too.
