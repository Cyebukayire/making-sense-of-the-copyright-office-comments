Artificial Intelligence is a Trojan Horse of future problems regarding copyright infringement and originality. When a machine can comb data banks and steal imagery the whole idea of artist, machine art and copyrights will collapse into a gray zone. Traditionally handmade art has had the benefit of being protected. But can we say that a machine is blameless? AI is eye candy heroin. It WILL engulf all other arts unless restricted. Elon Musk was right in stating that I could potentially destroy civilization. And that&#39;s not an exaggeration. Extrapolating the speed of its advance into the social and business sectors, in due time it will rule over us in some technofascist police state. American independence would cease to exist. As an artist, I urge you to stop this Frankenstein before it&#39;s too late.
