I think we already have the framework in place to deal with these copyright claims. What can I do legally as a person with photoshop? What can I not do legally as a person with photoshop? AI image generation is just a new way of generating images. Why does it matter that it was produced with the assistance of AI? Because people feel threatened by the scale at which AI can produce content, that&#39;s why. If there is a case for changing fair use laws because of AI it is because the law does not scale correctly. I think it does. A person using AI to generate content is the same as a person using any other software to generate content. Existing law already exists to govern it.
