AI is a collage of stolen art. It provides nothing new. Collages are meant to create something new with items sourced ethically - newspapers from a trashcan, art from a garage sale, feathers from under a nest - not to be taken from people whose heart was poured into something just to be shoved through a meat grinder and spit out as &quot;cute girl Disney style posing backwards with hands on hips.&quot; It is an infringement on copyright, replaces jobs in the industry that are valuable and full of heart, and takes another step towards the dystopian future where machine replaces man. Letting people sell AI art is the same as letting people sell the skin off someone&#39;s back.
