To the U.S. Copyright Office:<br/><br/>Generative Artificial Intelligence poses an existential threat for the lives of millions of creatives. As we have seen time and time again, it is the corporate capitalist (let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s an oligarchy) prerogative to squeeze blood from the stone. Once it becomes cost effective, AI will quickly replace human jobs.<br/><br/>This is a detriment for many reasons. Not only will AI supplant the careers of millions of creative writers, artists, musicians, and more, but a mass acceptance of AI as an acceptable proxy for the human experience is a huge affront to the human species. Once AI overtakes marketing, film, books, TV, streaming, etc., we will no longer be participants in observing and reporting our human condition; we will be simple receivers. This makes it possible for people to be manipulated, for copyright to be infringed, and for a vastly compromised legal system. How can we possibly compete in ideation with computers that are designed to outthink us? What is to stop an AI computer from filing copyright on every idea possibly known to man and then the owner of that AI suing authors who later come up with the idea for infingement? Not only should AI not be allowed to be used AS copyrighted material, given that it is not INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, but we have to make sure that AI, like corporations, is not eventually given better rights than the ordinary citizen. We&#39;ve seen how this works. The Supreme Court is stacked with corrupt sycophants, corporations own politicians, and the law applies to only the wealthiest. What happens when AI overtakes this entire system? Will it mimic its creators in blanket injustice? Or will it seek out higher moral purpose? The bottom line is that we should not be Gods to some unhinged technology, given that we are so incapable of taking care of ourselves.
