It&#39;s hard to find anything to say that hasn&#39;t been said over and over. While the comparison of prompting to commissioning work sets a good example of how to handle copyright there is a deeper issue to generated work. For every argument that follows the conflicted legitimacy of AI work the overshadowing problem is almost always disregarded. Generative AI models are built on the collection and use of unlicensed copyright work and then sold as a product. Anything produced by these models is irrelevant as the source is already infringing on the rights of creatives and their work. Any other product designed and sold using copyright work without the rights to do so would be in blatant violation. These generative models are no different, much of the argument in favor would site transformative work or parody as a defense but data laundering is an equally accurate description. The decision on copyright protection for laundered data is going to set a precedent far beyond simply images, music, books and voices. Many of the companies creating these models have already scraped personal information, medical records and illicit material. Until this practice is dealt with and these models created with proper oversight any legitimacy, especially copyright, will cause massive harm to everyone except those befitting directly from this exploitation.
