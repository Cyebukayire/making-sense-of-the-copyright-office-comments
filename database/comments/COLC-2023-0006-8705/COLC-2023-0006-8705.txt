I hope the United States copyright office does not allow art and prose generated by generative Ai and stolen from artists and writers to gain copyright protection. I applaud the creation of apps like Nightshade by Glaze to protect artists from the illegal use of their art to &ldquo;create&rdquo; new works. As someone who supports artists directly, and is beginning my art journey as well, I would require the same protections as those talented people supporting me. Generative Ai is not fair use and abuses copyright protection. Thank you for ensuring the livelihood of artists and writers by upholding existing copyright laws and saying no copyright protections to the companies behind generative Ai and the people who use such tools to unlawfully gain from others.
