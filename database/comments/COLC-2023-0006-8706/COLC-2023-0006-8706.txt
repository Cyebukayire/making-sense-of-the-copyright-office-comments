Generative Ai should never be copyrighted. It can only use EXISTING things. Unlike collage which has thought behind it Ai only has a couple of words. Ai doesn&#39;t understand what is a dog or a cat it only knows what people have shown it to be a dog or a cat. And people behind those prompts don&#39;t give a 2nd thought to their ideas. They will just ask for Supergirl there is no creativity behind that.
