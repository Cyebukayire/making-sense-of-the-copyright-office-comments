Generative AI Comment<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>Since the release of generative AI programs to the public in 2022, American society has found itself facing a grave threat to its identity and its integrity. Generative AIs were trained through the illegal acquisition of protected material, as the companies that developed them used the intellectual property of individuals and companies without compensation or permission, which means that any of their products are similarly illegal under the contemporary understanding of copyright law. Despite the illegal nature of the products of generative AIs, millions of people and thousands of corporations have embraced the technology, which threatens the entire rule of law within the USA, as well as potentially threatening the underpinnings of academic research, the entertainment industry, and the practice of law.<br/><br/>Criminal Origins and Criminal Acts<br/><br/>As mentioned above, generative AI is built on a foundation of illegality, so it should not be a surprise to anyone that the primary utilization of generative AI is criminal in nature. When individuals use text-based generative AI programs, such as ChatGPT, to create &lsquo;new&rsquo; text, the programs are looting the elements of the &lsquo;new&rsquo; text from millions of copyrighted texts. When individuals use image-based generative AI programs, such as Stable Diffusion, to create &lsquo;new&rsquo; images, the programs are looting the elements of the &lsquo;new&rsquo; image from billions of copyrighted images.  Similar illegal activity is occurring with audio and video generative AI programs, which has resulted in the illegal products of generative AI programs finding their way into video games.<br/><br/>While the consequences for copyright violations are troubling, generative AI technology facilitates profoundly disturbing crimes. Criminals use audio-based generative AI programs and text-based generative AI programs to create scripts for confidence games.  They use image generative AI to synthesize nude images of non-consenting individuals and video generative AI to produce videos of illegal pornography. They also use generative AI to defraud consumers through making them believe that the products of generative AI are the products of human artists. Within every passing day, they seem to come up with new schemes that allow them to use generative AI to perpetrate crimes, and more people are getting into crime because of the ease of using generative AI to facilitate crime.<br/><br/>Creative Drowning<br/><br/>Even if we discount the criminal origins and criminal acts that generative AI facilitates, the existence of generative AI is antithetical to the purpose of copyright law, as it hinders, rather than promotes, human creativity. We have seen millions of images and texts produced through generative AI flood the digital markets over the last year as fraudsters attempt to pass them off as human work in order to generate fast cash. Sometimes, they even attempt to pass their work off as a new product of established writers or famous artists, and they can defraud thousands of people before their products are taken down from digital markets.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Before the advent of generative AI, it was hard enough for new artists and writers to gain the attention required for success, but they are now drowning under the weight of an infinite number of generative AI products. Without action from the Copyright Office, we will lose a generation of artists and writers, as they will give up on their craft if they have no hope of gaining the attention of the public, much less earning a living through their craft. Consumers are also impacted because the diversity of human work is replaced by reductive generative AI products that lack human creativity.<br/><br/>Solution<br/><br/>Many people have claimed that generative AI is a technology that governments should not attempt to regulate, but I believe that the threats posed by generative AI require much higher levels of regulation than most technologies. Generative AI functions as the social equivalent of nuclear weapons, the actual negative consequences far exceed any potential positive benefits, and it should be regulated accordingly. The technology is just too easily exploited for harm, and it is up to governments to protect their citizens and their residents from that harm. <br/><br/>The reason why companies produce and use generative AI programs is that they believe that they will enjoy an economic return. If the Copyright Office bans any use of generative AI from copyrighted works, then companies will no longer produce and use generative AI, as they will be unable to enjoy any profits from their work. While criminals may continue to use generative AI, law enforcement will have time to adapt their tactics to deal with consequences of generative AI with the halting of the progression of the technology. Otherwise, I am afraid we could see the unraveling of human society within the decade, as the products of generative AI will shape our perceptions of reality.<br/><br/>
