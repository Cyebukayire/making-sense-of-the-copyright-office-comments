Hello, I am a working professional artist having worked in video games and movies for 10 years. I believe that AI art is stealing upon millions of art work made by humans. It is unethical and should be shut down. The database for the current AI art creation programs must be scrapped and the companies should ask permission for each image to be used to each individual artist. Thank you.
