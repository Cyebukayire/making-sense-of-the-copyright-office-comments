Since I&rsquo;ve gained consciousness one thing I loved the most was to create. I spent years and years creating and growing. I hoped to get a job in the art industry but then ai was introduced. Empty soulless stolen images blended to make something. Made in seconds. Stomping on all those years millions of artists spent improving their skill all to put in a database to steal from their efforts. Ai is in desperate need of regulation before things get out of control. So far it&rsquo;s been used to create false images portraying propaganda to spread lies. Many can&rsquo;t even tell the difference between real and ai. This leads to much confusion, delusion, and misinformation spread.
