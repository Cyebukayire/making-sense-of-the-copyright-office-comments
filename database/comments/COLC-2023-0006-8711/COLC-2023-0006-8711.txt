I am a literary agent with strong familiarity with the technological underpinnings of LLM technology (aka &quot;AI&quot;). This technology has already created a serious burden on the short fiction market, with prestigious magazines being swamped by LLM-generated fiction, which makes it increasingly difficult for these incubators of culture to stay in business. In publishing, the current impact has primarily been on cover designers and audiobook narrators, who are being pushed out of work or seeing their income depressed. Editors are another role at risk-- it is easy for an LLM to &quot;evaluate&quot; a novel for marketability, effectively demoting editors to the role of cleaning up algorithmically-approved manuscripts, which can only weaken our deeply rooted literary culture. We are not far off from LLMs being capable of generating coherent novels, and strong regulations are warranted before we get to that point. <br/><br/>I believe that the ruling that LLM-generated work cannot be copyrighted is appropriate, and puts natural checks on the technology. However, without an effective way of knowing whether a given work is LLM-generated, that ruling is ultimately extremely limited. I believe we need a supporting regulation that makes it easy for regulators and consumers to identify how much of a work is LLM-generated.<br/><br/>Finally, all use of an author&#39;s work for training models must be by consent. &quot;Opt-out&quot; models are not acceptable, particularly when generating works that could be considered &quot;Derivative Works&quot; of the author&#39;s actual creations. There is no other circumstance in which it would be acceptable to produce and sell derivative works of non-public-domain material without consent, so LLM-generated works &quot;in the style of&quot; a known author or artist must be treated accordingly. <br/><br/>I do feel that there are appropriate uses of LLMs in the creative process, but using them to generate a finished product can only have the effect of making it impossible for ordinary Americans to pursue creative careers. While many tech entrepreneurs still subscribe to the &quot;move fast and break things&quot; ideology, it is not in the American interest for entire sectors of the economy to be broken. We need thoughtful regulations that treat LLM-generated works as less protected than human-authored works; that protect the rights of the authors, artists, and other creative people whose works are incorporated into training sets, usually without consent; and that preserve the basic structure of our existing creative industries, such that workers are able to enter them in roles other than &quot;LLM babysitter.&quot;
