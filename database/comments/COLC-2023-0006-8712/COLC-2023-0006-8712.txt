Generative Ai is awful. They scrapped so many artists hard work with no Repercussions. They never asked. They stole intellectual property from millions. And we are pissed. I grew up with Tumblr. When the only art theft was 12 year-olds and you had the art community helping stop them. Now with ai, I and millions of others don&#39;t feel safe sharing our work because it will be stolen and then used for profit. It is NOT okay that it was made with others intellectual information/materials. It will never be okay. They should be in jail. It&#39;s ridiculous that the community had to invent Glaze and Nightshade as protective measures since there are no laws that are strong enough to protect people. This situation has gone on far too long and is hurting millions. We should protect eachother. We should respect eachother. We should have the people who profited loose their stolen profits from the art they stole. Art= writing and paintings/drawings/any creative pursuit that was scraped.
