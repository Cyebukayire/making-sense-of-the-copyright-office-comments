I believe certain criteria must be met for ai generated content to be copyrighted. Written and image work should, as with music and video, be transformative and altered enough from its original state. This is because I believe ai to be in the same category as a random formation you&#39;d find in nature. One cannot copyright a piece of marble or wood until it is carved into a statue or sculpture. This should be true of generated noise, random assets and literary jibberish a computer outputs. An artist must take that work, and transform it, to call it art. In its base state, it is noise.<br/><br/>When it comes to works that are trained on a specific artist or their work, I believe lawsuits should be a reasonable way to settle such issues. That an artist should have the right to take someone to court over making money off of their art style or remixing their art into something new using ai. This should be something artists have the right to take legal action against.<br/><br/>I also believe that we should look to music as an example of what constitutes transformative work, legal use of small snippets of art such that they no longer resemble the work of another artist, and what should be the standard for how much resemblance to an existing work or style is allowed before it can be considered a forgery or theft of work. The music industry has dealt with remixes, bootleg remixes, and music sample rights for decades. This is not new to the art world, merely new to the photography and digital painting scene. What counts as a forgery in traditional painting and sketch work should also be taken into account when setting the precedent for laws regarding ai art  and what lawful use looks like.<br/><br/>Something that should also be considered is ai that is trained on work you legally own, such as stock you purchase, work you have drawn yourself, photographs of yourself or taken by yourself, and the like. As not all ai content is based around other person&#39;s content; ai generations trained on content you do own as an individual should be considered, if for no other reason than as in comparison to ai generations trained on content one does not own.<br/><br/>Lastly, consider the effects such legislation would have on matte painting, music remixes, news copy, and the practice of making physical art out of fragments or pieces of other works or products. Some examples: a painting out of newspaper clippings, a video game industry concept made of photo bashing different photo snippets together, music made using entirely samples of preexisting works or audios, and sculptures made of coke cans. These works may be vital to understanding where and how ai generations fit into the art world. It should be understood that there are many types of ai, some that generate without artistic input, and some that generate wholly based on the input of the individual controlling it. Example: stable diffusion automatic1111 and Adobe&#39;s new generative ai tool. In these cases, the generation is conducted, guided, or orchestrated by the person using the tool, and is not random. As opposed to a random number generator or a simpler ai generator which is less controlled and has less creative input. Even that is a slippery slope however, as some modern artists make millions selling spilled paint bucket splatters that for all intents and purposes, are more random than painting via brush.<br/><br/>In the discussion of ai, there is much to consider and I do hope I have brought to your attention some scenarios and legal complexities that may arise in more detail than &quot;ai bad&quot; or &quot;ai good&quot; and I sincerely wish you the best in exploring the nuance of creative work and ownership. Thank you.
