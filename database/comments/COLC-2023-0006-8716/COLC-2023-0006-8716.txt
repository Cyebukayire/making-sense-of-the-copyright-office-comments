Debates over copyright eligibility and misappropriated data are missing the bigger issue. It is a question of speed. Without regulation the output of image(and other media) generators will quickly send the value of all creative industries to zero. Copyright will be impossible to enforce because nothing needs to be published. Anyone can skirt IP protections by generating custom movies/music/games at home. No sale needs to take place, except the subscription to the AI service itself. <br/><br/>Forcing companies to regulate the speed of individual generations to near human speeds, would go some way to balancing the playing field. A large tax on AI subscriptions would force studios to reconsider replacing all human workers with AI. The end of creative industries may be inevitable, but we are facing an unprecedented level of job displacement. We are simply not prepared as a society and the companies building these models have taken no responsibility for these repercussions. Regulation needs to happen at the government level and that takes time. Simply slow them down. Give people a chance to adapt.<br/><br/>Misinformation and identity theft are arguably more immediate threats, but I will defer to others to debate those issues.
