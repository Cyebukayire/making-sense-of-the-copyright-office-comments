As an artist who has worked extensively with both traditional and AI tools, I am concerned that incidental arguments will cloud the main issue: creators of art (however that is ultimately defined) must be able to claim ownership of their creations and any rights to use/exploit them.<br/>Current public AGI models are 1) built off the unauthorized use of owned creations by persons/institutions that do not own them and have not legally acquired rights to them. Clear ownership and exercise of private property (including Intellectual Property) is an essential function of modern civilization and modern economies. If these AGI programs are operated for profit, and they are, there is no practical or moral reason they cannot acquire IP in the same way they acquire servers or engineers.<br/>2) current AGI allow and in some cases encourage users to imitate specific artists and their works; and specifically to use elements of those works in a deliberately derivative and recognizable way that impinges on the reserved IP rights of those artists. Platforms use this as a selling point, not simply allowing but promoting (and profiting from) the unlicensed use of privately-owned property.<br/>AGI offers fascinating opportunities for creativity and commerce, but copy rights are not a convenience for some. They are fundamental rights for all citizens and form the bedrock of a free, vibrant, and stable society.<br/><br/>Thank you!
