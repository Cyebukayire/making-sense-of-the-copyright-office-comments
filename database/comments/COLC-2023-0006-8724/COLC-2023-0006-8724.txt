Hello, I am a 2D Animator, and I I strongly urge congress to pass a law calling for the regulation of any AI generated tools, specifically in a way where people who have their work stolen by AI algorithm can profit of it if they choose. The overwhelming exploitation of AI from tech companies has already had disastrous results for many artists, animators, writers, translators... the list could go on and on but it will only get worse if left unchecked. The exploitation by companies has already made it more difficult for anyone in creative fields such as artists, animators, and writers to find new work. And it will only get worse.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m gonna be honest I&rsquo;m only submitting this because I really think I need to do something but at the same time I really hate having to write essays or write anything in essay format. There&rsquo;s also thousands of other people writing comments on this anyways so if it&rsquo;s hard for you to follow well hopefully one of the other thousands of people explained it better than I did.<br/><br/>Adobe is already attempting to fully integrating AI into their programs, and has been advertising it a lot over the last few days (as of writing):<br/><br/>https://twitter.com/Adobe/status/1712279941021393128 a program to automatically dub things into different languages<br/><br/>https://twitter.com/Adobe/status/1712270534984220977 AI redrawing art<br/><br/>This will not only cause a catastrophic loss in the already struggling job market for artists and creators, but it will eventually affect the job markets of <br/><br/>The lack of regulation on AI will also cause a catastrophic rise of disinformation, more than it already likely has. From this article: https://www.axios.com/2023/10/12/mcmahon-misinformation-cbs-deep-fakes-bfd <br/><br/>&ldquo;CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon says the network has sifted through more than 1,000 videos of the Israel-Hamas war &mdash; and only 10% are usable.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;&quot;There are many reasons why, but some of those reasons are directly tied to misinformation. They absolutely are,&quot; McMahon told Axios&#39; Sara Fischer at the Axios BFD in New York on Thursday. &ldquo;<br/><br/>&quot;The reality is that there will be an influx of deepfakes and misinformation flowing into our newsrooms at a scale, at a speed, at a level of sophistication that will be staggering. &ldquo;<br/><br/>AI generation has even been part of why google, a tool that once allowed for someone to easily search for a near infinite fountain of information right in the palm of their hand, to become nearly unusable. For example, let&rsquo;s say I want to search for &ldquo;country in africa that starts with k&rdquo;. This is the FIRST result: https://www.emergentmind.com/posts/did-you-know-that-there-is-no-country-in-africa-that<br/><br/>a site that touts itself as &ldquo;AI-Powered News&rdquo;, quoting a chatGPT generated message that&rsquo;s spouting bizarre gaslighting misinformation. The answer should be simple, right up at the top of the search engine, &ldquo;Kenya&rdquo;, but instead the answer shown is &ldquo;While there are 54 recognized countries in Africa, none of them begin with the letter &quot;K&quot;. The closest is Kenya, which starts with a &quot;K&quot; sound, but is actually spelled with a &quot;K&quot; sound. It&#39;s always interesting to learn new trivia facts like this.&rdquo;<br/><br/>this video does a good job of summarizing the issue with google right now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48AOOynnmqU
