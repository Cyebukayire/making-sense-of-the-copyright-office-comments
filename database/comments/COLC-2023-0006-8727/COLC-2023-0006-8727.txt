Generative AI and Copyright<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>In the last year or so, we have seen the invention and distribution of several publicly-available generative AI programs, such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Stability.ai. Since then, we have seen millions of images and texts generated by AI with little human invention involved in the process. The datasets used to create these programs not only used copyrighted artworks and texts, but also social media photographs of children, and private medical records, amongst other sensitive material. Despite the questionable nature of the datasets these programs were trained on, and despite the fact that generative AI, despite its name, does not possess the consciousness to have a moral compass and discern right from wrong, the technology has been largely embraced as a novelty, and a boon to the entertainment industry. However, this technology poses an undeniable threat to independent creators, as well as people&rsquo;s privacy and ability to consent to the use of their own image. <br/><br/>Impacts on Creativity<br/><br/>When generative AI is used to create a work, no new ideas are being created. Based on how generative AI datasets are created by being trained off the work of others, it is impossible for generative AI to produce works that are not. One of the reasons we value copyright and intellectual property is to incentivize inventiveness and new approaches to making and creating. With generative AI, society does not receive the benefits from the creation of new ideas, and the expression of new perspectives. Generative AI cannot create its own ideas, it can only copy other ideas.<br/><br/>Impacts on Human Creators<br/><br/>Around this time last year, The Atlantic published an article that used an image created in Midjourney as the editorial illustration. Due to the parasitic nature of generative AI, it is entirely possible that the illustrator whose style was copied by the AI could have been hired and paid to create a similar illustration instead. The products of generative AI disadvantage human creators by taking work from artists and writers who rely on commissions to make a living. To add insult to injury, because the artworks used in the datasets for AI were taken without permission, it is entirely possible that the very artist who would otherwise have been hired for a job had their own images or text used to train the AI that took that job away from them, all without their knowledge or consent. <br/><br/>Due to the increased use of generative AI in the place of jobs that used to be given to human beings, AI poses a threat to the working artists, writers, and other creatives who would otherwise be able to make a living off of their work, all in service of an inferior, derivative product. This will have negative impacts on the creativity by reducing the outlets for human creators to make a living, which will further discourage the invention of new ideas and perspectives, as outlined above, and will quiet the voices of lesser-known creators who are still trying to gain a foothold in creative industries. <br/><br/>AI is Devoid of Context<br/><br/>There are human-created artistic forms that often exist on the fringe of copyright, such as music sampling, satire and collage, in which other creative works may be appropriated without permission from the original creator. However, these artforms still exist within the context of the source material, to honor, critique or transform that material. AI, however, is devoid of context. It hides the sources it references in its generation of text or images, and fails to make a connection with the original source material in any meaningful way. Therefore, generative AI cannot be compared to human-created artforms that appropriate existing copyrighted works.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>While the Copyright Office holds little power over some of the damaging impacts of generative AI, such as the facilitation of scams and fraud, it does have the power to protect independent creators who are trying to make a living sharing their work with the world. Granting copyright to AI-generated artworks goes against the very nature of why we have copyright, which is to encourage and facilitate human creation and innovation, and to ensure that the humans who labor over their creative works have protections over their creation&mdash;the very protections generative AI has violated through its production of derivative texts and images from data obtained without the creator&rsquo;s consent. I urge the Copyright Office not to grant copyright to generative AI works in order to ensure that human creativity and labor is able to continue to flourish.<br/>
