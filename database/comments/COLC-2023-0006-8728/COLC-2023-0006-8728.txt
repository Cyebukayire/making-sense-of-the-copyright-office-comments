Good day<br/>My name is Juan Calle, an illustrator based in Bogota, colombia for over 20 years now, and I would like to give notice to the problematic nature of generative AI images in particular. Some pieces of mine have been included on the LAION B dataset , used for training of the vast majority of widespread used Image generators now available.and given that my work represents a minuscule fraction of the work used to train them, the fact is these are now are FOR PROFIT models, and that in itself is a problem.   <br/>Despite the &quot;generative&quot; nature of these foundation models, And that the results created could be compared to collage litigations on copyright matters, the truth is that the current use of models like stable difusion is just to create an avalanche of images that just:<br/>1. Devalue the work of the artist<br/>2. puts the artist in direct financial competition with derivative gerated work, since the artist style can now be recreated (this could be the biggest hurdle for copyright if AI images are granted copyrightable status)<br/>3. Doesn&#39;t compensate the artist whose work has been included in the models. There hasn&#39;t been a grant of rights of use (no opt in method) by any artist to license their work for these for profit companies. <br/>I urge for the copyright office to at least maintain the status of prompt generated images as NON COPYRIGHTABLE. Even Images with image2image and controlnet human input should be non copyrightable as they are really not created by humans, but requested by humans, albeit with thought requirements. <br/>The current abuse on IP infringement by people using AI to create images of copyrighted characters, rip off artists by modifying their work and sell them as their own, and straight up create Lora models to steal artists style likeness has been increasing alarmingly in months. From artists all over the world, not just the US. <br/>The system of fair use has been exploited and abused in the case of datasets used by image generators, it would only be fair to maintain the status of any an all Images that used generative AI as NON COPYRIGHTABLE and on public domain. <br/>The economic damage for many is already being felt by the artist community.<br/>The problem also come for the copyright related litigation, where cases will increase in which AI images are used to ripoff artists and the cost of the legalities will be prohibitive to any real artist to take cases to court, specially against the corporations pushing this tech after ripping off images without compensation to train their models. When you need an image for your product, you ask permission first and pay for it, and that never happened. <br/>Regulation against these foundation models is needed, probably not from the Copyright office, but from other regulatory branches of the government to prevent a collapse of the market for the artists and the implications of that happening bleeding into the economy of many countries, despite the fact the damage was done by US companies. <br/>Thanks for your attention, don&#39;t give AI images Copyright status, please
