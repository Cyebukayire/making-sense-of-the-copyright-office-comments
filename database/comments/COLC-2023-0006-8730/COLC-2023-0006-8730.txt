It&#39;s been an incredibly frustrating year to see so many of these tech giants basically lobbying and paying millions to capital hill without the input of artists who they literally stole and trained their entire dataset off of. As artists, we already don&#39;t make that much money to begin with and it literally feels like a David and Goliath story. We have started using Glaze and will be using Nightshade to protect ourselves from being trained. I really hope the U.S. can stand by the working class and not diminish our literal hard work.
