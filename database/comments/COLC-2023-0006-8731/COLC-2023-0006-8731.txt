I used to sell art commissions of people&#39;s fictional characters. It was my dream. I loved doing it. It was only a side hustle, but I dreamed of doing it full-time. I was bringing these people&#39;s ideas to life, expressing myself, creating. I wanted to be able to keep doing it, so when I had kids, I could stay at home with them and work on art while watching them. That&#39;s something AI can not know the joy of. Since the AI craze hit the internet, I have not sold a single commission. It hurts. I work at a print shop now. AI killed my dream.
