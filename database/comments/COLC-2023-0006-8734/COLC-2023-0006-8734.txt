Artwork of any sort that is completely generated by a machine learning algorithm should not be eligible for copyright due to how the majority of such algorithms&#39; data is acquired.<br/><br/>A.I. image algorithms, especially the widespread ones such as Stable Diffusion, are required to be fed existing art as learning data in order to work, making its output a combination of those images. The way the learning data is acquired by these programs is through blatant theft of existing copyrighted artworks online, and should therefore be considered a breach of copyright law.<br/><br/>Furthermore, an A.I.&#39;s ability to combine multiple images into a desired output is different from a human artist&#39;s ability to recognize and apply artistic theory using a reference image, as it requires skill, imagination, and originality. The person who simply types a prompt into a machine is not using any of this to achieve a work of art, and the work should therefore not be considered original or eligible for copyright.
