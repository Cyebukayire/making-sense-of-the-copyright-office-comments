I&#39;m a freelance commercial illustrator. I create illustrations and other related work for publishing, advertising, animation, and video game industries. I am not an expert in copyright law or AI/ML, but do need to deal with copyright in my day-to-day business practice. My answers below reflect my work and industry. Answers are numbered according to the &ldquo;General Questions&rdquo; list provided by the Office. <br/><br/>1-2. My view is that generative Machine Learning/AI systems, particularly in the realm of illustration and digital media in general, present risks that far outweigh the purported benefits. ML/AI systems threaten the livelihoods of many kinds of workers in all creative industries by exploiting the labor and creations of these same workers. As ML/AI systems continue to be used in unregulated and careless ways, it is my view that ML/AI-generated artwork, photography, and writing will contribute to the spread of misinformation across society in ways that we are not prepared for. AI/ML systems, in the realm of artwork, do not, in my view, participate in the world of creative expression that human artists and workers do. I&rsquo;m not concerned about AI/ML technology that helps scientists parse enormous amounts of data to further the progression of scientific discoveries. Generative AI/ML systems in the artwork/photography scene exist to make a handful of venture capitalist-fueled companies a bit of money, without any consideration for the affect they may have on copyright, creative industries, and society as a whole. <br/><br/>5. Yes. Regulation to prohibit ML/AI systems from training on materials without consent from the original creator. Regulation to require that ML/AI generated work be flagged as ML/AI generated upon generation and upon publication. Regulation to require disclosure of what the original source material might be, whether that means pointing to a data set or some other source. <br/><br/>6. Copyright-protected illustrations are freely scraped from the internet without consent from artists. This can be commercial illustration or personal artwork. <br/><br/>7.4. This is the perspective of someone who isn&rsquo;t an expert in AI/ML, but is trained in visual literacy and to analyze visual styles. It is very obvious at first glance when an image is generated to purposefully replicate the style of a specific artist&rsquo;s work, and one can infer from there that the AI model was trained on that artist&rsquo;s portfolio of work. <br/><br/>9. Copyright owners should have to affirmatively consent/opt into the use of their work for training materials. Companies that participate in the &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; model have no interest in protecting the copyright interests of artists. How can one single artist keep track of the many times their artwork would be used in training models? Why should it be an individual&rsquo;s responsibility to keep track of a corporation&rsquo;s lightning-speed, automated, nigh endless copyright infringements? <br/>If there&rsquo;s only an &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; model, this is like giving corporations permission to use a &ldquo;do first, ask forgiveness later&rdquo; approach on a scale that is impossible for an individual artist to fully counter. I&rsquo;m not even certain that an AI/ML system can &ldquo;unlearn&rdquo; the data its already used in training if an artist opts out. <br/><br/>15. Yes and yes. <br/>15.1 Names of creators and source the image was derived from. I imagine this can get even more complicated if AI/ML uses AI/ML generated images to train on. <br/>15.2 Disclosure should be made to the creators of the source image, and should accompany publication of any AI/ML media. <br/>15.3 Developers should do their due diligence to make sure that the data they use has been responsibly collected, and check if the third parties disclose their own data sets. <br/>32. Yes, but I imagine this would be difficult to enforce. I can only think that you would need to prohibit an AI/ML system from using artists&rsquo; work to train on  without their consent.
