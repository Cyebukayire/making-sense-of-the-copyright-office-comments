Generative AI has proven to be an incredibly powerful tool. I would argue it&#39;s actually a great tool that should be continued to be allowed to be used. However, in most cases, it is not being used ethically. Many data sets that are used to train the models used in these AI are using massive amounts of copyrighted images.<br/><br/>After much research and discussion, I have come to my own conclusion on the matter:<br/><br/>The value of the AI is derived from the AI model, and the AI model&#39;s value is often derived from the plethora of high quality copyrighted works that it is trained it. Therefore, the AI models only have value based on the datasets they use. So in my opinion, based on no other factors, it currently violates fair use if an AI model was trained on copyrighted works, especially if that AI model is not free, or is used for profit in subscription services such as Midjourney. <br/><br/>For other factors, whether it stores the images in the model (often proven by underfitting) or anything else, I am not really concerned about. I believe that the AI models trained on copyrighted works are stealing value from those works and also compete in the same market as those works, and should not be legal.<br/><br/>Many artists have begun to use Glaze or Nightshade. These are software algorithms that can inject visually imperceptible data to the images that can destroy datasets. Basically: The algorithm changes pixels on the canvas in a certain way, which in turn, if the image is used to train a dataset, it can cause the AI model to become corrupted. This is one of many ways that artists and other creatives are trying to protect their works from being used unethically and illegaly (against fair use/copyright), since they don&#39;t have any other avenues available.<br/><br/>Like I said: I believe AI is an incredibly useful tool and it should be here to stay. However, it should not get there by profiting off the backs of existing, copyrighted works. The Quantity AND Quality of the works are what are used to make a good model, so they shouldn&#39;t even be paid pennies in royalties per-work, they should be compensated more. The datasets need to be ethically sourced, and if there are any copyrighted works used, they need to be compensated appropriately. <br/><br/>
