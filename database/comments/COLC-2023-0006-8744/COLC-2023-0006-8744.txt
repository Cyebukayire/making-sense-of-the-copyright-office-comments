Submitted by Online Submission Procedure<br/><br/>Hon. Shira Perlmutter<br/>Register of Copyrights and Director<br/>U.S. Copyright Office<br/>101 Independence Ave., S.E.<br/>Washington, DC 20559<br/><br/>RE: Notice of Inquiry and Request for Comments: Artificial Intelligence and Copyright (Docket No. 2023-18624)<br/><br/>Dear Register Perlmutter:<br/><br/>We are writing to express the views of the American Bar Association&rsquo;s (the &ldquo;Association&rdquo;) Section of Intellectual Property Law (the &ldquo;Section&rdquo;) responding to the U.S. Copyright Office (&ldquo;Office&rdquo;) August 30, 2023 Notice of Inquiry and Request for Comment (&ldquo;NOI&rdquo;) on artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) and copyright issues. The views expressed herein have not been reviewed or approved by the House of Delegates or the Board of Governors of the American Bar Association and, accordingly, should not be construed as representing the policy of the American Bar Association. These comments do not represent the policy or views of any government employee who is a member of the Section, its Council, or its Interest Groups.<br/><br/>Prior to the NOI, the Section participated in two prior requests for comments concerning AI that are relevant to the Office&rsquo;s inquiry: (1) the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office&rsquo;s requests for comments on Intellectual Property Protection for Artificial Intelligence Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. 44889 (August 27, 2019) and 84 Fed. Reg. 58141 (October 30, 2019) (respectively, &ldquo;USPTO AI Patent Comments&rdquo; and &ldquo;USPTO AI IP Comments&rdquo;); and (2) the World Intellectual Property Organization&rsquo;s request for comments on its Draft Issues Paper on Intellectual Property Policy and Artificial Intelligence, WIPO/IP/AI/2/GE/20/1 (December 13, 2019) (&ldquo;WIPO Comments&rdquo;). Those prior comments are enclosed herewith for your review.<br/><br/>Before responding to the Office&rsquo;s specific questions, we share the Section&rsquo;s views on three critical issues. First, the Section opposes, in principle, recognizing an artificial intelligence as an &ldquo;author&rdquo; under US copyright law. An AI process or machine (e.g., AI agent) does not, on its own, satisfy the<br/>requirements to be an author set forth in the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s opinions concerning what it means to be an author. Instead, an implicit component of the Court&rsquo;s decisions is that human creation is necessary for authorship. The core question, then, is when a human being uses a machine or device (e.g., a camera used to make a photograph, or an AI used to make an image) in developing the human&rsquo;s conception, what is the nature or degree of human participation required to treat the creation as the product of human authorship.1 Our view is that the same reasoning that has been applied to other machines used to create works of authorship should be applied where a human being uses an AI agent or other instrumentality &ndash; e.g., through programming or input &ndash; to develop their conception and fix it in a tangible medium of expression. Second, the Section opposes, in principle, recognizing an artificial intelligence as an assignee, licensee, or other type of party having an ownership or possessory interest to a copyright recognized under Title 17. Third, the Section opposes, in principle, a new sui generis law to supplement US copyright, patent, trade secrets, data access (e.g., Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC &sect; 1030) or contract law to protect artificial intelligence data sets and databases.<br/><br/>We appreciate the Office&rsquo;s inquiry on these matters and support the overall goal of exploring complex questions and issues, including those highlighted by the Office such as the use of copyrighted works to train AI models, the appropriate levels of transparency and disclosure with respect to the use of copyrighted works, and the legal status of AI-generated outputs. We also appreciate the Office&rsquo;s inclusion of a glossary of key terms to ensure consistent terminology and reference to AI technologies are used by all stakeholders. Capitalized terms in this response have the meaning set out in the NOI&rsquo;s glossary unless otherwise noted. We have answered below ten (plus one subpart) of the questions that are presented in the NOI. Additionally, we recognize the need and potential benefit of having more time to consider and debate input collected from its members at a deeper level given the variations in, and still-developing circumstances surrounding, how AI systems are developed, used, and protected.<br/><br/>&lt;&lt; See attached letter for additional text &gt;&gt;<br/><br/>As noted in response to Questions 18, 19, and 20 above, the Copyright Clause should allow for protection assuming sufficient human intervention and involvement is demonstrated.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Should you have additional questions, we would welcome further discussion with the Office.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Steven P. Caltrider, Chair<br/>ABA Section of Intellectual Property Law<br/><br/>See attached file(s)
