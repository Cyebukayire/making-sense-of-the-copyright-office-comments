To Whom it May Concern,<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Artificial Intelligence Study. I am a professional author and illustrator with thirteen years of experience in internet-based publishing of fiction novels and graphic novels, along with fifteen years of experience in freelance collectible product illustration working with licensed properties such as Disney, Warner Brothers, NFL, and more. My independent work is published online for paying readers, and many of my freelance clients discovered me online.<br/><br/>I would like to raise concerns regarding the Artificial Intelligence Study:<br/><br/>As an artist whose independent work is crowdfunded via the internet, my livelihood depends on the ability to share online samples of my copyrighted writing and art materials, and sometimes the full contents of the materials, all rights reserved. It has always been understood that sharing one&rsquo;s work does not give others the right to use it without permission. AI models consume and retain the full data of all work included in their datasets, and these datasets are then distributed to others without the permission of those whose work was taken. Moreover, these models often replicate portions of existing art, including signatures, watermarks, trademarks, and other unique content. As a creator who works with many niche subjects, the smaller sample size of competitive works means replications of my work are likely to be prominent in AI-generated materials on the subject.<br/><br/>Secondly, I want to raise privacy concerns surrounding the wholesale scraping of user data online. A significant portion of professionals no longer have the option to conduct business solely in person, and the internet must be a place where we can conduct business and share proprietary information across cloud services without fear of those confidential materials being integrated into AI models before our client has a chance to approve and use it. In addition to maintaining my own personal artwork, I often access style guides, legal guides, and other sensitive, proprietary information from my corporate clients via the internet and cloud services. If I create a product design using the Disney license, I want Disney to be able to approve it for manufacture without an AI model analyzing and replicating portions of it for a stranger first. Likewise, I share manuscripts with my agent before they are submitted to publishers, and if a cloud service has the ability to analyze and replicate my manuscript before submission, that&rsquo;s a loss to both me and the acquiring publisher who expects that the work they buy will be unique. These confidential materials must be protected from incorporation into artificial intelligence models.<br/><br/>And finally, it is my proposal that AI models must only incorporate items used with permission, and that any model created through indiscriminate collection of copyrighted materials must be discontinued and rebuilt using only materials obtained with permission. This permission must also be granted through honest, non-coercive means. For example, few people in the United States can earn a living, communicate with employers, or even shop for necessities without a Google account. Therefore, it&rsquo;s coercive for a company like Google to require incorporation of our private materials into AI models in exchange for using the service. Permission to use our personal data and copyrighted materials must be truly and fully optional.<br/><br/>In summary, I recommend legislation to protect user data and copyrighted materials from being collected and analyzed by AI models unless permission has been granted by the creator through fair and non-coercive means.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Shobana Appavu
