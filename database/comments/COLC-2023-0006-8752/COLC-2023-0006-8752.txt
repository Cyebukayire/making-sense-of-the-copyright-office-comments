AI or artificial intelligence MUST be regulated. Right now. As it stands, it is the Wild West. And most of the harm goes to the people who actually produce and help art grow. AI technology as it is &ldquo;scrapes&rdquo; the internet for images and uses them without the consent, knowledge, or consideration of the people who made the images. Imagine if you had planted a field, grew it, and got it all ready for harvest and Out of NOWHERE someone who you don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;ve never met and someone who has never grown anything in their life decides that the field YOU GREW was THEIRS. THIS PERSON takes your entire field and says that they made it. They harvest it, they sell it for dozens of times what it&rsquo;s worth. They ruin your field. They obliterate your ability to make more. And then they tell you to make more. That is what AI art is. It is not intelligence. It is an unethical practice modernized by machine learning to be more efficient at theft. With dishonest practices and unlawful execution of obtaining data, AI is just theft. There is no other way of putting it. And the denial of all these things, would be contradictory to the Standards of the Law.
