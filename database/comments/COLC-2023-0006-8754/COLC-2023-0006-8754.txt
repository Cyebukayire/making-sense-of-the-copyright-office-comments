I am a video game designer. Video games are among the only places I believe generative AI can be used ethically, however that ethicality does not involve replacing a human&#39;s job at any point.<br/>To speak directly to copywrite issues, it is important to understand that an computer cannot learn with out theft. Generative AI tools, especially art-specific ones, are &#39;trained&#39; off of other people&#39;s art, but they can only rob elements of an image from artists, they cannot take a human&#39;s art and grow from it. AI will only ever be as good as the artist it has stolen from.<br/>AI can also be used to imitate voice actors, which uses their voices to create things they have never said. This is entirely unethical, as, right now, a company could theoretically use a voice actor&#39;s voice in their project, and never have to pay the voice actor anything, because the voice is actually AI generated.<br/>There are many artistic and voice acting roles in my industry, game development. Already we have seen AI being used to replace human artists/voice actors in what amounts to an attempt by a company to save money. They are not concerned with ethical issues surrounding AI. They are not concerned with the lower quality product they are putting out into the world, nor are they concerned with the livelihoods of the people they might have hired instead.<br/>AI has no place without strict regulation, and has no place being given a job that a human could have, and should have, done. Theft is inherent to generative artistic/voice acting AI, and artists have full right to protect themselves and their works/voices from those who would seek to benefit from their talent, hard work, and effort.
