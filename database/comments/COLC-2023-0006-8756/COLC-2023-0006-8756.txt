AI users steal easier than ever, and it squelches the creativity and hard work of everyone else. I now have to look two or three times at an image to tell if it&#39;s real or truthful. Please don&#39;t let companies steal people&#39;s hard work, unless they enjoy having their &#39;hard work&#39; stolen by others. Please help companies do an initial opt-in system rather than initial opt-out. We (creatives) want to be able to give our consent first, not fight tooth and nail for our right to be protected after our work has been stolen. AI should be a tool. With tools, come regulations on how and where to use a tool. If consent can&#39;t be given, no one should be allowed to use it anyway. We shouldn&#39;t have to have programs like Glaze or Nightshade to have to protect our work, voice, writing, music, etc. on the internet. Even the images of people - especially young girls - are turned into inappropriate images; pornography that they did not consent to or participate in agreeing to. AI images have also been used to create propaganda and deepfakes.<br/><br/>AI generated images don&#39;t need or deserve copyright protection, since it is based off copyright infringement. It&#39;s plagiarism. It&#39;s theft. These generators and their &#39;content&#39; should be regulated and have rules, terms, and conditions. They should have an opt-in option first and foremost.
