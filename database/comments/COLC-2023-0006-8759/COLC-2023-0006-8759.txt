While there is certainly interesting potential for AI, there is no basis for it to be copyrightable in any sense.  Unlike art, a generative AI model uses algorithms to directly take bits and pieces of other art, often from those who did not consent to have their owned work used in such a way, and assemble those pieces into an image.  The lack of a human element, the direct lifting of other works to train the model, and the easy and exact replicability of would more lean toward copyrighting the solution to a math problem than artwork.
