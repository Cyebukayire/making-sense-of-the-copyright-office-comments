I&#39;m speaking on values and ethics here. For thoughts on the adverse effects generative AI will have on artists, I highly recommend this paper published in August of this year:<br/>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681<br/><br/>When the output of an AI model has been created using copyrighted work and without the consent of the copyright holder, and if said output has not been significantly transformed in some way by human beings, then I do not believe that the output of AI media generators should ever be given copyright. There should also be tools, both legal and technical, to protect artists who have had their work taken to train AI models without their consent.<br/><br/>Quick summary: AI companies have used the work of thousands of artists to train their models without the consent, credit, or compensation of those artists. To be clear, these models would not function or be worth anyone&#39;s time or money if it wasn&#39;t for the ill-gotten data they were trained upon. On top of this, these same models have been loosed upon the public and are now &quot;competing&quot; with those very same artists who have been stolen from. Consequently, these AI companies stand to gain vast wealth from this technology, all while causing massive disruption of entire industries and markets, leading to dwindling job opportunities for working-class artists and to further economic disparity.<br/><br/>I simply do not think you can be an ethical human being and not recognize how demented this progression of events truly is.<br/><br/>What sort of values are we reflecting to our own fellow citizens and to the rest of the world if we are willing to let corporations trample on the economic opportunities of thousands of hard-working people in this manner?<br/><br/>Aside from this ethical dilemma, we must bear in mind that AI does nothing more than regurgitate what it is trained upon; it is an unconscious, unthinking algorithm that does not innovate and would not produce anything of its own will if left unprompted by a human user. Human beings, on the other hand, produce novelty, because they respond and react to their experiences. This is why new art movements are created, like Cubism and Impressionism in the visual arts, or Jazz and Rock n Roll in music. Generative AI can absolutely play a role in this process of creating new cultural artifacts, but in its current form it will discourage new artists from being made. If entire generations of people grow up with machines generating everything for them, where is the artistic and economic incentive for someone to pick up a guitar, or a paint brush, or a camera? We need to encourage and incentivize people to learn and grow and create through the arts, and this starts with robust copyright protections for human creators.<br/><br/>All artists are looking for is a fair competitive playing field, where skill and hard work is rewarded. I implore you to please take the side of the arts by giving copyright protection to AI outputs made only from licensed work and that have also been significantly transformed by a human being. By doing so, new artists can be encouraged to grow and thrive in a healthy creative economy, while AI technology can continue to evolve and be of positive benefit to society.
