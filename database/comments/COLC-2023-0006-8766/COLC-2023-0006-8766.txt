I believe we need clearer guidelines if you are going to limit the ability to create restrictions on what can be copywritten. My attached example took hours of iteration, combining previously generated image&#39;s modifications of the prompt engineered to produce the image in this example. This was created with Midjourney for a story I am crafting with friends in a cooperative storytelling medium. I would like to be able to use this type of art in a published TTRPG campaign, but as it stands that would be difficult. Since then I have been creating art using Stable Diffusion and Comfy UI which takes more specialization, customization, and input from the user to create what I want. I am unclear where the line is for what can and cannot receive a copywrite. How much work and what kind qualify? No one else was going to stumble upon the creation which was called forth from my imagination and effort. See attached file.
