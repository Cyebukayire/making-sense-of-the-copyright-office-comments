Hello,<br/>I am a recent graduate of a 4-year university, and I obtained a Bachelor&#39;s of Science in Computer Science. During my tenure at my university, I completed numerous courses relating to data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In my free time, I am also a hobbyist artist. Because of my background, I believe I am more qualified to speak out about issues surrounding generative artificial intelligence than the average American, and I can offer a unique perspective.<br/><br/>Many of my friends, who are also hobbyist or freelance artists, are concerned about their works being used to train datasets for generative artificial intelligence without their knowledge or consent. Their concern comes from the fact that a generative AI can product a piece of work that looks visually similar to their own. As AI improves over time, the output looks less and less distinguishable from a human produced work, and this will reduce income and commissions.<br/><br/>Although I believe that all works created by an artificial intelligence should remain fair use and public domain, and remain uncopyrightable without significant human input, I do not believe that the current qualifications for Fair Use are sufficiant enough to protect authors and copyright holders from abuse. Authors and copyright holders should be able to submit copyright claims, both against the uploader and the company that created the artificial intelligence, for artificially generated works featuring or closely resembling their own works if it is used for commercial or non-personal use. Additionally, authors and copyright holders should be given a way to revoke their consent from their works being scraped, collected, and used by training algorithms for these artificial intelligences. It is imperative that tools are given to humans to fight against perceived exploitation of their works. As long as the artificial intelligence adheres to these standards, any works created by it can be classified as Fair Use, but this should be disputable on a case-by-case basis. <br/><br/>The most pressing ethical concern surrounding artificial intelligence is that of replicating human likeness. Major film studios such as Disney Warner Bros. are now replicating the likeness of deceased film actors, as seen in recent television and film releases such as Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022) and The Flash (2023). Although these studios obtained the consent of the actors or their estates, it is imperative to ensure that this consensual boundary is not breached. Additional safeguards must be implemented. One such condition should be that actors are not required to give their consent to their likeness being replicated with artificial intelligence to continue work with the studio. Additionally, the actor or their estate must be allowed to revoke consent at any time, or be able to reject their likeness being used in particular works and projects that they don&#39;t approve of.<br/><br/>Also surrounding replicating human likeness is the topic of deepfakes. For example, the technology now exists for bad actors to replicate the voice of any person with a simple 5 minute recording of their voice. This can be weaponized against one&#39;s loved ones in phishing scams or to submit fraudulent evidence of a crime. It is for this reason that I believe using a private individual&#39;s likeness without their explicit consent should be illegal, and the violating party should be forced to pay for damages. For public figures, such as celebrities or politicians, there should be a clear indication that artificial intelligence was used to generate a work. Such works should also fall under existing Fair Use laws, otherwise they can be subject to violating consensual boundaries surrounding using one&#39;s likeness. <br/><br/>Please heed my concerns, both as an artist and as someone who has more background knowledge into this technology than the typical individual.
