AI is trained on data gathered without permission. That is the issue I have with AI . For the sake of future generations of anyone in any field, even any company in any field, it is absolutely essential that there are proper regulations on AI. No model of any kind should ever be allowed to train on the data of individuals or companies without their express and written consent. Otherwise even AI as a tool will never become a way to &lsquo;benefit humanity&rsquo; it will forever be a race to see who can steal the most efficiently. <br/><br/>When it comes to art or writing specifically. Every individual brings themselves to a piece. Even if an entry level artist is told to replicate their senior as close as possible, they physically can not as a human. They will make slight errors, or cater certain shapes to their own preferences. Every moment spent learning has a lens on it, that entry person will have learned differently with miniscule shifts in focus that makes their work their own. For their entire lifetime they will have learned in a completely unique way that no one will ever replicate perfectly. AI does not do this, given a data pool (the issue here is that modern data is stolen) it will replicate every aspect. Every element every decision that a human would put themselves into, is copied without influence from a self. I would not argue that last bit to be innately bad either, if the artist themselves was using it as a tool that&rsquo;d be totally okay. If a company paid an artist and there were royalties for their style too I could see that as fair. However the current practices of AI companies is to scrape data from everything everywhere without permission. Every single living human&rsquo;s work in their learning model is stolen. Their algorithms depend on that data to function, and all iterations of ai models are built on stolen work. If we don&rsquo;t regulate this now at the start, even the ai company &lsquo;dreams&rsquo; of being the ultimate tool will fail and they&rsquo;ll be simply competing to see who can make the most capital by stealing. <br/><br/>Let&rsquo;s picture a world in the future where you, this reader, retire. And in your retirement you find some joy in painting or writing. Maybe it&rsquo;s the unique way you see yourself in things. Or maybe you can capture the feeling you get from being with your loved ones. You paint a portrait of your children, or loved one, and every brushstroke, every color you place has a memory. And the work is gorgeous! It&rsquo;s beautiful and it&rsquo;s uniquely your own. You post in on Facebook to share that love you feel with the world. And then the next week you see your painting style, the brushstrokes, the colors, however you were imagining reflecting yourself in it, front in center on a Coca-Cola advertisement. Some business executive decided they liked your work and put it into a database, typed in &lsquo;*your name*&rsquo;s style pretty lady enjoying a Coca Cola. Logo facing the camera&rsquo; and churned your work through a &lsquo;copy but slightly different&rsquo; machine for profit. Maybe you don&rsquo;t even mind because you&rsquo;re retired, but put that same situation to your children, who are so inspired by you to find their careers by creating what they love. Every piece they make is just slapped through a database. No credit, no payment, nothing. To survive they have  to get minimum wage jobs cleaning or in retail. They try and try again to create for a living, and everything they do is repeatedly absorbed into the AI industry. Your own child&rsquo;s work and style, their reflections of themselves, is presented by some tech guy who paid for their followers as the latest and newest AI model. There&rsquo;s so many ways for this to play out, and none are good for the individuals, the humans. Even if your kids were to adapt to match the &lsquo;adapt or die&rsquo; slogan so popularly spewed by ai fanatics, as soon as they created anything unique with AI, it would get chewed up and stolen by another. That is a nightmare scenario that we are hurtling full speed towards right now. <br/><br/>Even from a capital and company perspective, why would you ever invest in being the first one to innovate, when it&rsquo;s cheaper to wait for someone else to and then feed that through your ai machine. Ai wouldn&rsquo;t fuel innovation, it would empower the copy cats and the thieves, and discourage any creative endeavors at all. Why pay a 10 man marketing team 1 million for a year when you could pay one person to feed someone else&rsquo;s marketing efforts through a legal copy machine. <br/><br/>When artists are screaming at legislation to please do something about this, it&rsquo;s not about trying to make a ton of money or getting credit. We just want to live, we just want to express ourselves in the most base caveman human way with creativity. even people who want to use AI to express themselves fit in too, but without any legislation changes on protecting data and protecting individuals, The world will devolve into theft for capital for generations until someone can undo our wrongs.
