AI art should not be copyrighted,<br/>the corporations will destroy the AI industry if its allowed.<br/><br/>They will literally copyright everything and patent it, even a brush stroke.<br/><br/>I think its really bad idea.<br/><br/>We already have so many corporations sitting on patents, and its a nightmare.<br/><br/>Just look at music industry, they literally copyrighted sound notes, you cannot even make music you want because you get sued.
