I believe that AI generated text, images, video, or audio should not be able to be copyrighted, and that the people using AI to generate any of the aforementioned content retain no authorship over the generated content. It is common knowledge, and you have likely already been linked many a article, that most AI generated image programs are trained with datasets they do not have legal ownership over, so it would be outrageous to allow these images and generations built off of others, potentially already copyrighted, works to be copyrighted themselves.
