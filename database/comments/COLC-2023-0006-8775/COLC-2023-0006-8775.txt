Artificial intelligence programs such as ChatGPT allow for individuals to use data they don&#39;t have explicit permission to use, very often works that have been unilaterally scraped and added to a database while still under copyright protection, to then create text. This text has the potential to be misleading, to be wildly incorrect, and occasionally to be dangerous. Artificial intelligence doesn&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; the way a person does, and it doesn&#39;t respect the bounds of creative license and style like a human creator does. ChatGPT and programs like it are plagiarism engines that mine for content and style while giving no credit or compensation to the creators who are being mimicked. It&#39;s a get-rich-quick-scheme, and it doesn&#39;t deserve the protection of copyright.
