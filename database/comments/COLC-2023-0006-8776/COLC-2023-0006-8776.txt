Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am an artist and performer who has been detrimentally impacted by AI models that have appropriated the copyrighted works and likenesses of myself and my peers. I appreciate that the Copyright Office, Judiciary Committees, and the FTC have hosted inquiries into to the harms generative AI poses to creators and to the general public, and that the Office has provided this opportunity for comment.<br/><br/>My attached answers to many of the questions posed by the Office will be concise for brevity, but I hope to illustrate how generative AI compounds existing issues in the violation and exploitation that artists and other creative workers endure because of ineffective protections for copyright holders in the Digital Age. The ease with which creative works can be copied and redistributed on the internet, largely without consequence for infringers, has already harmed the economic viability of artists to make a living pursuing their craft. Craft which requires several years, if not decades, of education, practice, and experimentation to develop into highly personal, unique, and marketable forms of expression.<br/><br/>Generative AI developers, depending on the sources of their models&#39; underlying &#39;training&#39; data, capitulate on lacking enforcement of data privacy and copyright on the web by harvesting media to populate their datasets with personal data and creative works. These creative works, many copyrighted, determine the quality of the outputs of generative AI models. Without &#39;ingesting&#39; the works and likenesses of artists, photographers, writers, musicians, actors, and even media from the general public, generative AI cannot generate. That AI corporations and developers, who benefit commercially from these models, as of yet are not being held to the same licensing standards as other businesses for the use of copyrighted works is appalling. <br/><br/>Creators must be given the option to grant or withhold licenses to their work and deserve to be compensated when they allow their intellectual property to be employed by AI systems. Without existing copyright protections being enforced and new copyright, data privacy, and publicity rights being implemented in regards to generative AI; creatives will have no incentive to invest in the development of their craft, display their creations on the internet, and, perhaps, even to create at all.  What incentive will artists like myself have to publish our works when AI can freely ingest them and directly compete with us by generating endless inexpensive derivatives?<br/><br/>Infringement via the non-consensual use of creative works and personal media for the purposes of training generative AI must be condemned by the law if American citizens are to maintain control of the fruits of their labor and even to their own voices and likenesses. If generative AI models and their outputs continue to be built from the unlicensed and uncompensated copyrighted works and labor of artists and other creators- Copyright, in essence, will cease to exist.<br/><br/>Once again, thank you for allowing the public and creators like myself to comment on copyright and the current harms of generative AI, as well as the necessary steps that must be taken to ensure that exploitation is not the modus operandi of AI development going into the future.  <br/><br/>-Chelle E.G. <br/><br/>Note: I am writing to the Office in this public comment pseudo-anonymously because of the abuse I have witnessed being directed at artists by generative AI proponents. <br/><br/>Should the Copyright Office and US government officially uphold copyright holders&#39; exclusive rights and establish publicity rights to defend US citizens from exploitative AI, it would bring a measure of peace to artists and performers who are currently being harassed for attempting to protect their works and likeness.<br/><br/>Attached is a personal accounting of experienced and witnessed harms to myself and fellow artists and performers- as well as my answers to questions posed by the Copyright Office with citations to relevant articles and papers.
