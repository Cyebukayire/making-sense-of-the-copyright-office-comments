Please regulate AI so it is not stealing from artists and designers to be &ldquo;trained&rdquo; and so that it&rsquo;s not taking these creative jobs. AI was promised to do jobs that people don&rsquo;t want. Creative jobs are desirable, so AI should not be allowed to do these jobs for us. We can&rsquo;t compete with AI that virtually works for free and advertisers and corporations don&rsquo;t care that the quality isn&rsquo;t good. Left unchecked AI is gutting industries like writing, film, interior design (my industry), and much more. We&rsquo;ve already lost many jobs and can&rsquo;t hold on in these industries much longer if made to compete with AI. This isn&rsquo;t creative destruction, this is purely destruction of work that brings joy and meaning. These are not tools that make our work easier, they are taking valuable IP from artists/designers to bolster the work of those outside of the field or to make art less distinct within. Meanwhile intensive labor jobs are left for humans because it&rsquo;s expensive to build/standardize robots for that. I urge you to prevent this take over of creatives&rsquo; livelihoods and the loss of a quintessential part of human culture: diverse art and design. Not to mention much AI is trained on biased media that perpetuates harmful stereotypes and bolsters systemic inequality. AI cannot be allowed to develop in this manner, with much VC pouring into types of AI that is already causing great harm.
