AI text-to-image models are trained on the works of living artists without their consent, credit, or compensation. As an illustrator, I&rsquo;ve found more than 3K of my own works (often multiple copies) in the LAION 5B database (via haveibeentrained.com). <br/><br/>LAION 5B has been created for research, but AI/ML companies are utilizing it for profit.<br/><br/>By allowing users to prompt names of artists, text-to-image generators can produce an infinite number of images resembling, or &ndash; in an effect called overfitting &ndash; even directly copying the work of human artists. <br/><br/>This is an appropriation not only of the work and style, but also of the skill, experience, perspective, ultimately of the entire personality of the respective artist &ndash; and if generated works are being used in direct commercial competition with the works of that very artist, it&rsquo;s even expropriation. <br/><br/>Unlike humans, AIs wouldn&rsquo;t be able to produce anything without being trained on all these works. They&rsquo;re only as good as the work scraped into their dataset.<br/><br/>The replacement of artists through AI has already begun: AI-generated images are widely used and sold, forcing artists to compete with cheap derivatives of their own artworks. Instead of licensing or commissioning art directly from the artists, people and companies use image generators, redirecting the already limited income of artists to tech giants. I don&rsquo;t think this could by any means be called fair use. <br/><br/>In the long run, this practice will render the very concept of copyright meaningless. Artists are already reluctant to publish their new works online, and while they are being replaced by imitations of their own works, art as a career is becoming impossible. <br/><br/>As text-to-image models create images based on probability and statistics, they&#39;re susceptible to reproducing not only copyrighted works, but also biases and stereotypes. If we let AI replace artists, at this point in time, we&rsquo;ll be indefinitely stuck, unable to evolve and overcome those biases and stereotypes.<br/><br/>Without regulations to keep AI generative software in check, we&#39;re already seeing deep fakes and misinformation. AI generative software makes it so easy for everyone to create and spread that!  <br/><br/>Furthermore, AI text-to-image generators completely devalue and randomize art, and the most human act of creating things with mind, hands and heart. When AIs imitate human art, all the personality, the knowledge, the curiosity and the learning, the love and the pain, the lovingly placed details, and the stories those details tell at second or third sight, become completely random, and thereby irrelevant. <br/> <br/>If we continue on this path, some artists of my generations may still find work, but for future generations, there will be no point in learning artistic skills, and to actually create. Can you imagine telling a child that the one thing they&#39;re really good at and that makes them truly happy is not a possible career, but a bot job?<br/><br/>I think we &ndash; and not only the artists, but all of us! &ndash; have the responsibility to not let that happen!<br/><br/>First of all, we need transparency &ndash; both for training data and for generated images. Generated images need to clearly show that and how they&rsquo;re generated.<br/><br/>But most importantly, artists absolutely need to have the choice if they want to give permission to their works becoming part of AI training (&bdquo;Opt-in&ldquo;). Furthermore, artists that decide to participate absolutely need to be credited and compensated, in a fair relation to that use. <br/>
