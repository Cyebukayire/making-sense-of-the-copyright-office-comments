As a digital artist who takes great care to respect other artist&#39;s works, it concerns me greatly how our work and privacy can be so easily disregarded when pursuing the almightly dollar. Over the past year, I&#39;ve watched AI creators and their customers justify their theft through false arguments and general ignorance on how artists learn, develop their styles and become inspired. People are not algorithms. A person can view a painting, or read a passage of text and become inspired by a memory unrelated, or even by what they noticed wasn&#39;t there. AI generated images, text and video cannot be regarded the same. Generative AI is theft as it directly copies artist&#39;s works.
