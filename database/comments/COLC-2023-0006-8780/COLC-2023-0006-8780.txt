Hello.<br/><br/>I want to start this comment with some background. I have worked in education, writing, data analytics, and have a plethora of experience with Voice Actors, Artists, and script/book writers.<br/><br/>Generative AI is a tool that takes all of those things the above hard working people have created, smashes them together, and creates a facsimile of that work. You already see companies today trying to use AI to replace humans, a practice that, in-part, led to the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild strikes. It does not take hard to find the same sentiment among independent artists whose very livelihood is threatened by tools that are more and more commonly being used to replace hours of hard, practiced, work to pump out work in minutes or hours of far lesser quality. Generative AI has not created a single ounce of unique work that was not trained off of the work of humans that made it and had their work illegally stolen to do so.<br/><br/>While large corporate entities may see this as an win for their bottom lines, it does real harm to individuals whose work falls into whatever models the AI is trained on. We have seen voice actors having their voices and likeness used to say things they have never said and have never acted in. This happens both in large scale and more independent scales. We have seen the Lovecraftian-esque horrors that are produced from AI generated digital art, and how those are continuously being trained to the point they&#39;re being used to replace artists for advertisements and animation. We have seen AI generated photos that were trained on the likeness and photos of real people, without consent, and used to create monstrous uncanny valley images and false scenes of war or strife that have no basis in reality but are being reported as if they. We have seen tools like ChatGPT-4 make life horrible for students trying to do honest work in their schooling by &quot;AI Detection Tools&quot; falsely flagging work they have written and spent hours and hours of their lives working on without the use of such tools. We&#39;ve seen AI generated books and scripts, some of which have been used for games and attempted to be used for movies and tv shows, which cost real writers their ability to find jobs because their work was used to train a tool to replace them for a fraction of the cost.<br/><br/>Nothing a Generative AI tool creates, nothing any AI that is currently on the market creates, is created by itself. All of their datasets of voices, writings, artwork and photos, were scraped from the internet or provided by other entities that were usually not the people that created the works themselves. Since they are not creating anything, they are often trained on stolen, scraped, data and they have no ability to think, feel, or create anything that is outside of its datasets there should be no ability to copyright any of the work used. AI is nothing more than a tool that is being misused and mishandled and ultimately, at present, causes more harm than good and that will accelerate should generative AI be allowed to have materials copyrighted.<br/><br/>Until such a time where more solid laws, regulations, and restrictions on the creation and use of AI exist it is a tool that is nothing more than an expensive thief in pretty packaging that makes their living off of doing real harm to real people despite being an artificial system that lacks any semblance of intelligence at all.
