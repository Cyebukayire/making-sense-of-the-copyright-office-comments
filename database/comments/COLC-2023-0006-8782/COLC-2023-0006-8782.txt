My work, my art, my time and effort are not databanks for people to exploit and create cheap copies of, people are losing jobs because it is cheaper to steal our art than hire us<br/>Tools like glaze and nightshade are the only things i trust right now, they are the only things that keep me from stopping sharing art altogether<br/>Ai image generators are exploitative and who made them is a thief who prioritize money and gain above anything else
