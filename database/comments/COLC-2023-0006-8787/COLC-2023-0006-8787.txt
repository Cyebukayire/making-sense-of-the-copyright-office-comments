I should NOT have to compete with a product that is made from MY work that is taken in an unlawful, unconsented way. <br/><br/>Opt-out doesn&#39;t work for numerous reasons, and it should not be on us ARTISTS go around and figure out what and which dataset has taken our work to train their models on. Datasets for AI training MUST be on opt-in consented basis, made in an explicit way - not buried somewhere in a term of service agreement where it&#39;s purposefully made vague in it&#39;s language.<br/><br/>Any datasets that are made on PUBLIC work MUST be open to the public.
