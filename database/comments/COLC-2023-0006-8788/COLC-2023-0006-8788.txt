Dear all,<br/><br/>Any images, text, or video used for training ML models should be viewed exclusively as raw material for commercial software products.<br/><br/>Any anthropomorphization of ML software to legitimize data extraction from copyrighted works as &quot;learning&quot; should be viewed as dishonest.<br/><br/>Essentially, what we currently have is harvesting copyrighted works as raw material for massively market-disrupting commercial software products that directly compete with the creators whose work was harvested without any permission or compensation. Such practice is deeply unfair and should be made illegal.<br/><br/>Thank you.
