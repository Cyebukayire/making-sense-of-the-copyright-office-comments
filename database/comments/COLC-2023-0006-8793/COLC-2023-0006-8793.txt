I don&#39;t have an opinion on whether AI output should be subject to copyright. However, I think that disallowing training on copyrighted content would be one of the worst decisions the U.S. could ever make. Open-source AI is the most important innovations in the past few years, and killing it through regulation and Copyright would give foreign countries a much better position. The U.S. Copyright Office needs to take a staunchly pro-AI stance.
