When it comes to artificial intelligence, it has the potential to negatively affect copyright of any property to exist. As opposed to fan works and parody&rsquo;s, generative artificial intelligence works by Directly copying the source material and is used primarily as a means to circumvent official releases. It can be used as a means of piracy, and using someone&rsquo;s style. I artificial intelligence should never get copyright over any work, since that would lead to extreme abuse of the copyright system and an extreme abundance of spam, since these programs can generate thousands upon thousands of pieces in under 10 minutes.
