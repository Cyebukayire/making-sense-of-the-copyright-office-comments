I use AI in digital commercial advertising work constantly.  I understand how AI works and feel that the current discussion regarding AI suffers from a great deal of misinformation.  Many believe AI is &quot;compositing&quot; images from other creators - but in fact, AI is learning how to create from looking at those other images. Not a single pixel is &quot;copied&quot;.  Thus, AI cannot be considered a copyright violation any more than a child learning to draw by looking at existing comics/artwork is.  Are there ethical implications to using copyrighted images as training data without permission? Perhaps, but it&#39;s an ethical dilemma, not a legal one.
