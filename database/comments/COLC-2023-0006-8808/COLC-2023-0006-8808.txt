October 30, 2023<br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern: <br/><br/>The National Football League (the &ldquo;NFL&rdquo;) is pleased to provide these comments in response to the Notice of Inquiry published by the U.S. Copyright Office (the <br/><br/>&ldquo;Copyright Office&rdquo;) on August 30, 2023 regarding artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) and copyright (the &ldquo;NOI&rdquo;).  See 88 FR 59942. <br/><br/>The NFL is America&rsquo;s most popular professional sports league and produces much of the most recognizable and valuable copyrighted material in the world.  The NFL&rsquo;s marquee event, the Super Bowl, is the world&rsquo;s most globally viewed annual sporting event.  For example, the Super Bowl LVII game, which took place on February 12, 2023, was watched by approximately 200 million viewers &ndash; or 60% of all people in the United States &ndash; on television and digital platforms.  Globally, more than 56 million fans, from Mexico to China, from Australia to Brazil, and many other countries around the world, watched the Super Bowl LVII game.  The NFL produces and distributes not only copyrighted content from NFL games, but also a host of broadcast productions through NFL Films and NFL Network, as well as numerous digital and online properties.  The NFL has expended significant time and resources not only developing and producing its copyrighted content for the enjoyment of fans across the world, but also protecting that content so that it is not vulnerable to those who want to improperly infringe, exploit and profit from the NFL&rsquo;s intellectual property. <br/><br/>The NFL recognizes the tremendous potential of AI to improve and expand technological development.  However, without appropriate protections for rights holders like the NFL who create unique copyrighted content, AI could also adversely impact the value of that content, thereby discouraging businesses from investing in the creation of intellectual property, and dramatically increase infringement of intellectual property rights.  Additionally, the use of NFL content without permission could lead to a proliferation of AI-generated &ldquo;deep fakes&rdquo; that are derived from NFL intellectual property or the likenesses of NFL personnel, including players, coaches and officials.  Such deep fakes could be used to spread misinformation regarding, and to profit from, NFL intellectual property and personas. <br/><br/>As with previous technological advancements, AI innovation and copyright protection are not mutually exclusive.  Existing approaches and recent developments in AI, such as model builders licensing certain content for training purposes and the availability of models trained solely on authorized content, demonstrate that there are reasonable and functional methods for AI model training that do not undermine copyright protections afforded to rights holders.  To that end, curators of training datasets and developers of AI models should not be permitted to use copyrighted material to build such datasets or train models without affirmative authorization or a license from the applicable copyright owners that accurately accounts for both the individualized value of the content ingested and the resulting value of the dataset created or AI model built. <br/><br/>The NFL understands that this is a nascent and rapidly changing technology.  As AI development and use cases evolve, copyright holders, regulators, and policymakers will have a better understanding of the risks and opportunities that this technology presents.  It is important that the federal legislation and regulations governing AI continue to reflect this changing landscape.  The NFL appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback to the Copyright Office on these important issues and welcomes the opportunity to further engage in discussions regarding the impact of AI on copyright law.<br/><br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/><br/>Brendon Plack <br/>Senior Vice President, Government Relations
