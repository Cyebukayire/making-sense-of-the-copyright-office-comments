Romance Writers of America (RWA) supports all creators of works of romance fiction along with all creators when protecting their intellectual property. RWA feels it is imperative to protect the rights of those with intellectual property to retain the right as to how that property is used or manipulated and the right to expect compensation for any use afforded a third party by the intellectual property owner. It is therefore, in RWA&rsquo;s view, imperative to deny copyright access to any works that include AI use without express permission from the intellectual property owner. Not only to protect creators and their property, but also to protect the quality of the products generated for the readers of romance or any creative industry where creative property is featured or copyrighted.
