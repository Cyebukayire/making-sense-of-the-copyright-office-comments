The evidence that AI images is theft would be seen in programs like Nightshade. It masks an image with an invisible layer that is not detectable to the original piece but when placed in an AI generator messes the picture up. It shows that the image was taken without the artist&#39;s consent and the AI itself is not at all &quot;learning&quot; as many would claim. It&#39;s is theft and such programs like Nightshade proves this. Period.
