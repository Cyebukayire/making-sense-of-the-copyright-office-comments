AI text-image models are trained on the works of living artists, without their consent, acknowledgement or compensation.  <br/><br/>By allowing users to type in artists&#39; names, text-image generators can produce an infinite number of images that all too closely resemble the works of human artists. <br/><br/>This is not only an appropriation of the work and style, but also of the skill, experience, perspective and personality of the artist. If the generated works are used in commercial competition with the artist&#39;s works, it is even an expropriation. <br/><br/>Unlike humans, AIs would not be able to produce anything without being trained on all these works. They are only as good as the works contained in their data set.<br/><br/>LAION 5B was created for research, but AI/ML companies use it for profit.<br/><br/>The replacement of artists by AI has already begun: AI-generated images are widely used and sold, forcing artists to compete with cheap derivatives of their own artwork. Instead of licensing or commissioning artwork directly from artists, people and companies are using image generators and diverting artists&#39; already limited income to tech giants. This is not fair use. <br/><br/>Artists are already reluctant to publish new work online, and as they are replaced by imitations of their own work, art as a profession is becoming increasingly impossible. <br/><br/>Because text-image models create images based on probabilities and statistics, they are vulnerable to reproducing not only copyrighted works, but also prejudices and stereotypes. If we allow AI to replace artists, we will not be able to evolve and overcome these prejudices and stereotypes.<br/><br/>Without regulations, there are already a lot of deep fakes and misinformation, and it is only getting more. Generative AI software makes it so easy for anyone to create and spread these!  <br/><br/>Furthermore, AI text-to-image generators completely devalue art and the most human act of creation, making it random. When AI imitates human art, all the personality, knowledge, curiosity and learning, the lovingly placed details and the stories those details tell become completely random and irrelevant. <br/> <br/>If we continue down this path, some artists of my generation may still find work, but for future generations there will be no point in learning any artistic skills, and creating at all. <br/><br/>I think we have a responsibility not to let that happen!<br/><br/>First of all, we need transparency - both in training data and in generated images. With generated images, it must be clear that they were generated, and how. <br/><br/>Most importantly, it is imperative that artists have a choice as to whether they want to give their consent for their works to become part of the AI training (&quot;opt-in&quot;). Furthermore, it is imperative that artists who choose to participate are credited and compensated in proportion to that use.
