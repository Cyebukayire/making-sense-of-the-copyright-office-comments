Hello I am a graphic artist working in games for 17 years. Since ai image generators came up my studio forced me to use the generator or outsourced work from low wage countries to clean up. My job have been miserable since then. On top my personal art from portfolio sites where used to train those generators found in the LAION datasets all others are not transparent. It&rsquo;s unfair and unethical to use my and that of my peers work without consent or compensation.
