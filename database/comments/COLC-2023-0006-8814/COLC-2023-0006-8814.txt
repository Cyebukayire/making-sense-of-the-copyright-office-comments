Artists need to be protected from Ai companies and copyright is one way.  No other industry can get away legally with stealing copyrighted art, why should Ai companies be different?  Glaze and nightshade are being made to protect artists because no one else is doing it. Please don&rsquo;t let Ai images be copyrighted, it&rsquo;s unethical.  Ai companies need to get consent, give compensation and credit to all artists. <br/>Art Students are scared they have no future in the arts. Professional artists are scared they have no future as artists. The whole industry is fighting.
