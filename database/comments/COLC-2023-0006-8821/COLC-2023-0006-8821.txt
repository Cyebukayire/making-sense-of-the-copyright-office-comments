Hello, I&#39;m a freelance artist and twitch streamer from Australia. In it&#39;s current unregulated state Ai is definitely impacting my ability to work in a negative capacity. I&#39;ve seen my twitch numbers drop from double digits to single digits, and my commissions are all but non-existent currently as people find it cheaper and easier to get art better than I currently can do using AI. I&#39;ve been studying and working as a freelance artist for the past 5 years and doing art casually for another 10 years prior. For me it is as if suddenly all avenues of art in my field have been flooded with ai art to the point where i&#39;m almost undiscoverable with the sheer volume of art being pumped out and being spread online. <br/>As far as ai models go, stable diffusion is by far the biggest offender given it is locally installed, and models are being made with far less images by the community to get results based on specific artists styles or subjects. What was originally models using billions of images have been cut to just a few thousand images, and trained directly on the top 10000 or so art pieces by the best artists in the field. That makes a huge difference as the image generation quality improves dramatically but it also removes a lot of the randomness making it even more likely to copy specific artists styles directly, as well as even at times copy parts of their art used depending on the training. It can be seen with the copying of signatures which some models do. Artists such as personalami or zackary911 etc, when called on by the ai, usually get very close ai approximations of their signatures for example. <br/>When you add in extensions such as controlnet, which lets the ai copy poses, composition etc from images loaded into it, users can remove even more of the relevant randomness of ai to mimic core parts of the art  to us artists. <br/>The program itself may be masquerading as a tool for making random art, but it very much is being used to replicate living, working artists and their styles to directly compete not only with the original artists, but given the quality also stifling and up and coming artists such as myself since it&#39;s trained fully on people who&#39;d normally be my inspiration and betters rather than my own competition. <br/>Its basically been designed to replace and remove all but the top artists in their fields, and even then directly compete with them. <br/>As an artist basically we train our entire lives to develop our skills in one specific areas, ie mine is digital art. It&#39;s as if all of our training so that we can work as artists has been then taken wholesale and placed into the hands of someone else who then benefits from our hard work but also gets to enjoy their own entire lives set of skills without a fair trade. An analogy would be a mechanic. As an artist i could be commissioned by the mechanic to do art. He&#39;d pay me, and then he&#39;d have art and i&#39;d have money, which in turn i&#39;d be able to pay him to fix my car. With ai in the mix, that same mechanic now can download a model, type in a simple prompt using my name, get art in my style without paying me, and now me  without the commission i would normally have gotten if he&#39;d wanted art in my style, have no money to get my car fixxed, but the mechanic still gets the art. That&#39;s how it&#39;s impacting us currently, except on a massive scale, since now anyone with a pc can rip off our art styles by using our names from models trained on our work without our consent, designed to replace and remove us and our ability to work
