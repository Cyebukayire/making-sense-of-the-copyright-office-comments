I do not want my work to be scrapped by AI without my permission and compensation. It takes years of blood sweat and tears to hone a craft and tonfinakly benifit my lively hood. to be taken by some bloated billion dollar company to make a profit off of artist is shameful and needs to be illegal. Generative AI need to be illegal. an individual needs to make a living i choose art. If my art is being taken without my consent that is a violation of my person. It&#39;s a little like a sexual assault. The act was not consensual but was taken advantage anyway. That&#39;s Illegal and can be detrimental to the one that was assaulted. So no I do not want generative AI touch anything creative with consent with the individual.
