AI generated images are made by stealing IP and they have no real creative input, if they receive copyright it would be the end of the artistic industry as we know it. It&#39;s already hard to compete against other humans artists, I really don&acute;t like the idea of competing against machines as well, the human input is nothing more than general directions about the desired output, AI image generator users are nothing more than clients asking someone, in this case something, to do art for them.
