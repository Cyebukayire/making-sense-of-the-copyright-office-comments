Generative AI is extremely exploitive dystopian. AI has been useful for other aspects of life, but using it for art is inhumane and unethical. Giving away a core value of the human experience, the desire and ability to create to a machine is dystopian and cruel. The databases for generative AI need to be reset and trained on ONLY royalty free images and should by no means be for commercial use.
