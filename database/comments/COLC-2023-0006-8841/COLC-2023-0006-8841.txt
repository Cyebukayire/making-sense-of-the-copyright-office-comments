I think AI can have incredible potential and benefits, but can also be terribly harmful. I&rsquo;d like to see legislation that protects creators, keeping copyrights in the hands of authors and preventing works from being used to train AI models without authors&rsquo; knowledge or permission. I&rsquo;d also like to see the door kept open for AI applications that can assist disabled creators with their work. I believe there can be a middle way, rather than outright banning AI or going full throttle without thought to the ramifications. As a working writer with a disability, I&rsquo;m cautiously optimistic and hopeful that we can create legislation that keeps AI in check, especially if legislators and artists work together along with programmers.
