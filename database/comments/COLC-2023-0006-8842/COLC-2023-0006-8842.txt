GENERATIVE AI STYLE TRANSFER PROBLEM AND 4 PART SOLUTION<br/><br/>SOLUTIONS to the emerging Style Transfer problem contains four elements:<br/>!) RECOGNITION by artists, writers, musicians that Generative AI Style Transfer is not going away. Gen AI Style Transfer as a feature of software is likely to scale larger, becoming available to greater numbers of people, enabling less skilled persons to prompt the generation of numerous derivative outputs in texts, images, sounds, music, computer source code.<br/><br/>2) Authors, artists musicians need to CREATE THEIR OWN MODELS of their own works. By training their own TensorFlow, ML/AI models, digitally signing the models, officiating the models and publishing, licensing, selling the models for a fee. In this way, creative persons that now generate income from selling their traditional works will still participate in the new income stream. Creative persons who take control of their style of their brand, officiate their own Style Transfer models- win back their style from upstart corporations who would otherwise profit from artist&rsquo;s  existing catalog of works. Creative persons who participate in controlling how their models create derivatives of their works will lead and have some control of their income stream. Instead of sitting back and complaining that they cannot do anything about Style Transfer. Creative persons can train a ML model on the catalog of their works, author, publish and sell/license their own (official artist endorsed) ML model on existing platforms- thereby generating new streams of income for themselves.<br/><br/>3) SERVICE PROVIDERS PARTICIPATION <br/>Service providers and e-commerce platform providers such as Apple iTunes Store, Google Play, Audible already sell music and books by publishing companies, authors and musicians.  The same platforms could sell &ldquo;official&rdquo;, signed, officiated AI/ML models created by a author or musician. A purchasable, downloadable model, purchasable and downloadable just like a book or song. The model locked to the one purchaser&rsquo;s device plugging into a existing or new software app. Each new derivative work outputted on a customer&rsquo;s device could generate a small fee, or a monthly service fee for using the capability of generating new output in the style of a user&rsquo;s favorite artist, musician, author. In this way, the original artist, content creator stays in the economic loop, participates in the marketplace and has some control over works derivatives being created. A similar contractual, ML model licensing method may be deliverable through publishing corporations and platform providers such as: Apple iTunes Store, Google Play, YouTube, Spotify, Amazon Books, Audible, Apple TV, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney, PiXAR, HBO, Paramount, Sony, Universal, Warner.<br/><br/>4) UPGRADE, UPDATE TITLE 17. <br/>Authors, musicians and other creative persons need to write and tell each of their elected US Representatives to sponsor and pass legislation adjusting, updating Title 17 US Copyright Law to provide for &ldquo;opting out &ldquo;of allowing a work to be used in machine learning model training without author&rsquo;s written consent. AND- in the copyright registration system, e-co, when a copyright is registered, as part of the workflow, provide a check box to formally declare that this author, musician &rsquo;opts out&rsquo; of having his or her work(s) used in the machine learning model training process without his or her written, legal consent. The work  creator then achieves a legal foundation in controlling who makes ML models based on the author&rsquo;s portfolio of works. Secondly, in the publicly viewable copyright record for a registration, a note explaining- &lsquo;Original author &#39;opts out&#39;, does NOT agree to having this work used in machine learning model training, unless approved by the author in written, agreed, legal consent.&rsquo;<br/><br/>Attached file contains definition of Style Transfer problem and 4 solutions. <br/>Survey form field did not support 3 pages of text.
