To whom it may concern, I am a professional in the art and design industry and the subject of AI generated artwork has become increasingly important in the work that we do. Primarily, we are an e-commerce marketplace that allows galleries to offer pieces of artwork for sale, and our reputation as a trustworthy marketplace is incredibly important. With the popularity of AI generated artwork, the subject of copyright has been at the forefront. As an individual that has dedicated their life to this industry, I want to support the sale of beautifully created artwork and also protect the artist that create this work. I am also very familiar with contemporary art, both fine art and more illustrative work. It is incredibly alarming to see the large amount of AI generated art that directly copies and steals work from small makers and artists. These artists have not consented to their work being part of this database and we must do everything we can to ensure that consent has been considered in AI. Further, I want to clarify that I understand the nuance of inspired art and styles, and those of us within the industry all recognize the role that inspiration takes when creating new work. AI generated art does not do this and instead forges and fakes. We have increasing dispute cases with artists and their legal representation and I can only foresee this continuing if we do not make a stance on AI generated work, as well as holding these programs and their makers responsible. This is wildly unpopular and it has only hurt artists and makers. We have seen this with recent illustrative work from movie studios where an artist would have been commissioned and yet AI was utilized instead. At its very core, copyright and ownership must be involved with anything AI to ensure authorship is protected.
