Generative AI scrapes existing copyrighted content without the consent of the copyright holders in order to function. These models do not function without this act of theft. In fact, many companies with generative AI models even encourage users to utilize prompts to instruct the AI model to imitate the hard-earned style of an artist or writer whose work they have stolen. The very purpose of copyright law is to protect someone&#39;s work and give them authority over how it is used, all the moreso when profit is involved. The authority to decide whether one&#39;s work is permissible for use in training AI models, particularly those owned by for-profit companies, should fall under that protection. This is obvious, and anyone arguing otherwise is seeking to undermine copyright law for their own enrichment.
