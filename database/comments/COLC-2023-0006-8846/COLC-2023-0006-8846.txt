To use other people&#39;s art without consent is piracy and should be treated as such. It is fine for AI generators to exist, but they must follow the traditional licensing practices as everything else. Artists must be asked for permission and paid compensation. There has to be a controlled, approved database from which AI generators train their models, like how photographers upload pictures to stock photo sites. Furthermore, all AI art must be tagged and identified as such, not only to protect artists, but to protect real life people whose likeness might be used to create convincing fakes. This should also be the case with AI voice generators. Any person who has had their art or likeness used without their consent must be given immediate compensation, and the person responsible for the crime must be subjected to a DMCA takedown. We already have all the tools for these regulations to take place, they must simply be put to use.
