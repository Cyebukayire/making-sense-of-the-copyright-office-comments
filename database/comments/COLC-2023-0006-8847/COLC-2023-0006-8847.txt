Unregulated AI is not good for businesses or consumers. AI will be used as an excuse to plagiarize and steal intellectual copyright without taking responsibility. If a machine cannot take responsibility for an action, that machine should not be placed in positions of decision making power. Though it is impossible to completely reverse the spread of AI in all industries, the bare minimum should be to restrict the use of image generator AI. Without even considering the economical implications, the ethics of images created by AI are dubious at best, dire at worst. Unregulated and unrestricted creation of images using another person&#39;s image or intellectual property should not be allowed. As citizens of the United States of Amercia, we pride ourselves on our right to privacy and freedom. There is no freedom in a society where anyone can take your face and use it to market a product, or worse, use it to created media for debauched activities. Please take action before AI does more harm to society.
