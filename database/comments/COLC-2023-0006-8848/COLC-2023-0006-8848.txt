AI, or more so generative AI, is built upon the exploitation of human artists and creatives; encouraging mass data theft by various individuals and companies. It uses the same data as the ones it has scraped from to endanger the jobs of creatives, and it relies on the work of other people, also showing it to only work using already existing data. Human creatives must be protected from data theft and have their copyright strengthened - in no way having their data stolen and exploited by other people and companies, and unethical development of AI/ generative AI must be stopped. It is important to prioritize the safety of the people and their data, and this could also be achieved by adapting and creating laws that will protect artists, creatives, and anyone posting content online, from AI.
