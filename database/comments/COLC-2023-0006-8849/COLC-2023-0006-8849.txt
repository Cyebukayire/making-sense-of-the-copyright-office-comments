While AI could be a resourceful tool, it seems to neglect to acknowledge or cite the output&rsquo;s sources. Further, it seems to, at best, appropriate or, at worst, steal other creators work without credit or license. I believe all creators should be paid for their work as well as credited. All AI should credit the original creator(s) and pay licensing if AI is generating income from that output. Thank you.
