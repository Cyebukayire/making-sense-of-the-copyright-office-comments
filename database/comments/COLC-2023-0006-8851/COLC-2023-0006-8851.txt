1. It affects the mentioned groups bc they cannot compete with the output of generative ai, not to mention that generative ai is highly dependent on consuming and spitting out derivatives of said work to even function. Copyright as it is currently, is given but not acknowledged in the legal field unless registered. This is useless to people residing outside of the United States. The hobbyists, the amateurs, also deserve a space to develop their craft without the negative sentiment that comes with generative ai output - humans as individuals are competing with the best that is scraped and turned into a slush machine by generative ai. Individual creators also do not have the power to consistently reinforce copyright with these ai companies due to global issues - copyright is hard to reinforce worldwide unless one is a major corporation, and major corporations are the ones pushing generative ai. On a more general threat - gen AI is a threat to democracy through the use of false messages, videos, images and more to push propaganda to the general public who simply cannot tell the difference, or who do not care to tell the difference.<br/><br/>2. The increasing use of AI-generative materials directly cuts out the bottom rung of artist jobs, a field that is directly affected through replacement technologies such as generative ai. For young beginner artists to cut their teeth, and to have intrinsic motivation to progress to the mid level progress of an art career, they need these jobs that are directly being cut out by genAI. The dwindling number of young artists who can create and who are the foundation of our creative industries is at risk, which in turn stifles the United States&#39; cultural power. This effect can already be seen in Hollywood where the &quot;mid &quot; film does not exist - it is either extremely indie or mega blockbusters. genAI will worsen that effect to an extreme degree, benefiting only the people at the top. <br/>3. https://ssir.org/articles/entry/ai-impact-on-jobs-and-work <br/>https://thehundred.substack.com/p/interview-daron-acemoglu-on-technology<br/>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681<br/>4. Unsure of approaches adopted in other countries, but international consistency is an important factor. Berne Convention in this regard, should be highly considered as an approach to follow due to globalisation.<br/>5. New legislation is warranted. It should entail audit of datasets and destruction of infringing material if there is no consent, transparency, credit and compensation to copyright holders. There needs to be a clear model of attribution and payment of use of copyrighted materials, not the spotify model or youtube or other comparable models given that gen ai models uniquely only function through the fitting on other materials.It is not a platform. It is a computer program.<br/><br/>6.1 The loophole on using materials acquired for research through third party entities and then turning into for-profit needs to be closed. This is how the Laion 5B dataset came into play and is the bedrock of gen AI models such as Stable Diffusion. Developers of AI models currently get their data through scraping of the internet in terms of image generators, and other LLM models get their data through illegal torrent sites. While preservation of text is a goal of those sites, it does not mean that the data provided through those sites are legal for the development of generative ai models.<br/><br/>6.2 I believe it is close to 100%. There are no licensing models being offered and used in the first versions of gen ai models. In terms of image generators, currently there is Shutterstock, Adobe FIrefly, Vizcom, that claim to train on their own images, however are merely fine tuned on existing models. Adobe Firefly does not vet if the images in their stock bank are made from ai or not. Both Shutterstock and Adobe do not allow their current contributors to opt out of ai training, and offer a mere pittance of payment without any transparency. <br/><br/>6.4 I don&#39;t believe the materials themselves are retained, however knowledge of those materials are retained, and cannot be untrained or deleted. These ai models often use links to copyrighted materials and claim that is considered Fair Use - however when said models are sold for profit and aim to replace a large portion of the populace jobs, I highly doubt that is the case. The only definitive way is to destroy current models and create new models using ethically obtained data.<br/><br/>7.4 - possible if you input a person&#39;s name in terms of image generators. Absent that, I would think it would be possible by asking image generators to output images similar to a base image(similar to bing&#39;s image search). In the case of chatgpt, asking chatgpt to summarize copyrighted stories.<br/><br/>9. Affirmly opt in. Everyone is affected and deserve consent.<br/><br/>10.1 - possible but will need some sort of legal or regulatory body. 10.2/ 10.,3 - IP lawyers, digital media lawyers would be best approached to figure out a licensing system<br/>
