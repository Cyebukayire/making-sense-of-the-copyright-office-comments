My name is Joshua S. Wattles.  I am a member of the California Bar and a former professor of Copyright Law at the University of Southern California, Loyola Law School in Los Angles and Southwestern University Law School also in Los Angeles.  I practice copyright law and have done so since graduating law school in 1978. My clients have included major authors, performers, composers, motion picture and television studios and producers as well as large websites, companies and individuals involved in new technologies. I participated as counsel to amicus in the Grokster litigation on the side of the developers of the protocols used for P2P file sharing and storage. I have also acted as a business executive in media and Internet companies.<br/><br/>This Comment is submitted in my individual capacity and not on behalf of any clients or former clients.<br/><br/>It is far too soon and too early to determine how the copyright law should respond to artificial intelligence developments.  Early responses by the Copyright Office and others attempting to impose the structure of the existing law of copyright onto the activity and process of artificial intelligence have been largely misguided in no small part because &quot;the glove don&#39;t fit.&quot; The management of AI will require legislative action and engage the political process. Let that play out some more. AI is a as much a cultural development as it it a technological marvel. Legislating it through notions of content ownership at this early stage threatens its potential contributions.<br/><br/>Thank You.<br/><br/>Joshua S. Wattles
