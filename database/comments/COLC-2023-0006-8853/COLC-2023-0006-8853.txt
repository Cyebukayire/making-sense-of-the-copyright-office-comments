As a music creator, I want to express my sincere appreciation for the Copyright Office&#39;s Notice of Inquiry concerning generative artificial intelligence and copyright. I believe that it is essential for the office to consider the perspective of artists, songwriters, producers, and other individual creative workers as we navigate this important topic. The decisions made in this context will have far-reaching implications for generations of creators, and I strongly advocate for preserving human creativity as the fundamental cornerstone of any future rules or regulations.<br/><br/>Generative AI is an exciting technological advancement that has significantly broadened the horizons of music creation, eliminating traditional barriers to entry and democratizing creativity. It serves as a powerful tool and instrument capable of unlocking unparalleled potential and pushing the boundaries of music making. However, we must also acknowledge the responsibility of ensuring that generative AI does not undermine or replace human creativity. It falls upon the Copyright Office to safeguard the interests of human creators in this evolving landscape.<br/><br/>In your endeavor to develop new rules and regulations governing generative AI, I urge you to take a strong stance against the widespread misuse and unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train AI models and systems. Music creators, especially independent artists, often find themselves powerless to prevent the unauthorized ingestion of their copyrighted content without their consent or due compensation. I am an independent music creator, and it is disheartening to imagine a future where someone could take my work and generate new works that I have no control over. It&#39;s important to me and my fellow creatives that we are protected from being exploited.<br/><br/>I encourage the reinforcement of copyright law principles designed to incentivize and protect human creativity. It is crucial to ensure that outputs generated by AI models do not infringe on existing copyrighted materials. No individual should have to compete against a technology that infringes upon their own work and potentially displaces them from the market.<br/><br/>I deeply appreciate the Copyright Office&#39;s willingness to engage with and listen to the concerns of creators and working professionals who are most directly affected by the impact of generative AI. Your consideration of these recommendations is essential in maintaining a balanced and fair ecosystem for creators in the age of evolving technology.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and attention to this critical matter.
