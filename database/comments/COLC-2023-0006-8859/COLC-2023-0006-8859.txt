AI currently scrapes anything and everything with no regard to the ownership of the content that it&rsquo;s scraping, or whether or not the owner is okay with that. Currently, the opt-out system is not a serious solution (it should be an opt-in system, rather than assuming the content is okay to scrape if no action is taken).<br/><br/>I don&rsquo;t believe AI in itself is bad, but I do believe the way things are being run is reckless. As an illustrator, it&rsquo;s disheartening to think that the art I work so hard to create can be scraped without my consent in order to train a model that is profiting off the backs of so many great artists. This isn&rsquo;t inspiration, this is theft. Because of this, I don&rsquo;t see how the work created from AI models can receive copyright protection. To go one step further, I don&rsquo;t see how it is legal for AI companies like Midjourney (who use unethical practices when it comes to sourcing images) to profit off of these models, or for their customers to profit off of the images created.
