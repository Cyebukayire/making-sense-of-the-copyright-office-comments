AI is a massive copyright threat to all individuals and corporations. It steals visual, audio, and text information from creatives, and reassembles it into something else devoid of meaningful human involvement. I believe AI works should not be protected by copyright laws, and should be heavily regulated by the government. AI also poses a threat to the security and privacy of individuals, using deepfake technology and natural human language to deceive the general public with false narratives. I do not feel comfortable with AI technology being protected or unregulated. It makes me feel unsafe as a citizen, and makes it difficult to believe any information from the internet, including &quot;official&quot; government communications.
