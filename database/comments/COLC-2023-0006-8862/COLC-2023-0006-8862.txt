Ai needs immediate regulation. It is an enromnus breach of copyright law. It is soley built of thousands of visual artists, and writers work. Not to mention the dystopian nightmare of peoples likenesses and their voices being stolen. Its removing entry level jobs in several industries and will only get worse. These ai generation models like midjourney and dallE could be useful if they weren&#39;t trained on stolen work. <br/> All of the AIs must be trained on freely given, royalty free images/text and not the stolen work scrapped from across the internet without the author/artists consent.
