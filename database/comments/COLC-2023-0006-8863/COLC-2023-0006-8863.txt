I am an artist. I post my digital artwork online. Many other artists I follow are extremely worried about AI data scraping, specifically that our works will be used without our consent to create work that replaces our hard earned talent. Art across all mediums is the height of humanity&#39;s communicative ability. AI is only capable of creating kitsch. No art that is majorly generated with AI is worth creating. As such, the creation of images or sounds using AI should not include data scraped from artists, nor should be able to be copyrighted. In the case of the new Indiana Jones film, the de-aging of Harrison Ford was accomplished with images owned by Lucasfilm and over 300 visual artists working for 3 years. In such a case, limited use of AI as a tool is excusable and should remain copyrightable. Deepfakes, midjourney, DALL-E, or AI voice acting Media, etc. Created with copyrighted and scraped data sets cannot be reasonably stopped, but should not be copyrightable based on the lack of human work constituting it. These should also be discouraged as a quick and easy source of revenue for any corporation or entity that wants to avoid paying artists (see the SAG/WGA strikes). The technological aspect eludes me as I&#39;m not a programmer, but the hard work of human artists must be protected, not the copyright of a piece of AI kitsch popped out in half a minute.
