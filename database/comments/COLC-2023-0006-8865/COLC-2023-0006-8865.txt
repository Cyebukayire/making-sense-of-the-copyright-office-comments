I am a freelance visual artist who is facing unprecedented theft of my work and labour; theft that is then being used to replace me. I have lost multiple potential work opportunities where the company who used to work with me instead started using generative AI. For the first time in my entire career of 6 years, I&#39;m concerned that I will no longer be able to work as an artist and support myself. I do not reside in the US, but I know most of peers there feel the same dread and uncertainty, as do thousands and hundreds of thousands of working class creatives. Consent should be at the forefront of any potential regulations- I, the copyright holder, do not consent to my work being used in a commercial model that competes in the same economic market as me. If this basic protection is not in place, then the entire concept of copyright is obsolete. Companies should approach individual copyright owners and license the work legally, as it has always happened in the past. Generative AI models must be transparent about their sources. Generative AI companies should be forced to appropriately compensate artists for their past theft, and all existing models that unethically steal from cultural workers should be algorithmically disgorged.
