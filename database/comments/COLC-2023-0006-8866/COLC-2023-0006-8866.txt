I think that it should be fully impossible to copyright work created by AI. The most important thing about any art, be it drawn, written, spoken, performed, is that it is uniquely human. Copyright is important because it protects the physical and intellectual labor and ingenuity of human beings. AI is not a human. It is an algorithm. It is not in need of labor protections, and what it produces is not unique. It does not create, it recycles what is fed into it. And as many models are trained on the art, writing, and voices of others without their explicit given consent, AI is also theft. To be able to copyright AI art and writing is to invalidate the entire concept and premise of a copyright in the first place.
