As both an artist and a computer programmer, it appalls me that the clear violation of ethics is being so lauded by the tech industry. Sites like Deviantart.com, apps like Discord, and many other major platforms have backed this technology with no regard to the creators who provide content on their platforms. And many have backpedaled after further insight. They&#39;re opting users IN by default. They&#39;re feeding our paywalled content to the algorithms and asking (or never asking) way later after there is no way to undo what they&#39;ve done. It is entirely possible for the AI to completely 100% duplicate someone&#39;s work at some point. AI art is like cutting up a bunch of magazines gluing them together and then calling yourself a photographer. There are many instances of artists having their work stolen and copied and fraud occurring before AI art became available, and it seems this tool was created with the intent of making those scammers and fraudsters jobs easier.
