To Whom It May Concern;<br/><br/>Author, screenwriter, and playwright here. The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence used for the generation of written material based on existing writer&#39;s intellectual property and copyrighted material is incredibly dangerous and, blatantly: thievery. <br/><br/>In the statement above, I used the words &quot;intellectual PROPERTY&quot; and &quot;COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL.&quot; These items create the bedrock of a writer&#39;s livelihood. Full stop. Each person&#39;s career is predicated not only on the writer&#39;s ideas, but more importantly, the order and cadence with which they are strung together. This is precisely the thing that these companies wish to extract from artists and use for free -- they hope. By stealing author&#39;s words and stories to train their LLM&#39;s, the AI companies have a commodity. It is not enough that they have the AI engine alone. It is not enough that they have the copyrighted material alone. Their algorithms DO NOT WORK without source material; they can only be used if they have already learned. Therefore, any material written by them is some derivative work or copy-cat version of an existing artists work.<br/><br/>The AI companies MUST answer to this disregard for copyright. The only way forward is heavy government regulation to protect individuals (artists) from domineering corporations. Forcing compensation to the writers who they have fed into their large language models is not enough, either, when these companies are already boast valuations in the billions. Why? Again: because they do not have a commodity without the preexisting artists&#39; work. A small sliver of a percentage of their future income would not suffice for handing away the rights to &quot;HOW&quot; someone writes. Inevitably this is what they will come for to gain the exclusive right to train their models. They cannot be allowed to do this.<br/><br/>Beyond this, not everyone is meant to be an artist. So, the argument that this is democratizing access to becoming an artist is nonsensical; as this technology does not make anyone an artist, it regurgitates owned material as an aggregate &quot;new&quot; thing. As such, the material it creates was from copyrighted material, therefore, the material it creates cannot and should not be allowed, in part or in full, to exist under the laws of copyright. The RIGHT to have your COPY protected is a human right. All these machines do is steal from human artists who have come before.<br/><br/>And if anyone brings up the Open Domain... that does not mean you may steal without giving credit. Whenever someone adapts  or uses material in the Open Domain, they say &#39;based on ____. By ______&quot;. This machine might as well list every author its ever stolen from.<br/><br/>These models should be forced to purge of everyone&#39;s material who has not opted in (literally everyone), and then we&#39;ll see how it works. Furthermore, a strict, specific transparency from what these models learn from must be enforced. Currently, I see small publications that must download a program that STOPS the active scraping by LLMs; it should be the reverse, they should not be allowed to scrape material unless they have express permission that can be revoked at any time.<br/><br/>This thing is already out of control, the time to move on it is NOW!<br/><br/>Thank you!
