AI technology is very powerful and has the potential to make a lot of work easier. The issue I have is when it comes to art generators, it&#39;s very clear that they are using stolen artwork that was taken without consent from  thousands of artists. That is the main thing that needs to be regulated, otherwise everything generated with it is the result of non-consenting artists. Another solution is for the AI companies to pay royalties to every artist in their training data every time an image references their work.
