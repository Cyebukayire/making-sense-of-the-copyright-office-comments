Generative AI is unequivocally IP theft. These &quot;AI image generators&quot; have built their datasets from millions upon millions of pieces of work used without permission from their creators. The entire practice is based upon exploitation and at such a massive scale an individual would never stand a chance to get their grievances addressed. Which is why the government must step in and REGULATE generative AI so artists and other creators are not robbed of their future while some Silicon Valley venture capitalists get rich off of stolen data. Furthermore the government should force any company or individuals to delete their datasets made from these stolen goods like any other assets forfeited in a criminal enterprise. If they want to rebuild afterwards they can do so legitimately by compensating creators like any other business. Otherwise the courts are going to be clogged for decades with class action lawsuits and small creators struggling to undo the damages they&#39;ve incurred. As I&#39;m sure the Copyright office is well aware it&#39;s already legal precedent that only a human being can have copyright and none of these generative AI programs have or will ever have any right to the content within or generated by their datasets. Do not allow this farce to continue and regulate generative AI. The future of art and human expression depends on it.
