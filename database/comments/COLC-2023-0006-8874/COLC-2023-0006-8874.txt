Good Afternoon,<br/><br/>I believe that there are a few solid reasons to disavow and otherwise legislate against generative AI. My reasons are listed below.<br/><br/>There is an incredible risk to generative AI systems. They have a great potential to mass-produce dangerous misinformation, especially the formation of fake news backed up by realistic-looking generated images of riots and events.<br/><br/>Generative AI poses a direct threat to thousands of artists in the economy, and it will do more than merely &#39;restructure&#39; the economy. The economy will not have new jobs in the form of prompt users, but instead will have a great abundance of unemployed artists and workers with no new means to income. Users who wish to have an image will not employ a prompt user, they will simply generate the image on their own.<br/><br/>In conclusion, generative AI is in serious need of regulation to avoid the very real risk of panic-inducing and of mutilating thousands of self-employed artists&#39; jobs. These dangers are best addressed in regulation, especially in the form of outlawing the training of generative AI on copyrighted images.<br/><br/>With Respect,<br/>Eugene Rehfeldt<br/>phone number: 850-339-8737<br/>E-mail: rehfeuge@gmail.com&nbsp;<br/>
