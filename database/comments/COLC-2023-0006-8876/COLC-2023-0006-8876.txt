As an Audio Engineer, Producer and DJ, I appreciate the Copyright Office&#39;s Notice of Inquiry on generative artificial intelligence and copyright, and I urge the office to incorporate the perspective of artists, songwriters, producers and other individual creative workers. The work you are undertaking will influence generations of creators, and safeguarding human creativity must remain the foundation of any future rule or regulation. <br/> <br/>Generative AI so far has been exciting to see expand and the creative possibilities are endless. However generative AI should not be left unchecked to displace or eliminate human creativity. The Copyright Office must protect us creators. <br/> <br/>As you look to develop new rules and regulations governing generative AI, please focus on the widespread misuse and theft of copyrighted works to train AI models and systems. Music makers such as myself, will be powerless in preventing copyrighted creations from being ingested without consent or compensation.   <br/> <br/>I also urge you to reinforce the principles of copyright law that are designed to incentivize human creativity and help ensure that outputs from generative AI models do not infringe on existing copyrighted materials. No human should have to compete against a technology infringing their own work to displace them from the market. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to listen, I hope you will consider our concerns regarding the future of AI and the rules you help put in place.<br/><br/>- Omar Morsy
