I believe that AI is a very big copyright concern, as it uses huge amounts of copyrighted data without getting the required permissions to do so. It has been proven many times that the works of prolific artists and photographers were used to train image generation software. It is concerning that artists need to fall back in softwares such as Glaze or Nightshade to protect their works from being used without their permission. Companies should be held accountable for their unlawful practices.
