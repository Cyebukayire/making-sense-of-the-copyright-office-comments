The current structure of AI Learning is built off of stolen work collected without anyone&#39;s consent for the sole purpose of profit without compensation. The one thing that separates us from everything else we know in this universe is art. Whether it&#39;s a drawing, painting, a design, a piece of music, or whatever creation you&#39;d like all of it comes from the human spirit. Granting copyright protection to AI is a dangerous road that would all but eliminate hundreds and thousands of jobs but more importantly dilute the work of actual humans that create for the world we live in.<br/><br/>1) AI art steals and manipulates already created art without any compensation. It doesn&#39;t create and without the hundreds and thousands of images that were stolen and used without permission, it doesn&#39;t even work.<br/>2) Offering copyright to AI would over-saturate the market. Simply put humans can&#39;t keep up with the machines it&#39;s not possible, and many entry-level jobs would be lost in an effort for big corporations to save money. It would also dilute brand identity because most AI looks incredibly similar creating difficulty for companies to stand out and create a never-ending war to race to the bottom.<br/><br/>3) The already flood of images is diluting many sites that used to host art. If allowed into the market this would be even more disastrous for everyone involved. Eventually leading to many markets collapsing from this oversaturation of medium. It would be like the Comics boom in the 90s but cranked up to 11.<br/><br/>4) The balance between labor and the employers would shift the power where human creators would lose bargaining power, labor rights, and lack of harboring new talents in their industries. Creating a barren landscape that once flourished.<br/><br/>For the sake of the industry and for creatives everywhere it would be a catastrophic mistake to allow AI Images to be copyrighted. Not only for human creativity but also economically it would be a massive fallout and put many industries in financial ruin.<br/><br/>Link to an academic paper &quot;AI Art and its Impact on Artists&quot;<br/>https://magazine.lmu.edu/articles/mimic-master/<br/>
