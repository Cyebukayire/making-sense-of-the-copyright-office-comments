I don&#39;t believe A.I. generated content falls under copywrite law as it is content generated by something other than a human. Humans can advocate for themselves in a court of law to resolve disputes. Humans can seek redress when their content is infringed upon. A.I. generators cannot do so. The content they create is drawn from outside sources, from real people and data, but A.I. cannot claim originality, cannot claim domain over its content. A.I. content cannot be protected under copywrite law because it was not generated by adherents of copywrite law.
