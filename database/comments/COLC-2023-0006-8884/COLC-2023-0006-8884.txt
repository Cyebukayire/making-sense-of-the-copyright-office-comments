I am an individual artist who does not see technology as a threat, however, I view the dirty and unethical practices of gobbling up data without artists&#39; permission to train AI models as the lowest form of labor exploitation. It is crucial that current laws support human artists, given that these tools will soon be able to outperform human artists in all commercial production pipelines. We, the artists and the creative force behind societies need to remain competitive against massive corporations and data exploiters.<br/><br/>Generative AI is presented as a way to free artists from the legwork, but artists have never complained about the inherent part of creating art and producing creative works. Machines should never gain the ability to claim legal ownership of algorithmic or automated outputs. It is evident that such unethical rights will render all human artists obsolete, and our society&#39;s creative output will be controlled by always exploitative AI entities. The generative AI will never be as creative as the human artists. What is happening is that the companies are leeching on human labor to train their models and presenting the results as something fully AI generated content which is just a mind trick and illusion.<br/><br/>This is not progress, dirty labor exploitation is repacked as progress. Human history is the history of human creativity and human arts. You will remove the humans from the remaining history of our universe if you decide to permit copyright for robots and machines.<br/><br/>No copyright for machine output. These models can&#39;t create any output without using stolen prior art.<br/><br/>Thanks
