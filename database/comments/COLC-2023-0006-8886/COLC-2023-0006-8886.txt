As an artist myself protections against AI models are very important and should be enforced. AI uses stolen hard work of many artists and slaps them together in a horrid abomination un credited and tends to be done without acknowledgment of the original artists trying to make a living posting art online. Which is why tools such as Glaze and nightshade have been essential to protecting artists rights and work from being taken advantage of and placed into the meat mill garbage of AI pieces. It should also be stated AI has been used to cheat art competitions to which actual talented artists could use that money, as well as steal the works of the deceased artists who are also not able to protect themselves, if this were to happen in the music industry and produce a new Beatles song without the Beatles their lawyers would shut it down immediately which is why previously AI generated imagery was compared to Napster accurately for stealing works from actual artists. In short we need just as much protection to be safe and create without fear of our work being stolen.
