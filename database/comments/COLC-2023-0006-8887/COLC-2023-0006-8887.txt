 Ai &ldquo;artists&rdquo; love to claim that Ai software learns just like humans do. If that&rsquo;s the case, why is it that when one  small change, or error, enters the process, they&rsquo;re unable to replicate the same results? Meanwhile, a trained artist will always be able to produce those results, whether they are at a computer or holding a piece of paper and pencil. Let&rsquo;s not joke around anymore. We all know, it&rsquo;s not even remotely the same thing. Without the data stolen from thousands of artists, software like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney would not exist. Just because you ordered food at a restaurant, doesn&rsquo;t make you a chef. <br/><br/>If Ai &ldquo;artists&rdquo; are so proud of their product, why do most of them omitt the fact they used Ai to create the art, when selling it? It&rsquo;s because everyone, including themselves, knows it&rsquo;s less valuable. These are products built, foremost on lies, with the goal of destroying the livelihoods and copyrights of real artists. If AI &ldquo;artists&rdquo; are so confident in their product, why are they so opposed to the idea of human artists putting protective measures on their own work, like &ldquo;Nightshade&rdquo;, which will poison the data set, IF trained upon without permission? These entitled thieves, can&rsquo;t stand the idea, of artists protecting their own work. They are furious at the thought, of not being able to scrape data from anyone they wish.<br/><br/> Every day, people take for granted how artists and designers impact their lives. If the music industry is able to protect their artists, let&rsquo;s protect visual artists as well.
