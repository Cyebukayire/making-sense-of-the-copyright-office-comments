In the short time since the advent of AI art, chat, and similar technologies, we&#39;ve seen only a small glimpse of what lies ahead of us.  If we condemn these marvels in their infancy, we&#39;ve accepted the status quo as our path forward.  Rather than more of the same, we should embrace this new aspect of human potential where a single person can achieve in a short time what previously took many by simply having an idea and some know how.  It&#39;s the story of automation on a scale seldom seen in human history, and this will empower individuals and small groups in a ways we can scarcely even imagine.  We&#39;ve entered a new age of ideas.  Let&#39;s make the power of AI accessible to everyone and watch the wonders that unfold.  If these technologies are restricted, neutered, and policed to the point where only a privileged few can use them effectively, we will have destroyed an unimaginable world of possibilities.
