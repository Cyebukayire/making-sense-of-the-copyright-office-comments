Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning has become one of the fastest, growing threats for many industries, despite their lack in quality, many in positions of power don&#39;t care enough, overlooking such imperfections, and using it as an excuse to fire employees just to save themselves some money. This threat however is also threatening countries and workers outside the USA, as we have seen already with the Translation industry that got overtaken by imperfect machine translations (and it isn&#39;t rare to find instructions in our products that lack the necesary grammar to be understandable).<br/>Not only that, due to the way it works it&#39;s also the biggest break in copyright by stealing from anyone regadless of their size. The USA should have a responsability in this, regulating how they access their data and how it&#39;s going to be used, not only for the work of independent/freelance workers but also from enterprises (regardless of their size). Specially when it&#39;s not only works of human expression (art, writing, voice, songs, music, videos, images, etc.) but also private information.
