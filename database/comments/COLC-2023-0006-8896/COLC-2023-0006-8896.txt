I&rsquo;m a professional video game designer, art director, and studio founder who has been working in games for 14 years. I&rsquo;ve always loved the intersection of art and technology, and I love coming up with new technical approaches in the games I work on, but I have deep concerns about generative AI models with regard to copyright.<br/><br/>I have spent my whole life developing as an artist, first as a child with crayons and markers, and later with digital painting tools and 3D software. All the while I have posted work online to both promote myself and also to share and develop community with other artists. After hearing about haveibeentrained.com, a website for checking if your work has been used in AI training datasets, I used it to check some samples of my work and found that lots of it has been used in AI training data. It bothers me deeply that this work has been collected by tech companies without my permission and fed into AI software which breaks down and memorizes my artistic choices (and those of every other artist in my industry). And now these AI models are being sold as a replacement for the same human artists whose work they are built on.<br/><br/>As a video game developer I work in tech, and I understand that technology will always be changing, but if we want to have healthy and competitive industries we need to maintain protections of the rights of creators and copyright holders, as we have done through previous technological revolutions like the printing press or recorded music. Creators and copyright holders should be free to license their work for use in AI models, or train their own models, but the choice must be theirs. Otherwise what would be the motivation to develop a new artwork if someone else can immediately feed it into their AI model and make derivative works that undercut you?<br/><br/>I believe AI models should be able to train models using work that is not under copyright -- this will still enable them to have a vast trove of public domain training material to work with that does not infringe on current living creators and copyright holders. It&rsquo;s also important that any AI models that use copyrighted work for noncommercial/research purposes should not be allowed to be commercialized. This seems like a backdoor around &ldquo;fair use&rdquo;.<br/><br/>On the copyrightability of AI outputs:<br/>Material or artwork that is generated by AI should not be protected by copyright, because writing a prompt to describe a picture is very different from the actual picture itself. The majority of decisions that led to the work were not made by any human. They were made by software -- or in another sense, they are a sampling and recombining of the decisions made by all the creators of the original work that was used as training data.<br/>Additionally, if AI material is allowed to be copyrightable, there will be many unforeseen consequences. E.g. it&rsquo;s not hard to conceive of a new type of &ldquo;copyright troll&rdquo; who uses AI to generate a constant stream of output for purpose of staking out copyright over a field. Imagine you make a comic book about an original cartoon dog, and then you get sued by some blog that has been using AI to post ten thousand cartoon dogs per day just so it could corner the market on copyrights of cartoon dogs?<br/><br/>Opt in vs opt out:<br/>Granting permission must be on an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; basis. &ldquo;Opting out&rdquo; of training models is a false solution considering how the internet works -- much of my work has been duplicated all over the internet in multiple countries and there&rsquo;s no way for me to track down every social media post, video or article that has ever contained my work. There&rsquo;s also no way for me to know which  AI models have scraped which pieces of my work, and with the ongoing growth in the number of models, having every artist flag every single artwork in every single model on an ongoing basis is completely impossible.The only solution is &ldquo;opt in&rdquo;.<br/><br/>I know this is a very complex issue, but the rights of human creators must be protected.
