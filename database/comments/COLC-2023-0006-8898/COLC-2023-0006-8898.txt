Generative AI has the power to end creative jobs, by purely outcompeting original artists financially while also feeding of their work. To be a working artist and to protect your work is already incredibly hard. Many artists struggled to get fair wages even before AI. Competing against a machine that only asks for a cheap subscription will not be possible for any human to compete against even when the result is only good enough. The value and quality of generative AI outputs is completely dependent on the sources that were taken without consent. The prompts instructions I have seen for incredible results are shockingly basic and can be compared to a starting brief that comes from a client. As an artist I know that these prompts can be executed in endless different ways and that the thousand of choices we make during creation make the final piece. Therefore I don&rsquo;t see any authorship of the result for the prompter. <br/>Granting ai output s copyright would be technically and morally wrong. It can have a very bad impact: If art is no longer a viable job only very few and/privileged people can be a professional artist. We will loose divers voices and perspectives in the name of profit. While less and less artists keep creating and sharing, the models will decline in quality when there is no new art to ingest. That and the stagnation in art (since the algorithm can only generate what it knows but not invent) is why I believe generative AI is not the future of art. But it can destroy it for the next decade(s). <br/><br/>I very hope these concerns are heard.<br/><br/>Best regards, <br/><br/>Natalie Dombois
