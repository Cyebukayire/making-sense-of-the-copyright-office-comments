Any LLM or any AI generated and trained models created due to massive amounts of human by products and/or creations, like art or music, should not have any copyright protections. The technology puts ownership of all creation publish on the web in the hands of a few, those with the most money, and is antithetical to what copyright protection means. Those protections should only be reserved for human created works. Humans / the general population should have the utmost protections when it comes to their created works, not AI, LLM&#39;s, or corporations looking to expand their already vast wealth with technology solely aimed at removing people from the equation.
