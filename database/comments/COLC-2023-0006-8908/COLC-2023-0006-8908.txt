Being a professional musician for most of my life, I see the potential of Artificial Intelligence as we know it even at this moment as immediate danger to creative people, as it tends to emulate and replace us as creators, and also steal our ideas and use them without having to pay the actual creators. Which would lead to improper use of our work and talent and in diminishing our capability to make a living. I see arts and music as vitally important to our society, and we depend on you to create and implicate laws to protect us! Thank you for your time.
