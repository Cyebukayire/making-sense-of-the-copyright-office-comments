I&#39;m a 35 year veteran of professional songwriting. Even though I&#39;m an older member of the Nashville writing community, I would be the first to acknowledge AI is here to stay. And I know it undeniably has potential to do good. But I also think in some ways, it&#39;s like a gun- In the wrong hands, with no parameters in place for its use, it could do irreparable damage to one of the last true American art forms. Please remember this as we go along this new road and please, don&#39;t be afraid to endorse ways to insure its future, not only for songwriters, but for the very future of this most human of art forms.<br/><br/>Thank you!
