Hello,<br/><br/>I am a computer scientist at a large tech company. I am also an artist. I&#39;ve seen first-hand how AI impacts currently working artists (especially digital illustrators) as a result of technology that is being designed and created rapidly. I ask for the following things, based on what I have seen in the artist communities I am a part of:<br/><br/>- AI technology needs to be trained on content that was gathered with consent. The fact that consent is ignored is a direct factor in how artists losing their jobs, by unwillingly helping create a direct competitor to their work (which would not be able to output quality content with artist&#39;s work as training input).<br/><br/>- Output created or modified by AI technology needs to be flagged as such, with a least a brief description of the extent to which AI modified the original input. This is needed to ensure that consumers can make informed choices and interpretations about the media they see. We already see the negative impacts of not knowing what was created with AI in various spaces (e.g., media regarding the current conflict between Israel/Gaza is being regarded as suspicious because veracity is now hard to verify; students and artists are being accused of using AI for their work by teachers and customers due to use of naive AI-detection software). AI content cannot be allowed to be used widely in the world without a plan or method for being able to verify its origin.<br/><br/>I do believe that technology and art can exist hand-in-hand (and these two domains have done so over the long history of art to create wonderful new things). With the thoughtfully regulated AI technology, we can protect artist&#39;s livelihoods, ensure the safety and truth of media content,, and enjoy the benefit of AI where it counts.<br/><br/>Thank you.
