For copyright to have any meaning, people, institutions, and businesses must respect it. The creators of the AI datasets did not. They scraped materials from the Internet they had no right to use, claimed they did so for research purposes, agreed that they would not make money off them, and then sold access. Every part of every image spit out by generators was originally created by a human, who goes unrecognized (unless they are popular enough that their name is a style prompt) and uncompensated. If AI companies are allowed to continue to do so, with no checks or balances, any entity with enough money and resources will steal art, writing, code, etc., and use it without crediting or compensating the original creator. Copyright will effectively be dead.<br/><br/>AI companies built their datasets on lies, have sold access to those sets because they lied about why they created them, and support promoters who claim their content is original when it&#39;s stolen from someone else. Everything about this explosion of AI-generated content is based upon a lie, and that foundation will crumble. It&#39;s already taking a toll; short story magazines like Clarksworld have to shut down submissions because of the influx of junk texts cobbled together. Book cover contests are ending because individuals using AI refused to admit their work is AI. Artists are finding that engagement with, and selling of, their work is tanking because people who want to support human creatives, but who aren&#39;t familiar enough with AI to know when they&#39;re looking at a fake image, are just not engaging/buying.<br/><br/>I&#39;m a writer and an artist, and I know, if I put anything up that can be accessed from the Internet, it&#39;s going to go into one of these datasets without my permission. Because the algorithms can return my work to anyone with the right &#39;prompt&#39;, I will spend time convincing others to take a chance on my original efforts because no, they&#39;re not AI-generated. I&#39;m a real human, and my words and images are legitimately my own. I don&#39;t believe I should have to share my copyright with someone else who puts a few words in a prompt box, generates duplicates of my work with slight modifications, and then wants to copyright it. They have done nothing to create what is generated other than nudge a computer algorithm.<br/><br/>Copyright should be for human endeavors, not a reward for using a computer algorithm.
