Any text, art, code, or other content generated by artificial means should not be able to be protected under copyright law because they are not created by a human. These types of works inherently function by copying, digesting, and regurgitating content created by others with no credit or compensation afforded to those parties. Because of the opacity of these models, impacted parties have little to no recourse, and are left with no option but to try and reverse engineer training sets to even see if their property is included in them.<br/><br/>Moreover, the act of training an AI system on content owned by others without explicit, verifiable, opt-in consent should be seen as a violation of the ownership rights of the authors /legal owners of that content. All current models that have been trained on hidden datasets should be declared in violation of copyright unless they publish verifiable proof of the content contained in the training models.
