AI is exclusively stealing work created by people like me, without my (our) permission. If their software has stolen comments, pictures, any part of my blog, any videos I created, I should be allowed to deny the use forever. Art only exists when humans do it. It is easy to regulate this mass theft, as long as it is done swiftly. Even big entertainment studios are finding out how they can protect their copywritten material from this Silicone Valley theft. To constantly let tech bros do anything they want and to then lie and claim it is progress is outrageous. AI was absolutely created to destroy jobs. That is its only purpose. Uncreative people finding ways to steal anything they can from creative people. Wealthy people stealing from unwealthy. <br/><br/>It is a fallacy to believe AI has to be accepted. &quot;The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, and our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of&hellip;. It is they who pull the wires that control the public mind.&quot; - Edward Bernays.  <br/>
