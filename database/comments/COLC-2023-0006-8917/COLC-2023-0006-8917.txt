My views on each of the three issues that are brought up here:<br/><br/>1. For-profit AI tools should be required to pay to train off of copyrighted work, and in my opinion it&rsquo;s absurd to suggest otherwise. We require special licenses for lots of different kinds of consumption of copyrighted material, and limiting use in AI applications (without at least specific authorization) is the best way to protect the value of human-generated content.<br/><br/>2. AI-generated works that do not have substantial added value through the work of a conscious human should not be copyrightable. The entire purpose of copyright is to incentivize people to develop new art and allow them to have control over their own works. Given that AI results in negligible barriers to new content and is not a person that can have concern for control of its works neither of these are compelling reasons to extend copyright protection to AI-generated works.<br/><br/>Copyright liability for AI should be assigned to the lowest-level for-profit developer of the model outputs. In cases of open-source models, this would be the user of the model; in cases where models are developed for-profit, liability should be on the basis of model input licensing and be assigned to the model developer, though the developer should be able to assign such liability to users as part of an agreement for use of the software.
