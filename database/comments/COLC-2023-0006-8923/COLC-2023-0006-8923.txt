AI is a thecnology that steal us from our voices, our work and our rights! A program that is based primarily on the theft of Images and data, can&#39;t have right to intelectual property and Copyright. <br/>By giving it access to these rights would send the message that theft is something that could be ignored by the law! <br/>These programs should have transparency on the data they ingest, should give compensation and allow users to opt-in!
