As a college student, I am witnessing the overwhelming misuse of AI in all classes especially those where students are expected to conduct original research and submit reports. At least half of the class in English uses AI to write their homework assignments. I worry that normalizing plagiarism via wide spread of AI and intellectual deficiency as result from the use of AI will be the downfall of this nation.
