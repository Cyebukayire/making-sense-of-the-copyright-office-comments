There is no &quot;ai art&quot; without the tech companies that make them scraping and stealing art from physical artists to use in their code. Hardly any, if not then none, of the artists who&#39;s artworks were used to train the code were credited, asked for permission to use their art, or compensated. In fact, many ai makers have stated they purposely didn&#39;t ask because they were aware the artists would not give their permission to use their art. Ai art makers have even gone as far as to feed the art of deceased artists to their machines in order to capitalize on the fact that the original artist cannot make any new pieces nor can they protest to their art being used.Not to mention ai art only has the ability to photobash and create kind of different but extremely similar &quot;art&quot; to per-existing artist pieces. This has led to a lot of problems. Ai art has even been found to steal artists signatures due to the sheer number of certain artists artwork being fed to the code.<br/><br/> not only that but ai art has been used to try to push physical artists out of their job fields. people have started feeding their favorite artists work into ai solely for the purpose of having the ai create a copy of the artists style without having to go through and pay the artist. Also, many ai art coders have reveled in the fact that their tech could &quot;make artists obsolete&quot;. Many have stated so on their twitters when faces with backlash from artists angry that their art was stolen.
