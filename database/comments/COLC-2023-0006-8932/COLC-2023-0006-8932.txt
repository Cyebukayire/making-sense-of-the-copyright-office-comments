NO CONSENT. GenAI was created without consent of the artists, writers, and other creators that it stole from to create its datasets. Without the work of millions of creators, GenAI could not exist. We need CONSENT and FAIR PAY. <br/><br/>We are all humans. Our work is created from our unique perspectives of our interests, relationships, joys, and even traumas. How dare GenAI steal our work and even try to profit from it. It steals our humanity and allows big corporations to profit without paying a dime to the artists they stole from. <br/><br/>Imagine your life&rsquo;s work taken and fed into a machine you didn&rsquo;t consent. Then thousands of images show up in your creative style. How chilling is that? How chilling is that for a child that started drawing at 7. How chilling is that for a veteran who spent decades managing their money and time so they could create art. <br/><br/>I ask you that you create regulations not just for now, but the future. Act in the favor of those who have lost their jobs to NONCONSENSUAL scrapping and whose opportunities are dwindling. Act in favor of your constituents and not tech corporations.
