AI generated images should be regulated in order to protect the creators whose underlying work is being consumed in the training and refinement processes that these generators use. Use of tools like Glaze and Nightshade by artists in order to poison their work and make it unusable by AI generators should be encouraged and federally protected. Additionally, images generated by AI should not be subject to copyright, as the work to generate the image is not done by a human being in any capacity. The resulting image is no more or less created by the would-be copyright-pursuer than any collection of random noise might constitute a sound. It&#39;s akin to the old adage that if you give a million monkeys enough time and typewriters, they&#39;ll eventually hang out the works of Shakespeare, but to expand upon it, what are all of the imperfect products that those monkeys produce, but flawed would-be replicas of a real human being&#39;s work and intentions?
