AI is already becoming the monster people predicted it would. Companies across the world have laid off artists in favor of soulless generated images. Individuals interested in technology are riding the wave eager for a future where creativity and the human spirit are eclipsed by nothingness. The existence of those voices are evidence that a sizeable group of our population believes art is useless, and machines should control a technocracy led by fools. Intelligent people who have taken it upon themselves to learn the value of being human and the expression it entails, found that the spirit can be channeled through the machine. But those who channel the spirit through an medium are being choked out of their fields in the same way an invasive species outcompetes the native species. The fools who value profit over beauty cannot have their way. They cannot have protection of law to sap the life out of everything they touch. If the usage of AI cannot be controlled in the hands of the responsible, it should be destroyed.
