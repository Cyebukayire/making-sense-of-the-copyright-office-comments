I already commented previous time you have asked, this time I will be shorter. As an artist I found my images in databases AI companies use for generating images. They charge for these services and make billions, putting us out of jobs. I never consented to this, I was neither asked nor compensated for this. None of my fellow artist had. I feel violated and exploited. Giving copyright to images generated by pixel placement prediction algorithm is unjust and has no logic to it. On a technical level, it lacks any kind of human authorship as they can be created while the screen is turned off or by someone giving prompt instructions over the phone and letting third part decide which of the options algorithm creates is ok.
