If generative AI can reproduce &#39;it,&#39; then it means &#39;it&#39; was never novel, original, nor not-obvious enough to be protected.<br/>I don&#39;t even think there&#39;s anything the USPTO can do to stop the commons from being empowered by genAI. It came out swinging. The first thing a student sees when he logs into Github is an ad for github copilot so it can code for them. The same for Google Collab in Jupyter Notebooks and Amazon Codewhisperer. In Word and other office products like PP, google suite, etc? There is a duet or copilot AI that reminds the student they can use AI to write. Just using Windows at all? Copilot replaced Cortana. These tools have been forced into use by companies like Microsoft who are purposefully damaging the eduction sector by sabotaging students from completing their studies without AI.
