Lately i&#39;ve been more active on social media and Youtube due to the recent Israel-Palestine conflict and just to look up educational material regarding various scientific topics. I can safely say that the effects of artificial Intelligence generated content are much much more destructive than one would think, many times in unexpected ways. The very same AI image generators that i strongly think should not have any place in the realm of Human artistry nor receive any copyright protection, heavily pollute material intended for educational and information gathering purposes too. When i say this i mean the following: News, Youtube videos, articles, scientific publications, advertisments etc etc...the list is way longer and it is very alarming. People think the images they see and the text they read is real and this seeped insidiously into these domains almost undetected by the unsuspecting people. Separating what is usable information and what is not takes more and more time. Disinformation is rampant and much more easier to fabricate now because of these programs in virtually every walk of life and it is glaringly obvious that the very same programs trying to displace people in Art related jobs also cause many more problems on a global scale.
