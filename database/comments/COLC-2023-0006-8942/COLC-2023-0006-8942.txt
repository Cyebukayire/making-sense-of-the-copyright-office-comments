I work as a designer/animator and I am very interested and concerned with the explosion of AI and the issues surrounding copyright and training data. I am sure that both professional and personal work of mine has been used to train models without my consent, credit or any form of compensation.<br/>I have been working for years to be able to create work. A company being able to use my work to train a model and release work that I then have to compete against should be illegal. Artists, writers, actors, and other creatives would have all locked off our work and shared much less of ourselves if we had known this would happen. AI seems to have popped up overnight, and there was no way to protect ourselves. <br/>Big tech AI companies are moving as fast as possible to normalize the mass appropriation of craft and labor. My livelihood is being stolen and weaponized against my future career. Copyright does nothing to protect against this exploitation. I don&#39;t have issues with other artists viewing and being inspired by my work because they are human. They are not a large algorithm owned by companies like StabilityAI, Midjourney, OpenAI, reducing my work to data to create a product to compete against and eliminate the scarcity of my hard-earned skill. These companies are trying to monetize my labor with no consent, credit, and compensation. Any opt-out processes exclude models that are already released. The model use needs to be stopped and all models being trained going<br/>forward need to be opt-in. There is no other way to develop an AI model ethically. The USCO made the right decision by denying copyright to AI outputs with no human authorship. It frightens me to think of what would happen if AI outputs could receive copyright, and the copyright farming that would<br/>be sure to follow. I ask that the USCO do everything within its power to end this plagiarism and further protect creators&rsquo; rights against generative AI.
