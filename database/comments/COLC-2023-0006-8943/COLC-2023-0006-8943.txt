I am concerned that AI can be easily deployed to smear, lie, sell and exploit people&rsquo;s images and work. Utilized for propaganda is also a huge concern. While I see the amazing accomplishments of AI and its potential for humanitarian contributions, I know it&rsquo;s in our nature to used it for greed and sketchy reasons. Trust in the Tech Industry is the issue, as history shows.
