AI has a lot of potential world changing value. My issue is that AI&rsquo;s ability to both self learn and use other people&rsquo;s creations   (e.g. books, photos, video, art) is a recipe for disaster. <br/><br/>I strongly urge believe that there must be open and transparent oversight of AI research and use. Just like once the atomic genie got let out of the bottle, AI, left unregulated, has the potential to pose as big a threat.
