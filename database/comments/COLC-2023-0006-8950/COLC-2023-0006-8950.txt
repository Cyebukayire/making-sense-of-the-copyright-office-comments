Hello, I&#39;m writing to comment on the issue of AI and copyright law. I currently work in Film as a set decoration buyer for companies such as Disney/ABC, HBO, and NBC. Part of the scope of my job is working to find art and licenses it for use in TV and film. So although I&#39;m not a legal expert I do speak with a lot of artist about contracts for their work. Recently many of the artist that I work for have started reporting that they are finding copies of their art replicated by AI without their knowledge or consent. Many are having to &quot;opt out&quot; of not having their work copied or are simply finding replicas of their art sold on Amazon. This is clearly intellectual property theft as their consent hasn&#39;t been gained and the companies are profiting off the work of others. <br/>In addition to this, the Actors of Hollywood and the Writers of Hollywood are currently battling to maintain the rights to their likeness and their written work. It is horrifying to think that an actor could be scanned and have his face or voice used in perpetuity without his consent. The ability to control a person&#39;s voice and face without consent is, quite frankly, an abuse of power and an infringement on the basic rights of the American People. I&#39;m very concerned that the AI companies working on scanning art and faces at best don&#39;t understand that an image online isn&#39;t free use and at worst are simply trying to steel the work and the liknesses of other people. I look forward to seeing how this will be regulated in the future in order to protect working Americans. I&#39;ve included two images taken from posts by artist I work with to illustrate my points.
