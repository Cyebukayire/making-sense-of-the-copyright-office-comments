Artificial Intelligence I feel should not have a place under commercial environments; most of the elements involving learning typically involve inputting information/images to where the original creator did not consent to their works to be replicated for no compensation or posthumous creators that cannot provide input to where artificial intelligence would stand to benefit off the works of another that cannot retaliate or refute.On an economic point, I personally feel that those involved in the impacted fields, writers or artist come to mind, are likely to be replaced and eventually be rendered obsolete to companies that would most likely lean to artificial intelligence if it means cutting costs. Which in turn eventually can lead to the market being flooded with artificial intelligence and becoming unsustainable for the creative fields.On top of that the creatives that were hypothetically lead out of the field are likely to be put out of a job they are likely well trained in and cannot simulate the economy effectively as they could. My opinion stands that artificial intelligence should not be used for commercial gain that involves some kind of monetary profit.
