I am no policy expert, nor do I have deep knowledge of copyright law, but it would seem to me that the goal of copyright is ultimately to &quot;promote . . . the useful Arts.&quot; Granting generative AI equal standing with the works of human artists violates that goal. However, that does not mean that AI has no place. I think ethically trained generative AI (that is, models trained on properly licensed materials) could be a useful tool for disabled or underfunded artists. But care must be taken. These AIs are not the same as a tool. I am a writer. Applications like Microsoft Word are tools; AI is more akin to a ghostwriter. A machine cannot be treated as equal with a human writer, but the role it plays is similar. In an ordinary written work, the writer makes every decision. Every word is written for a reason, unconscious or otherwise. With a ghostwriter (or AI), the author lacks this granular control. The ghostwriter takes on many of the micro decisions, leaving the macro direction to the author. Thus the work is partially creditable to both persons. But an algorithm cannot be credited for a creative work.
