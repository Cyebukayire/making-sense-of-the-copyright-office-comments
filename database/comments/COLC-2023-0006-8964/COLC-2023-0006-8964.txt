I am an AI ethicist and have worked in the field for three years. While I love AI and believe it has amazing potential to transform the world, I am concerned by the way data is collected. In particular I find it deeply problematic to collect art from individuals without their explicit consent. This practice could set a dangerous precedent for how we treat each other and our work.
