Hello. I&#39;m Khoiruunisa RamadaFitri, a Freelance Illustrator from Indonesia.<br/><br/>Let&#39;s get to the point.<br/><br/>My experience with generative AI has been generally bad. Personally, my life is already difficult without the disturbance of generative AI.<br/>I don&#39;t see any benefit of it, I think it&#39;s better to leave AI just the way we used it before, non-generative AI that only has very limited intelligence. For example, the ones that integrated in a drawing/design software like Clip Studio Paint, Photoshop, etc. <br/><br/>I think the risks of generative AI are clear even now: generative AI robbed job opportunities from artists/designers like me. <br/>Generative AI encourages plagiarism, which is a forbidden act in the creative industry.<br/>It&#39;s worsened by non-artists/non-designers/consumers&#39; attitude that doesn&#39;t care where the arts came from and just wants things to be quick and cheap. So the existence of generative AI is more of a parasite in life than any help at all.<br/><br/>There is a serious problem within our industry, which is a creative industry in the involvement of generative AI.<br/>AI &quot;works&quot; submitted like a plague in various art sites/freelancing sites trying to compete with human artists&#39; works, which is really problematic and unoriginal. We urgently need to separate between AI-exclusive contests and human-exclusive contests. They aren&#39;t the same and can&#39;t be compared with each other because of differences in efforts and resources.<br/>Please kindly check the file attachment for the sample of the website with AI problem. The sample shows how human artists are uncomfortable with other people who submit AI-generated pictures there and the other pictures show a sample of the AI-generated pictures among submissions. There are also some sample comments regarding generative AI in social media (I hide any identifiable information for privacy purposes, thank you for understanding).<br/><br/>A law requires AI-generated material to be labelled and publicly identified as being generated by AI.<br/>There should be a consistency in statutory or regulatory approaches. As I stated before, there should be a separation between the two categories (AI-generated and human-generated works), where generative AI shouldn&#39;t permitted in any human workfields/contests/etc.<br/><br/>There&#39;s no guarantee that the people who use generative AI would never abuse the materials, so the safest way to it is for the people who train AI models should prepare the material they use to train AI models themselves and shouldn&#39;t use any copyright-protected training materials, or even non-copyright-protected materials (e.g fan arts). <br/>The term &quot;prepare&quot; in this context is creating works themselves to be used for AI model training, not borrowing or using other&#39;s works without the consent of the original creator.<br/>Humans using generative AI should be considered the &quot;author&quot; of material produced by the system ONLY when they produce themselves the materials, not just because they are using the generative AI tools.<br/><br/>Creating something needs a long time dedication and endeavour, so I think this method would be effective in teaching people who use the help of generative AI to understand our efforts and avoid abuse. <br/>So far, generative AI only seems to be used by people mostly for cheating the system. If anything produced by generative AI is later adapted for commercial use, that will be a disaster. It should even be a crime even, because basically it&#39;s a scam where people use other&#39;s works as if it&#39;s theirs and get money from there.<br/>It&#39;s like you cut photographs from newspapers and make scrapbook collages from them, claiming all of them as yours and then selling them to other people.<br/>The quantity is irrelevant because the quality weighs more on this matter, even one abuse can be considered a crime.<br/><br/>If AI-generated material is found to infringe on a copyrighted work, the developer of a generative AI model and the developer of the system incorporating that model will be liable for the infringement because they are the ones who built it to be so.<br/>End users of the system and other parties, if involved, will be the secondary liable for the probability of foolishness, misuse, and/or accidental use caused by ignorance.<br/><br/>In summary, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s important for humans to use generative AI. <br/>These kinds of tools have the potential to make people more lazy, unproductive and prone to unfairness.<br/>The benefit is not worthy for humanity. Generative AI only ruins the art market.<br/>Please rethink again about the existence of this kind of technology. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading up to this point.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>NisaRF
