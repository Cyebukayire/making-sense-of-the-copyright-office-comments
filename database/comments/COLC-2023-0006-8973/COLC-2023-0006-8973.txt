There should be an extremely high standard for whether or not you can copyright AI generated art or text. Personally, I think you shouldn&#39;t be able to copyright generated text at all because you&#39;re really just remixing the underlying training data. <br/><br/>More importantly, TRAINING an AI on a writer&#39;s (or artist&#39;s or actor&#39;s or musician&#39;s) work should be prohibited without full consultation, meaningful consent, and generous compensation via a negotiated, fully informed OPT IN license with the writer/artist themselves.  (Definitely not an opt out license, those are close to a scam by AI companies.) And that includes cases like those of profession writers working under a Writers Guild of America contract, where we are doing WORK FOR HIRE.  In that case the training right should be retained by the original author, not the person who gets to hold the copyright (i.e., studios.)
