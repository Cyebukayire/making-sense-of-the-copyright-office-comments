Technology has an incredible potential to do good but the way that all current generative models run would make it frankly impossible for any good to come out of this. Everything posted anywhere online regardless of who and of what is being feed into these models. There is no good way to stop this, as new models would create new web scrapers and require webhosts to update their programs to disallow them. This is why no generative Ai should should be afforded any copyright as the data is soured all the way down. There is no way to properly curate 5 billion images from public domain works nor from illegal images. There would be no way for anyone&#39;s rights to be observed nor respected. Generative Ai makers have thus pointed to &quot;opt out&quot;. Stability Ai, open Ai and Meta have all touted that this is the answer. It isn&#39;t as this requires that the copyright holder to jump through hoops for each and every company but it&#39;s also difficult to do so.<br/>https://www.wired.com/story/meta-artificial-intelligence-data-deletion/<br/> It&#39;s not even &quot;opt out&quot; as they make it out to be. The program never &quot;forgets&quot; anything as the companies just block based off of key words like the artist name. Not one who creates anything would be able to live off their own work as thousands of copies are pumped on every website. It&#39;s why generative AI cannot be afforded any Fair Use. It has done incredible amount of damage to the market of free lance illustrators. More and more clients are turning to Gen Ai for Book covers, Article illustrations and Advertisement imagery all the while being able to create a &quot;good enough&quot; duplicate version of their work. All the while never paying anything. It&#39;s nor fair nor should be even considered &quot;Fair Use&quot;.
