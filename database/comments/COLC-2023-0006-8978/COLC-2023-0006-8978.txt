You need to mandate an extremely high standard for whether or not anyone can copyright AI generated art or text. I personally think you shouldn&#39;t be able to copyright generated text at all because companies are really just remixing the underlying training data.  TRAINING an AI on a writer&#39;s (or artist&#39;s or actor&#39;s or musician&#39;s) work should be prohibited without full consultation, meaningful consent, and generous compensation via a negotiated, fully informed OPT IN license with the writer/artist themselves.  Definitely NOT an opt out license, those are close to a scam by AI companies.  In the case of writers, the training right should be retained by the original author, not the person who gets to hold the copyright (IE, studios.)
