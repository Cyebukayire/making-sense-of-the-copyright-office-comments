If properly regulated, Artificial Intelligence is a tool that has tremendous potential to our the world a better place. However, in its current place, I&#39;m seeing job loss, theft, harassment, and disinformation campaigns.<br/><br/>Individual&#39;s work is being taken without their consent and sold without compensation to those who provide said data sets. I&#39;m seeing layoffs across industries, denigration of products produced, and stagnation in the transfer of commerce as buyers lose faith in the quality of available goods. AI, in lieu of workers, hurts the economy and reduces the amount of capital available to the market. <br/><br/>Extremist Groups and Disinformation Campaigns are using these tools to fabricate narratives and produce false media that harm the people&#39;s ability to trust their public institutions and the individuals who run it. False Accusations and Generated Evidence is being created daily to hurt public and private figures and infringe on their individual rights. This technology is being used to create false political statements by political figures and deep fake nudes of celebrities and private citizens either with the intent to harass or profit off of others. Each day, it becomes more difficult to distinguish between forged Audio and Visuals and, as a result, gives power to those who wish to undermine our democracy. <br/><br/>The only path forward with this technology is one where certain factors are applied: continued compensation to those who provided the data used by these models, opt-out as the default of these data sets with opting in only being available after informed consent has been obtained, all previous models built off of scraped data must be deleted with the possibility of damages being paid to those who had the product of their labor stolen, and AI work must continue to be unable to by copy-written without continued compensation and consent of the individuals who make up their data sets. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, the current marketplace of Artificial Intelligence is built upon theft and plagiarism. In any other forum, this is grounds for criminal prosecution and censure. We cannot allow these criminal acts to become a part of our institutions. I fully support the technological innovators who are attempting to benefit mankind with this technology, but we must not allow space for those who would harm our society for the sake of their own profit.
