I am a professional actor who relies on my unique voice, and physical features for portrayal of characters for my work.  If AI is unregulated, the studios and streamers could replicate my likeness without my permission based on previous work  I&#39;ve done and eliminate my right to represent myself authentically in the future. This is a dangerous and slippery slope that we as performers must protect our entire industry from.  Without live actors, there need not be any of the other support industries like make up and hair, costumes, lighting, cameras, etc and a whole facet of our industry and livelihood will die.  This is a danger to us all.  We cannot let their greed govern the right for us to own our own images and how they are portrayed.
