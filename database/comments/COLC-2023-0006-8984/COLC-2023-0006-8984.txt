Hello, I am an artist and a freelancer for hire.  I&#39;ve spent my entire life honing my craft, visiting art school for my BFA and learning animation, screenplay writing, and illustration.  A.I wasn&#39;t around when I graduated.  The market was already over saturated with creatives then, but I pushed through and made my own business of it. This new generation now faces a new, terrible competition that threatens all artists and writers by replacing us with a cheap facsimile.  A.I is seen by the masses as a way to circumvent paying an artist or writer to use their skills to create for your project. However the dataset these generators were trained on is ripped from millions of creators and artworks used without our consent. It&#39;s designed to reference off of the dataset that was sourced illegally and against our wishes.   It&#39;s designed to obfuscate it&#39;s sources and whom it&#39;s plagiarizing, mixing into an amalgamation of stolen art to create free, easy, stolen art that&#39;s royalty free.  This is dangerous because the transparency of the companies is non existent as to whom it used and when, so no artist or writer gets paid when their work is used to train a new image.  A.I usage is going to put us out of work while relying upon our very own creations to feed it.  Artists can exist without AI to create, learn, and grow.  But A.I generators cannot exist without Artists to feed it.  Please take a stand against this, recognize the dangers it poses to every creative field and industry professional. A.I artwork is stolen, and a line needs to be drawn to either compensate every artist it has sourced from, allow us to opt in or out voluntarily, or to have these companies massively fined for fraud and a new dataset created from scratch.  It was never a out protecting artists and allowing new people to generate funny images.  It was about cheapening our craft, replacing us, and racing to buy out any creative project to the lowest bidder.  Please, if you read this, know that hundreds of thousands of artists across the world are watching, and a majority doesn&#39;t want this.  Being replaced by our own plagiarized art.  Many in my communities are giving up already, losing the very human spark that has driven us to create since the earliest cave paintings. Please make an example of these companies, and fine them so harshly that nobody will have the audacity to steal so much from our community again.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading,<br/>Jeremy Hayes - Class of 2004 Alumini Columbus college of Art &amp; Design.
