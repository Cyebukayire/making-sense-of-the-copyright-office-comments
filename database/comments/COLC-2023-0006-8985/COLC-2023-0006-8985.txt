&quot;Generative AI art&quot; is simply not new art. It takes components from other (usually art scraped and taken without permission) and spits out an often poor interpretation of &quot;art&quot;. Art is about the human aspect. Many major models are made from stolen work, and while there&#39;s no problem with an ethical dataset (nothing is taken without express permission), these dirty models are an advanced form of theft. Developers have had to implement protections that, upon scraping of the art, will corrupt datasets, because artists are tired of fighting AI built upon the theft of their own work. There need to be strict regulations regarding usage of AI or else it will spiral out of control and create only cheap imitations of art.
