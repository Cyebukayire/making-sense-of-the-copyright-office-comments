Generative AI should not be allowed to be copyrighted. Artwork is by nature a finite thing- made my human hands, using any one of thousands methods. The use of the works to train an artificial algorithm created by a computer should be considered a basic infringement on the work of the original artist, as often, no compensation is offered to the artist. Their work is stolen. No copyright can be applied to a work that is stolen, whether art made of paint, or that of words, by a thief. &ldquo;Training&rdquo; an AI on someone else&rsquo;s work is theft, plain and simple. <br/>
