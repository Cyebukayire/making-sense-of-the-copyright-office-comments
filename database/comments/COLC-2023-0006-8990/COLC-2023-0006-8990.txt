Artificial Intelligence has the potential to make tasks easier by replacing rote, uncreative work, but the entire point of intellectual property law is to protect people who invest their time, money, and energy into actualizing an original idea from having their work stolen by others with the capital to commercialize their work first. Allowing AI produced work to be copyrighted is completely contrary to this very idea as it allows anyone who wants to invest the capital into buying some computers to run an AI and then training that neural network, often with artwork scrapped off of websites from artists without their permission, to generate artwork for commercial use without having to pay ANYTHING to the artists who created the work that the AI was trained with. This is not only true for Ai image generation but also for AI technology that can replace actors and voice actors in film and television with deepfake copies. Also, we have already seen how AI generated text has created misinformation online that is being spread as truth as search engines reference that text when answering user questions. Similarly, if the commercial use of AI generated media becomes protected by copyright law, training databases will inevitably start to incorporate AI generated images and the artifacts from those images, and as more artists are forced to leave the profession as their work is no longer in demand, eventually there will be too little original work and the AI will begin to fail. This issue has the potential to create a bubble in the industry that is doomed from its inception to pop, and I hope you will consider that as well as the other points I have made before you make the mistake of allowing it to grow any bigger by endorsing AI generated work with legal protection via copyright law.
