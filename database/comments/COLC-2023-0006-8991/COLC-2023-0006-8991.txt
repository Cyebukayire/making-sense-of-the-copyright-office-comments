A single illustration can take me up to 15 hours of work in total, and that&#39;s little compared to other artists with more intricate and realistic art styles. More often than not, I will post the artwork that took that long online and get, if I&#39;m lucky, likes in the single digits and maybe one or two new followers. The algorithm in social media is designed to pump out content constantly and quickly, which is an impossibility with art. In short, the algorithm is against us artists already. For a commission, I will get anywhere between $30 and $200 USD. At 15 hours, that&#39;s an unguaranteed wage of $13.33 USD per hour before taxes. I say unguaranteed because it&#39;s not reliable, sometimes I&#39;ll get a commission, sometimes I won&#39;t, and even when I get a commission, I could get paid more in virtually just about any job I can think of except, maybe, for McDonald&#39;s. This is the reality for countless artists in this country, our passion being just not viable for adequate sustenance. Not only that, but we deal with people downloading our artwork, removing the signature and posting it to their own accounts without credit, consent or compensation, accounts which can do this because they scout the web for art and quickly post it, effectively benefitting from the fast-paced algorithm and stealing views that should belong to the original artist. Of course, there&#39;s also the issue of constant criticism and scrutiny from people who lay eyes in the artwork, all the nitpicking and arguing. It&#39;s exhausting. Yet artists continue to draw and paint because despite all these things, it&#39;s worth it. It&#39;s a labor of love, one treated unfairly, terribly so, but a labor of love at the end of the day. We&#39;ll be mocked and demeaned, nobody takes an artist seriously, especially not one that pretty much only gets to post to social media because they favor composition, anatomy, perspective, color theory, texture, etc. over taping a banana to the wall (look it up, it&#39;s depressing, the banana taped to the wall). I dare say, as artists, we have enough in our plates as it is, but then comes AI to steal our work and Frankenstein it into new uncanny images in a matter of seconds, effectively turning out work against us. You can go on any number of AI image generators and type the name of an artist in there, and the AI will come up with an image very much in the style of the artist. Type the idea, bam, post it, now our work isn&#39;t only being taken to be reposted, now it&#39;s being taken to mix and match with the works of others to compete with us unfairly, and those doing it dare call themselves artists, like they&#39;re our equals, like they spent years of studying and relentless effort, swimming against the current, just to be able to put a pretty image on paper or on a screen after a number of hours of work in the double digits. The algorithm benefits AI images because they&#39;re so abundant and easy to produce and post. This has cost artists commission work already, plenty. Our livelihoods are at stake, like working in art weren&#39;t as hard and risky enough, AI is here to make it even worse. However, artists would take less of an issue with this if only our work weren&#39;t taken and turned against us without consent or compensation. They&#39;re taking our copyrighted work, repackaging it and selling it for their benefit, benefit which we don&#39;t see a dime of. The systems to &quot;opt out&quot; of data sets are put in place in a way that makes it effectively impossible to truly opt out, having to scout artwork after artwork, making the whole process just about as time-consuming and tiring as creating new art, but without the results of having created something to be proud of and without the ability to profit off it. This is why AI should be strictly regulated. It should be trained ethically with opt-in data sets only, using only work they&#39;re authorized to use after asking for permission from the artist providing the artwork and compensating them according to a mutual agreement. Otherwise, simply, flatly, plainly, AI &quot;Art&quot; is theft of the lowest kind; theft designed to suppress and disable the victim. Things are bad enough for artists already. We need a break, not more obstacles to reach a modicum of success. We&#39;re not asking to be given anything, we&#39;re just asking for laws to be put in place to prevent more being taken from us, more than already is taken from us with impunity. We deserve better than this, all of us.
