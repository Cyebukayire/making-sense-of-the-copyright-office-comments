I am a proud member of the Animation Guild. I have been a designer in the video games and animation industry for 5 years but have been drawing, painting, and working on my craft my entire life. I have been posting my personal and commercial work online for the past 10 years because it is one of the only ways to reach potential clients and other job opportunities. I am now in direct competition with generative AI and my work might be used as training data (if it hasn&#39;t already). I am very concerned with copyright law and policy issues regarding AI systems. I dont think it&#39;s right that a company can scrap everyone&#39;s life work from the internet and use it to create a for profit product that is in direct competition with the people that was stolen from without consent, credit, or compensation. Why would I continue to post my work if it is going to be scrapped and used to replace me? Why would anyone do that? We know that the quality of the training data correlates to the quality of the output, and these products wouldn&rsquo;t be as successful as they are without the names and artwork of living working artists today. The creative class must be protected from these unethical practices. <br/>
