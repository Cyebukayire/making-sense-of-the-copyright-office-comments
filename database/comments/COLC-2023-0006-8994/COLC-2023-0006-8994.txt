Hello.<br/>Personally, I feel that AI-generated &quot;Art&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Voice&quot; and &quot;Video&quot;. It should be heavily regulated, as it negatively impacts all the artists, musicians, voice actors, and real people whose work or likeness is used without their permission.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>A concerned US. Citizen
