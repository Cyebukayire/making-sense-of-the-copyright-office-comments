I am an individual artist and currently finishing my Bachelor&rsquo;s in Fine Arts. I and many of my peers are highly concerned about the lack of legal protections for visual artists, because we are about to enter the industry where our careers will be questioned and jeopardized by AI. I am not a professional in anything yet, nor am I an expert, but I will say that what I and my peers make comes from the heart, our unique lived experiences, and a desire to tell the world about them, and artificial intelligence has none of these. To refute the argument that AI will make visual arts more accessible, I and my artist peers all started from nothing. Many of them are not in art school and are self-taught. We all learn from each other, and what influences we do take from each other are transformed into something new, with our individual artistic voices. I feel one of the most major differences between human artists and AI prompt writing is that a human artist can raise a dispute with another human artist about copyright infringement and a resolution is always possible. If a human artist claims copyright infringement against an artificial intelligence, there is no resolution and there is no judgment passed. The human artist will always have to let the artificial intelligence go on producing work that could be considered plagiarism. <br/><br/>Attached is a paper about AI art and its impact on human artists. <br/><br/>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681
