Regarding Artificial Intelligence, I believe it should not hold any copy right value. Ai image generation and text generation revolves around scanning data sources all over the web, &#39;public data&#39; except it isn&#39;t. This &quot;public data&quot; google, Apple, openai all refer to is copy righted material that has a digital connection, such as a web version of a book or artists&#39; posts online. All of this is fed into it like a printing machine, to quickly, within seconds, create an image/text based of user prompt. All of this material is owned by the artists and authors who are having all their work scraped and plagiarized, some just straight up stolen. Human work and effort should be valued across the United States, that&#39;s what we all are after all, united people. <br/>A machine creator unfair compettion on top of the stolen data sets, how could any human artist or author even compete with something that creates in minutes at most? These owners of ai don&#39;t have positive intentions for artists or authors, Sam Altman was quoted saying he hopes for machines to replace &#39;median humans&#39;, these intentions of generative ai are not to be some tool, they are meant to remove artists and authors jobs&#39;. <br/>Giving these lifeless pieces of images/texts in a big factory of mass production copy right value, would cause the loss of many jobs by artists and authors. And tell me this, why should something that requires no work or effort be deemed as copy right worthy? If every penny was worth 100,000 dollars, then 100,000 dollars would be worth nothing because pennies can be mass produced and therefore hold little to no value. Same goes for generative ai, with how it can be mass produced, even a pay wall doesn&#39;t make it any less common then it already is being used. <br/>Humans and machines are very different, machines cannot think like a human can, they can not imagine like a human can, they can&#39;t come up with ideas without referenced images like a human can, anything a generative ai does is programmed into it. The human mind is very unexplored, it&#39;s the most valued organ in the body, it allows us to think, to feel, to imagine, to create, all of which a machine can never do without a human brain. That is why generative ai revolves around theft, it cannot function otherwise. Stolen data is necessary to create these &#39;new things&#39;, in chatgpt&#39;s examples, clusterfunks. <br/>How can this be that bad? Generative ai users can&#39;t generate in an artist&#39;s style and chatgpt can&#39;t grant you a free version of harry potter<br/>Except it can, in that first case at least. While certain prompts may be blocked, many have found ways around this to generate pictures to represent an artist&#39;s work, for example, Van Gouh&#39;s stary night painting has been plagiarized on major generative ai platforms like Dalle-3, midjourney, and stable diffusion. And don&#39;t think authors don&#39;t get hurt either. You can generate a song in a certain artist&#39;s style to get lyrics, and you can generate very near the same books as authors, but like stated earlier, this can take years for an author, this machine takes only a few minutes. <br/>While artists have developed ways to protect artwork, such as glaze and upcoming nightshade, authors have no way to protect their copy righted property, the most they can do is find out if they have been ai trained on out dated websites. Yet writers some writers have used midjourney generated images for their book covers while they are both being harmed. <br/>The main point being made that ai will and never can have any monetary value, no one would buy something they can just generate themselves for cheaper. Copy right is owning your own work, generative ai does not have it&#39;s own work, therefore, cannot hold any copy right value.
