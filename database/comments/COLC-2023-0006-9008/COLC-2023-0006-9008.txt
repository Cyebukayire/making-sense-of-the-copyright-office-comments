I&#39;m a voice actor. AI is a serious threat to my livelihood and vague wording regarding AI simulation of my voice in contracts that I refused to sign/they refused to change the wording of has lost me work. I also fear how it will be used politically - fake videos of politicians and other public figures saying things they never have actually said. Just think - that kind of technology could be used to start wars.
