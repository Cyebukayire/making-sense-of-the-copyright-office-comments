(I&#39;m not a native english speaker, so I&#39;m sorry for any grammatical mistake)<br/>Q 1 : As a visual artists I do not see any benefit in using an algorithm that do 100% of the work for me, it also create an incentive for people to use AI to imitate an artist specific style without having to pay said artist.<br/>Q 2 : It greatly devalue our work and create incentive for people to use those AI system instead of paying us for our work. LORA (fine tuned model on specific artists) are also often used to harrass and bully artists online who voiced their concern regarding AI technology.<br/>Q 6 : they scrap the entire web for images, always without consent from right holder.<br/>Q 6.1: To my knowledge most of them initially used the LAION dataset which was created in germany and was supposed to be used for research only, not to create a commercial product.<br/>Q 6.2: They do not ask for permission and use everything they can get their hands on without offering any form of compensation to the artists used to train their model.<br/>Q 8 : it is impossible for it to be fair use since those images generator directly compete with the original on the same market. It create incentives for people to not hire artists and instead pay those AI companies to produce work &quot;in the style of (insert artist name)&quot;. It is clearly unfair competition and should not be considered fair use.<br/>Q 8.3 : It should never be considered fair use when they are used for commercial purpose, like I said since they directly compete with the original on the same market, and considering the speed and scale at which AI can imitate our work, it cannot be considered fair use.<br/>Q 9 : To my knowledge opt-out is against the Bern Convention, and there is no guarantee that they will respect it. Opt-in is the only viable solution.<br/>Q 9.5 : Yes, we should have the right to refuse to have our work used to train our replacement.<br/>Q 15 : Yes, they need to be transparant about what is used to train their model, and should face severe penalties for unauthorized use of copyrighted work.<br/>Q 18 : No, since the vast majority of the work is done by a machine.<br/>Q 28 : Yes, AI output should always be labeled as AI generated as it is often used by bad actors to scam or generate false information. It is the responsability of tech companies behind those system to find ways to prevent those algorithm from being used for nefarious purposes, and governement should severly punish companies who do not put enough safeguard to prevent bad actors from using the technology.
