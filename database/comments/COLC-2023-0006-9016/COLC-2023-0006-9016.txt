The infiltration, intrusions and dangers of AI will be felt in every quarter of American life very shortly, but the frontline is going to be fought in the entertainment industry. Currently our union is fighting the AMPTP that wishes to include identity theft and the theft of intellectual property as part of its goals. Making the very image and thoughts of the human artist its own. To steal someone&#39;s likeness or intellect has dangerous, dehumanizing, political and far reaching implications past video games and movies. If we cannot protect our identity, our likeness, our voices in the entertainment field there will be nothing that AI will not consume in other industries. We need your help to stop the buck here.
