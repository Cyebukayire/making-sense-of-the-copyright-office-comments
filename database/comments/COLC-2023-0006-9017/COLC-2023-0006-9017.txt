Ai art and generative ai with the intent of recreating or replacing human contribution to creative work is unethical, theft and a vehicle for disinformation and abuse. I&#39;ve already seen artists work being recreated with the signature still attached to the ai immigration. I&#39;ve seen ai used to spread misinformation about israels genocide against Palestine. I&#39;ve seen ai used to create fake porn from non consenting people to their distress. If an ai can create fake nudity with nonconsenting adult women, what does that mean for children? If ai art and other generative ai is allowed to run rampant as it is it will create an industry of theft,  abuse, misinformation and danger. It needs to be heavily monitored and regulated.
