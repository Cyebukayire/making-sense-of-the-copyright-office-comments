AI, or in reality here, machine learning, is new and emerging. This makes these policies incredibly poignant and important to get right. Therefore I greatly appreciate this issue being open to comment. Art is a vital work of humanity, and I support artists and their talents. Like any other profession which requires years of study, practice and diligence, I believe they should be compensated accordingly. I firmly believe that artists permission be required before their work be used in a training data set, and compensation terms be included in the consent. Machine learning cannot do what artists do, cannot fill that vital role in society. That is not to say it is without purpose, but the bounds of its training must be carefully monitored. I also believe that work produced from machine learning should not be eligible for copyright. Given that it is mimicking styles from its data set, anything it produces is an amalgam of others work more than anything truly unique itself. This translates to written work and code as well. Anything that machine learning produces presents potential detriment to the sectors of work it is producing. I believe it should be a violation of the Copyright Act to allow generative &ldquo;AI&rdquo; to use copyrighted work without consent of the original owner of that work. I am grateful for your time and attention to this important matter.
