Generative AI systems will ultimately only harm the creative workspaces that our culture depends on for entertainment, fashion, music, film, and more. By removing the human element from the equation, we remove the humanity required to create art. Copyrighted material is already being scraped into these machines of pure thievery and being used to creation muddied replicas of originals. This is also stealing independent works and disheartening to see for the budding generation of artists. Imagine building yourself from the ground up over decades, and watching your entitled neighbor claim your best works for themselves? How can the public ever trust AI as it&rsquo;s already built on deception and theft?<br/>AI generated material is already being utilized on YouTube to pose as political figureheads or trusted and beloved celebrities to scam the elderly and the young who do not know any better. The use of real peoples likenesses, other people&rsquo;s art, etc should be halted IMMEDIATELY and made into a crime for its use. <br/>How important is it for there to be international consistency in this area? EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Especially in the case of political figureheads likenesses being used to create tensions between countries. 1) AI has entirely no benefits at this time regarding image generation and similar endeavors. It is ONLY risk and harm. <br/>How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, and the public? The public is losing faith in the validity of artistic creations now, and also in the ability to keep personal works from being used to generate stolen imagery. This harms small artists and large corporations based on art and mascots as well. <br/>In order to allow copyright owners to determine whether their works have been used, developers of AI models and/or creators of training datasets should be required to collect, retain, and disclose records regarding the materials used to train their models. This will make it entirely clear just how much of the bedrock of this awful technology is built on stolen work.<br/>Humans using AI generative software should not be considered &lsquo;authors&rsquo; as much as those plagiarizing written works should not be considered &lsquo;authors&rsquo;. It is all thievery.<br/>If AI-generated material is found to infringe a copyrighted work, the developer of a generative AI model, the developer of the system incorporating that model, end users of the system, and all other parties omitting those whose work was stolen to train the software should be held immediately and directly liable. All makers and users of this tech know what they are doing but see only dollar signs at the end of a few sparsely worded prompts. <br/>ALL AI USED IN PUBLIC OR ADVERTISING OR BY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND MORE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE AND REQUIRED TO LABEL IT AS AI. <br/>Artists need to be PROTECTED and we are reaching out desperately for these pleas to be heard and heeded. Artificial image and likeness generators need to be dismantled before more dire issues arise past the theft of personal works. This has the potential to cause immense political unrest among our aging population and government officials. <br/>Please do not fail us.
