My issue with AI in it&#39;s current state is their datasets are not ethically sourced. Many of the larger datasets have scraped all images off of the internet, without the rightful owners permission. I don&#39;t think that if I were to upload my art to the internet, AI models should be allowed to use my copyrighted art for their datasets, and produce AI generated art with it. Any results from AI generated art should never be allowed to be copyrighted or even more importantly used commercially, unless the dataset of that AI is proven to be ethically sourced. Ethically sourced meaning, every piece of data would have to be proven to be added to the dataset with the consent of the original owner of that image/piece of literature/music/art etc.
