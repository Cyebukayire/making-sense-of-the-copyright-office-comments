Artists do not believe AI is evil, but being misused. A very large reason we are against it is because it currently operates without consent, credit and compensation. Our work is being directly fed into datasets. There should never be a place in time where artists have to &quot;opt out&quot; of a very possible damaging application and third party use of our creations. Large companies that produce AI generative creations should delete and restart their datasets all together to produce a fair use set the public may use without stealing from artists of any kind. New precautions for artists , such as &quot;Glaze &quot;and more recently the mention of &quot;Nightshade&quot; , are the only tool us artists have at our disposal to create a safe environment for us to post out work publicly. It makes it so AI users can&#39;t just take any piece of imagery they want to generate. It gives artists,  like myself, some ease knowing my work even if wrongfully stolen and fed Into a dataset, will not further that datasets&#39; knowledge of my work. There is absolutely nothing wrong with protecting our work if it&#39;s going to be stolen by larger companies first and that&#39;s what should have been taken into consideration even before AI&#39;s production.  Copyright , consent, and compensation. I&#39;d like to see AI do amazing things, just not from a mass of self-reported stolen work of others.
