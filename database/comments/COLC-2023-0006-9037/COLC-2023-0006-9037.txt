I&#39;m a technology executive with over 15 years of experience leading design teams and building technology start-ups. For the last 10 years, I&#39;ve also been an independent artist. My art installations about American public policy have been covered in the Washington Post, Bloomberg, and Hyperallergic. Without my successful career in technology, I simply could not afford to invest in my art career to achieve the platform and critical/institutional success I have as an artist today. I&rsquo;m an immigrant with no access to intergenerational wealth. I was able to afford my MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York City because the first start-up I worked at was acquired by Google. I used the windfall to pay for my degree. It&rsquo;s absurd that I need to work a full-time technology job to support an art career in which I can choose the stories I tell and how to tell them, without being beholden to private buyers or brand sponsorships. Due to the rise of copyright theft and mass firings of artists and other creative workers, directly connected to the increased adoption of generative AI tools, I fear that in just a few short years, creative workers will have fewer and fewer opportunities to make a living wage and tell the stories that only they can tell.<br/><br/>As an artist and technology leader, I&rsquo;m deeply troubled by advancements in generative AI that plagiarize art, actively harm the financial livelihoods of creative workers today (especially those who come from communities like mine that are underrepresented in the art world, as well as the many artists living close to or under the poverty line), and create destructive market forces that will upend the careers of the next generation of cultural workers. <br/><br/>The power of American culture can only go so far as the health and strength of the people that make it happen: artists, musicians, actors, writers, designers, and every creative discipline in between, many of whom are struggling in the present to stay out of debt and make a living wage. See the measurable harms documented in this ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) paper published by leading AI ethics researchers and artists, &ldquo;AI Art and its Impact on Artists&rdquo; for more details: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3600211.3604681<br/><br/>I strongly urge this decision-making body to incorporate the Core Principles of AI Applications published by the Human Artistry Campaign into its regulations, outlined in full here: https://www.humanartistrycampaign.com/ <br/><br/>To me, relevant principles to the questions requested by this body are:  <br/><br/>&ldquo;Use of copyrighted works, and the use of voices and likenesses of professional performers, requires authorization and&nbsp; free-market licensing from all rights-holders.  &hellip;As with predecessor technologies, the use of copyrighted works requires permission from the copyright owner. AI must be subject to free-market licensing for the use of works in the development and training of AI models. Creators and copyright owners must retain exclusive control over determining how their content is used. AI developers must ensure any content used for training purposes is approved and licensed from the copyright owner, including content previously used by any pre-trained AIs they may adopt. Additionally, performers&rsquo; and athletes&#39; voices and likenesses must only be used with&nbsp;their consent and fair market compensation for specific uses.&rdquo;   <br/><br/>&ldquo;Governments should not create new&nbsp;copyright or other IP exemptions that allow AI developers to exploit creators without permission or compensation. <br/>AI must not receive exemptions from copyright, right of publicity, or other intellectual property rights and must comply with core principles of fair market competition and compensation. Creating special shortcuts or legal loopholes for AI would harm creative livelihoods, damage creators&rsquo; brands, and limit incentives to create and invest in new works.&rdquo;<br/><br/>More background about my tech and art careers: <br/>I&rsquo;ve designed major technology systems for HealthCare.gov, the Department of Veteran Affairs, and the state of Vermont, served as a Code for America Fellow, co-founded a $50 million fintech start-up called Propel, and co-founded a technology nonprofit, Trestle Collaborative.<br/><br/>As an artist, I make interactive installations that make complex social issues understandable and actionable for everyday people. Tens of thousands of people have seen my installations, which have shown in selective shows like NYC&#39;s Data X Design Festival and a 2 year touring exhibit called Food Justice, with stops at museums in OH, PA, and MA. My art career is supported by grants, teaching, and art sales. I&#39;ve been fortunate to receive grant funding from Stanford University, HumanitiesDC, and the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center. Even though my art has been celebrated by leading cultural institutions and publications, it&rsquo;s only in my 10th year as a working artist that I&#39;ve made a modest profit on my work.<br/> <br/><br/>
