If AI is allowed to continue as it is currently, value will be siphoned out of creative industries to tech companies. After all, this technology is not developed by artists, artists will not reap the benefits or profits of this technology, and yet it requires their work for it to function.. If left unregulated, a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; scenario is likely to ensue, artists&#39; hard work, which they left in the open for the benefit of everyone, will be used to replace them. This is unfair and morally bankrupt. Granting copyright protection to AI would only hasten this outcome.<br/><br/>Link to an academic paper &quot;AI Art and its impact on Artists&quot;<br/>https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3600211.3604681
