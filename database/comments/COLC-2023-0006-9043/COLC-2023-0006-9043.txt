I am a US citizen and pay my taxes every year. I write books as a hobby and some of my book covers were drawn by me. The cover of my book titled Quandary with an ISBN 978-1541398429 is listed on the haveibeentrained.com dataset. This cover is my drawing, I drew it using photoshop and painted with a mouse. I have the original PSD file to show proof of each layer of the drawing was done fully by me. That book cover was added to the LAION database without my permission. I did not give anyone permission to use my copyrighted art and I am obviously not getting financially compensated for this breach. These companies think they can stomp on the little guy.<br/><br/>I demand fair compensation for copyright payments. I want my royalties!!!
