This really shouldn&#39;t even be in question. Generative AI companies, and the hedge funds that manage them, do not have consent to use our art to train their datasets. Period. When they do so without our consent, it constitutes an act of theft. Period. What is there to debate? Is telling rich people &quot;No, you can&#39;t do whatever you want&quot; really so difficult? Working class people go to jail every day for theft of goods and services. So why does Sam Altman get a pass? He&#39;s committing theft. That makes him a thief. Go get him.<br/><br/>The fact that we have to go to third parties, like Glaze or Nightshade, to get solutions is downright disgraceful. The US Copyright Office should be embarrassed. Neither of those third party apps is a true solution that most artists are comfortable with. Both Nightshade and Glaze, while effective at stopping art theft, have an enormous carbon footprint. They&#39;re only stop-gap measures to keep our work form being STOLEN while regulators make up their minds about whether or not to enforce the damned law.<br/><br/>Image generation AI and its counterparts have shown no utility outside of exploitation for profit by a small handful of investment groups. The fact that we&#39;re seeing videos of celebrities and politicians in fake AI vids should give y&#39;all pause to consider the implications of letting this tech run rampant without any regulation. I know nobody cares about whether or not artists starve, but they should care about political propaganda and psi-ops that are, to the untrained eye, virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. The US has plenty of adversaries who would jump at the chance for that kind of misinformation tool. I know... because they&#39;re already using it on Twitter and Facebook to spread misinformation. Maybe let the old folks in Congress know, because their interns having been doing a good job of informing them how the internet works.<br/><br/>I think I speak for most artists when I say we&#39;d really appreciate it if regulatory authorities would get off their butts and do something about this. Generative AI is committing the largest art burglary in history, and doing it in broad daylight, while lawmakers sit around and twiddle their thumbs. They&#39;re stealing form us, stealing from the global economy, and using what they steal to rig the art market. How is ANY of this legal? If I stole the intellectual property of a Hedge Fund investor, I&#39;d already be in a cell. It&#39;s an affront to the Rule of Law that they be allowed to steal form millions of artists worldwide, with absolutely no repercussions.<br/><br/>In summation, plenty of irreparable harm has already been caused by this tech. Artists are quitting in droves, politicians in fake videos are saying really vile stuff, and film studios are trying to steal the likenesses and work of actors and writers. It&#39;s getting out of hand. Any measures you take moving forward can only prevent future harm. Generative AI is the stuff of nightmares, and it needs to be clamped down on. HARD. Enforce the existing laws or write new ones... whatever, just shut those servers down. The question of whether or not to do so is only difficult if one has no concept of justice. The images within those datasets are not the property of these companies.<br/><br/>Although, we really shouldn&#39;t have to ask: Please stop these AI companies from stealing from artists.
