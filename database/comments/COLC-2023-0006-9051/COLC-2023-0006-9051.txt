I&#39;m a Canadian art student currently studying at an American University, the issue of AI specifically generative AI concerns me. These models have been built on the backs of artists and is being used to replace us. As a student this is very concerning because entry level jobs are most exposed to this, meaning there is a significant possibility an industry that is already hard to break into will become even harder. I know I&#39;m not American, but American does influence the rest of the world. Please set standards for the rest of the world and regulation this technology so creatives like me can&#39;t be abused by this technology.
