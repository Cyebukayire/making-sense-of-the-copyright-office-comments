I am currently a 20 years old college student who enjoys looking at artworks of those who are much more skilled in drawing and illustrating when compared to me. It irks me in a weird way to witness the beginning of the rise of individuals generating images with AI models, posting it online, and claiming that they &quot;created it.&quot; It is still a problem to this day, many are claiming AI-generated images as their own, and are providing commission work for people who will pay them while not disclosing that the images that they are providing their customers are AI-generated. There are many talented artists in the world that contribute to the media that almost all of us have consumed, from classic Disney or Pixar films and animated movies to the increasing popularity of animations in the United States. Artists are more prevalent than ever, it is a valued skill that these artists have decided to commit themself with a very slim chance of being able to live off of their drawing. &quot;Starving artists&quot; can be used to describe artists in the past when animations weren&#39;t as prevalent in media as they were today, it can be still be used today as the majority of artists only do what they do as a side hobby. AI models and those that abuse the models are trying to get the meager profit that is in the illustration commission that exists online. It is extremely insulting to these artists and illustrators as the AI models wouldn&#39;t exist if it was not trained on the work of already existing artists. I will admit that I don&#39;t know as much about what kind of regulations I would want, but there are many industry veteran that you can listen to. I urge you to consider their plead, as it is much nicer on everyone&#39;s eyes if artists can keep drawing, as an AI won&#39;t be able to come up with new ideas as it is trained off of past works.
