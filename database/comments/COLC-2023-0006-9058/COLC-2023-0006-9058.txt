Name: Kelsey &quot;Kat&quot; Berkley.<br/>I am a video game concept artist and have worked in the game industry for more than a decade. I believe that AI tools such as Midjourney are inherently unethical and destructive and that they should be dismantled. I&#39;ve extensively tested them to see if they would be useful at my job and I am certainly by no means opposed to technological progress. However, upon testing these tools it immediately became clear to me that they were built upon a foundation of mass IP theft. With prompts, it was very easy for me to replicate the look and feel of the work of many of my colleagues and peers who regularly share their work online on websites such as Artstation or Twitter (now X.) It&#39;s clear to me that these tools would not be able to work in the impressive way that they do without the mass theft of the work of artists like myself and my peers. Their existence is unethical. They should never have been created and they should be ordered to be destroyed
