I&rsquo;m firmly against the use of ai technology as it&rsquo;s being used now and I&rsquo;m in huge support of action being taken to protect creators from having their work stolen in this way. At the moment there are only few precautions that can be taken such as the programs glaze and nightshade which intend to &ldquo;poison&rdquo; the images taken from non-consenting creators. However these solutions are fickle as AI continues to develop and find ways to continue exploiting these creators. At this time creators are having their work taken, put into datasets and churned into distorted copies where the creator doesn&rsquo;t see a cent of profit for their hard labor. If nothing is done the creative industry will eventually become nothing but a cycle of exploitive meshes of existing ideas and a void of unemployment.
