We write to you on behalf of the Center for AI and Digital Policy (CAIDP), in response to the notice of inquiry and request for comments (RFC) issued by the U.S. Copyright Office on Artificial Intelligence and Copyright.  In the Comments below we provide (1) general recommendations on AI and Copyright and (2) responses to specific questions set out by the Copyright Office. We have also promoted this opportunity for public comment on AI policy through our Public Voice project. <br/><br/>In summary, we recommend: <br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The U.S. Copyright Office should ensure that the development of AI systems is human-centered and trustworthy. The value of copyright is recognized in the U.S. Constitution  and is integral to the livelihood of millions of creators, actors, artists, designers, musicians, photographers, poets, writers and many others in the United States.<br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Accountability and transparency mechanisms to ensure governance of AI techniques should incorporate best practices set out in the Universal Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence,  the OECD AI Principles,  and the UNESCO Recommendations on AI Ethics. <br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The allocation of rights concerning those who are impacted by AI systems should be based on pre-deployment assessments, audits, certifications throughout the AI lifecycle to ensure transparency, explainability, accountability, and traceability.<br/><br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Legal standards should also be established to ensure AI transparency and accountability. Accountability mechanisms or practices will have no meaningful impact in the absence of clearly defined legal standards and enforceable remedies.<br/>
