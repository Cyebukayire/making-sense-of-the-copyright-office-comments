Thank you for hosting this comment box. I appreciate it greatly.<br/>It seems that most of what AI image generation is being used for is to avoid paying artists. I am very happy with the decision that AI generated content cannot be copyrighted. It&rsquo;d be like copyrighting pages from the Library of Babel. <br/>I am disappointed with how hard many people work to get around copyright law to get paid for generating content with AI. I would like it if there were a way to enforce a watermark system on AI content, or perhaps some sort of mandatory digital tagging.<br/>In my most extreme view, I feel that if any generative AI was used to make a product, that product should not be copyrightable, even if the AI generated parts were only a small percentage of the finished work. Copyrighting half a movie is silly. Copyrighting 17 out of every 20 frames of a movie so that no one can meaningfully access the public domain bits seems silly.<br/>Thanks again for the comment box!
