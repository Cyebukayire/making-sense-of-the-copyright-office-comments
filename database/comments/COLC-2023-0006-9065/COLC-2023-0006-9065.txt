I am somone who is studying IT at a German high-school and an artist who draws in my free time. I have been drawing since I was a kid, but due to personal reasons had to stop really early on, and only picked it back up around 3 years ago in 2020. I am a person who is fond of and has tried a lot of mediums, from paper and digital drawing, to music, video game development, and 3d modeling. I did partake in a pixel art contest for a game and a game jam, the experience of this eI will treasure. I could tell it was my callung, even when I was pulled down and suffered from ADHD, weaker hands, OCD and possibly undiagnosed Autism, as Germany takes a while, among other problems, I persisted; even when I made progress at an incredibly slow pace, I knew this was me.<br/><br/>My views on AI were shaped by my own experience, me learning about how current Neural Network models work, and the experience of other creatives.<br/><br/>AI has hit me hard. I first started following it really early on when Google Deepdream was showcased, it&#39;s early uses seemed entertaining and not overly harmful, as I was not yet aware of what it could become past a quirky experiment. Some time after I picked up drawing and as AI developed, I slowly started to question it and learned it&#39;s ethical shortcomings, making it harder to draw due to the pressure of this entire topic. Around one and a half year ago in the spring of 2022 I broke down and could not draw at all. AI made me distance myself from art and grow resentment for doing it, as it seemed no one cared about it&#39;s ethics or regulations, and most of my family did not care either. I managed to recover over the last few months and research it during it.<br/><br/>The Moral shortcomings that I saw and still see are numerous that combine into this singular point. First of, most artists or people who post anything online did not consent to have their content trained on, this manifest in most people not being asked, most lacking knowledge what it does, and a lot of content on the Internet being posted before the recent boom in Generative Models<br/><br/>Second of, there being no consequences of people using AI to replicate a Voice actor&#39;s voice, an artist&#39;s artistic identity and training on other&#39;s content as stated above.<br/><br/>As a consequence of what amount to copyright violations, those individuals who created the original art are not compensated, and lose on revenue to support themselves or interactions with other humans. In turn, this is why it is being described as plagiarism. It&#39;s replicating the abilities of a person who did not consent and is not compensated, with the goal of automating creativity, where AI companies have a stranglehold and overlook over art. This is the reality artists want to hinder, to deconstruct a tool that is used to exploit others and make it obey the same ethics artists of all mediums have among eachother. Artist fear that huge corporations can just generate art of their likeness for any media.<br/><br/>I would like to debunk the counterargument that pro-AI people use the most, it being that AI learns the same way a human does when they learn and reference art. This argument falls apart once you realize that a Neural Network does not function just like a brain. The algorithms we are speaking of are just probabilistic models, fed a dataset, they can reconstruct combinations of features that in certain orientations that it had parsed, with no further ability to reflect or develop further skills or understanding of our reality. As an example an artist might learn a style of another, but they still through respect and due to human nature make slight creative changes to it, as will never be perfect, while an AI sheds any human aspects of it. <br/><br/>It is also worthwhile to explain why artist do art and care so much about this entire ordeal, from my own personal experience and the general consensus of art communities I was in and artists I talked with. Artists see art as a way to create something from their will, we have a calling to express our emotions, to make things from the subconscious. Artists oftentimes see art as one of their purposes, the thing they somehow gravitate towards. AI taking over spaces where artists could contribute to society, share their works, form communities, or make a living impacts their mental health significantly, as creative people want to be compensated or at least slightly noticed, and other artist&#39;s seeing eachother not able to support themselves only desincentivises them to want to do art. A paper which talks about this: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681.<br/><br/>I know as AI companies will try to lobby, time is running out for regulations. As such, I beg from the bottom of my heart for this plagiarism to stop. I never expected to write anything as heavy is this, but this is a cry for help from somone who has seen it&#39;s effects.<br/><br/>I sincerely thank you for taking your time to read my comment, I hope my perspective contributed in some small way in mapping out the ethics.
