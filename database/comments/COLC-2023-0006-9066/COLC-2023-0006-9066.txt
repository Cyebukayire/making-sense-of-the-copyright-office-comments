I think ai art should stay uncopyrightable without sufficient human touch up. Don&#39;t get me wrong if I use ai as a base for a sketch and do significant touch ups it should be copyrightable. However, I feel like giant corporations will use this as a way to copyright everything, and I&#39;m not okay with that. I feel you can&#39;t copyright styles, and only characters. If there is significant evidence to support a character or copyright material is being published such as mickey mouse for monetary gain, then it can be pursued for a copyright claim. However, I believe datasets are fair use under the current law and precedent since the technology doesn&#39;t use the data exclusively to create art, but new products all of their own. Much akin to photoshop brushes, or filters.
