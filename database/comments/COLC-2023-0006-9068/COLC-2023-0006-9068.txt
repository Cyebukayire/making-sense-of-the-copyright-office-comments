Hello, I am a prospective designer, writing from outside the US. Even though I have started my journey as a designer, I have years of experience writing and taking pictures as well.<br/><br/>The issue with AI is noting that there will be a potential case where it would be more effective to let a computer generate AI rather than coming to a creative. I can understand, but that is taking away a niche of someone to place through taking the work of someone else. That in itself doesn&rsquo;t do much for the creation of sciences and arts. It is laughable to think that the system could take the credit of being the &ldquo;creator&rdquo; whist stealing from people who made the work that &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; it. <br/><br/>I don&rsquo;t believe AI Is entirely bad, but I do believe it needs to be monitored for the work to be fully ethical. The author of the copyrighted work should be notified when there work is used by AI, creators should have a say in if their work should be used for AI.<br/><br/>I hope you consider what I have to say. <br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/><br/>A concerned designer
