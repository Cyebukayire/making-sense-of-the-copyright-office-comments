While the potential applications of LLM AI technology and contemporary AI technology in general, are not to be understated as a person in a creative profession I am pleased to take this opportunity to voice my strong belief that AI-generated material should not be copyrightable. To be brief, and having perused the questions posed in the federal register: I strongly believe that material generated as a result of prompts entered into an AI engine should not be eligible for copyright, as that material does not reflect human authorship nor human discovery. <br/><br/>The long-term risks posed by rampant adoption and greedy deployment of generative AI systems are extensive - annihilation of low-level creative professional jobs such as copywriters and asset creation artists, leading to a general thinning of the herd across many creative ecosystems; a further concentration of wealth in the uppermost reaches of the economy, as those with means could easily farm out mass generation of &quot;copyrightable&quot; AI-generated material to lock new creatives out of the industry; the risk of generative AI that has been trained on copyrighted material vomiting out a slightly altered or effaced copy of a human copyrighted work. Within my industry - the performative arts - the concept has already been presented to us of mandating that actors sign away their likeness rights so that studios can make copyrightable AI facsimiles of them, and writers have only just succeeded in staving off studios&#39; attempts to feed proprietary AI engines a glut of writers&#39; material in hopes that the generative AI can recombine and freely create scripts for the foreseeable future. The desired intent seems to be nothing less than the elimination of creative professionals.<br/><br/>Evidence has been mounting, and in many cases has been freely announced by the powers behind generative AI, that libraries worth of copyrighted material has been used to train LLM AIs. Likewise, it has been no secret that film and television studios hope to use their libraries of films to train AI to create new material. While this is both direct recycling and upscaling of extant, human work, it is also often done without permission and those artists who created that material are not taken into consideration as their work is used in what amounts to an attempt to print money. An AI engine, in this way, does not have a voice; it does not have intent, and it does not have a vision. It simply collates together endless volumes of extant data and spits out a regenerated and Frankensteined copy of others&#39; work. This does not a copyrightable work make. I differentiate this from use of a word processing tool or a computer program such as Adobe Photoshop, as these tools allow the artist complete control over their outcome, and allow them to express their inner creative vision through new media. AI art, writing and video engines do not do this - they echo back the prompter&#39;s input as a homogenization of everything else the engine has devoured, essentially presenting an averaged-out, generalized vision of what the prompter&#39;s input is - not a distillation of the prompter&#39;s creative intent. Lacking creative intent, there lacks creation; lacking any true creation, there can be no pure human agency and no copyright should be granted.<br/><br/>I believe also that human authors should be able to opt their material out of being used for training of generative AI. Additionally, developers of AI models should indeed be required to, as described in question 15, collect, retain and disclose records regarding their materials.<br/><br/>To the points of questions 18-27: I do not believe that a human being who uses a Generative AI system should be considered the author of that material. Legal protection for AI-generated material would be disastrous for human authorship and human generation, as well as essentially boiling down to a wholesale theft from humanity. I believe also that in the event of AI-generated material infringing extant copyright, both  the developer of the model and the end-users should be found liable.<br/><br/>To the points of questions 28-29, I believe the law should require that AI-generated material be identified as being generated by AI in any instance where the material is being used for profit or presented for consideration. <br/><br/>To the points of questions 30-34, I do not believe that AI-generated material that uses a person&#39;s likeness should have any legal rights, and I believe that congress should establish protections against an AI system generating outputs that imitate a human creator&#39;s style. Any and all human creators should be eligible for such protection, which should include opt-out clauses and enforceable legislation guaranteeing human ownership taking precedent over AI-generated material.<br/><br/>I acknowledge that these tools are useful in many ways, but I believe it is of paramount importance that human authorship and copyright be protected to ensure the continued growth of human creativity. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
