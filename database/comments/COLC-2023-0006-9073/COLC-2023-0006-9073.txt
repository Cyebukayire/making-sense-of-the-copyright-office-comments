I am a programmer and systems developer by trade, with a background in Art and design. I have a vocational degree in modern art and a bachelor degree in Game Design and Graphics. I&#39;ve been AI developments for decades, and was originally excited about the potential for AI, but have since become disilusioned by the socioeconomic factors around the development of the tech. I have used [re]generative image models for about one hundred hours, and have been reading about and discussing the topic extensively for over a year and a half. My primary knowledge about the tech is regarding visual media, but I also care about audio (music or voice) and text, though they have different risks, benefits and problems. <br/><br/>I have answered most of the questions in the attached PDF.
