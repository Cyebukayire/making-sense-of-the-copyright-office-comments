AI art, while not being &ldquo;mine&rdquo;, has allowed me to express myself even when my mental illness makes it impossible for me to create traditional art. I don&rsquo;t think it should be copyrighted, but I do think we should have the freedom to generate harmless art in our own homes if we want to. AI art does not harm artists the same way a digital camera doesn&rsquo;t harm an artist. Both are valuable tools that have their place, that can both aid a traditional artist in their creation process. As long as AI art is being generated with considerable human input, there is no one that gets hurt.
