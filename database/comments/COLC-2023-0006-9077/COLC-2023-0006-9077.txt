I address three issues that span ten questions raised in this request for comments. What control does a human have in determining the creation of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) system that replicates their individual &ldquo;creative process,&rdquo; and if such a system is created, what ownership claims or recourse does the human have? What control does the owner of data have over its use in training such a generative AI system? Finally, what claims might a human have over new works created by such a generative AI system? I examine the answers suggested by current law and the direction of policy change that could accelerate innovation and improve economic outcomes in this emerging era of generative AI. <br/><br/>The emergence of generative AI technologies reveals gaps between the economic motivations for copyright protections and the protections likely afforded by current US copyright law. I believe the resolution of ongoing litigation will further underscore these gaps. Economic studies that examine the value perceived by users from works that are generated entirely by AI versus those that are generated by humans, as well as studies that compare the performance of generative AI systems trained on AI-generated data with those trained on human-generated data are essential in determining the appropriate new division of intellectual property (IP) rights. The direction and extent of desirable changes to the law will depend in part on whether the legislature expects a vast majority of future IP to be created by machines rather than humans, and whether it assesses this shift as being beneficial to society.<br/><br/>My detailed comments are in the attached file.<br/>
