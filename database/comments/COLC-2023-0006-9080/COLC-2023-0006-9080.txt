Generative AI Style Transfer Problem<br/><br/>US Representatives need to sponsor, write and pass at least two author&#39;s rights feature to Title 17, US Copyright Law.<br/><br/>Individual author&#39;s, musicians, artists should have <br/>1)legal right to train their own machine learning model on their own copywritten works which they own. AND register that ML, TensorFlow, PyTorch model at the US Copyright Office as software, derivative work in their own name. <br/>2) All new copyright registrations in the registration process, shoukd provide register with ability to formally declare Copyright Register &#39;opts out&#39; of sgreeing to let any individual, corporation or publishing group use this song, text or image in machine learning model teaining. Formalizes legal stand if sole author&#39;s declaration to not let others use registered work in machine model training without written, legal consent.<br/>These two new rights in Title 17 should enable individual authors, musicians to create, officiate their ML model, adding a level of &#39;official model from the artist&#39; author, musician. Enables sole author&#39;s ML model to have more credibility and quality level. If sole author created model is posted on iTunes, Audible, Google Play as a product for sale or license, musicians and authors can profit from their own Gen/Ai Style Transfer model generating income fir sole author as a software app plugin. &#39;Official model&#39; from artist enables artist to participate in the income stream from a Gen AI model. If artists, author&#39;s, musicians don&#39;t own and control Gen/Ai models trained on portfolios of their work, then sole-authors are at risk of losing income due to Gen AI apps from other publishers generating derivative works in the style of the otiginal sole author- keeping them out of the economic income marketplace.
