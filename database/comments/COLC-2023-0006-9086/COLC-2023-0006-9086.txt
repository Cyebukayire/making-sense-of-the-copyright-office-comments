<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If a person copies a piece of text and presents it as their own work, it is plagiarism; if that person copies multiple pieces of text and puts them together and presents it as their own work, it is plagiarism;  if an artificial intelligence produces text derived from copyrighted sources, then it too, should be considered plagiarism. So too with images and audio.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Just as importantly, a world in which artificial intelligence is permitted to reproduce human art, writing, and culture still under copyright, all for a small fee would serve to de-emphasize human creativity and undermine the very point of copyright: to ensure that those who enrich society can continue to do so in their lifetimes, without having their work copied after a few months and given away for free.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>It is undeniable that when access to an artificial intelligence model is sold, the seller is effectively profiting off of both the intellectual property used to produce their model as well as the technical work needed to iterate over the aforementioned intellectual property and fine tune the model after production. When the initial intellectual property is in the public domain or when access to it has been purchased, there is no issue; but currently models are typically produced by processing (and research has found that at times have capacity to reproduce) materials under copyright, without permission.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Generative A.I. products created with public resources cannot and should not be copyrightable. Beyond being in contradiction to the fact of copyright law, the societal and cultural implications would be tragic and transformative in scope. I thus urge the United States Copyright Office to continue to reject copyright filings on any and all generative A.I.-produced work.
