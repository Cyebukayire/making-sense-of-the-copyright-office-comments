Hello! I&rsquo;m an illustrator, currently in my early career, who&rsquo;s worked on a variety of projects from books to games to television shows. The current trajectory of AI in creative fields has been a big source of anxiety for many creatives, myself included, in its intention to compete with artists. I have seen AI generated art that has plagiarized others in my field, the users directly referencing and feeding their databases with artwork from specific artists, so that they could generate more work in that artist&rsquo;s style, while claiming it as their own. And even when the reference is not so direct, many of our works have been mined and placed into databases without our consent or knowledge. <br/><br/>Art, from its creation to its aesthetics, is deeply rooted in the artist&rsquo;s perspective and understanding of the world. The way my art looks is influenced by the things I notice, the values I hold, my experiences throughout my life, and how I want to synthesize everything about me into a piece of work that can speak to someone else. The aesthetics of it is only one piece of the puzzle, but one that I have spent every day of my life developing over many years. For someone to reduce an artist&rsquo;s work down to just its visuals, is to overlook the qualities that make it shine, make it connect to others, qualities that are intangible and innate to the individual that can&rsquo;t just be copied and reproduced. I believe that if AI were to replace the same artists whose works are being used to train it, we&rsquo;ll see a decline in the quality of art, which is so much more than just being something nice to look at. <br/><br/>In addition, although what we&rsquo;ve been calling AI art is perhaps the biggest leap so far, I don&rsquo;t think machine-learning and algorithmically generated images is entirely new to the arts, at least not the digital arts. For example, Adobe Photoshop contains tools that essentially require the software to sample the image and generate a new piece of it using the data it&rsquo;s collected, often for small edits like removing a blemish from a photo. I think, although this is not quite the same as AI art, it is an instance where technology is developed to help artists. It&#39;s a tool that an artist can use by choice to work more quickly, rather than something that seeks to replace the artist and the process entirely. I think in moving forward with AI art, that&rsquo;s something to consider: whether these models will empower the artist in their work or whether they have the capacity to destroy an artist&rsquo;s livelihood. I believe for things to be shifted to the former, artwork used in training data sets must be consented to by the artist who created it and that work made from these models are non-commercial. <br/><br/>As AI art develops, another concern that arises is the ease of creating fake images and photographs. I believe to counter this, it must be required that AI generated images are labeled as such. In an era where misinformation is already starting to run rampant, we need to place restrictions on tools that would encourage it even more. <br/><br/>To summarize, I believe that to protect artists and their work the following conditions must be met: 1) Datasets should only contain works that are in the public domain or consented to by the artist who created the work. In the case of work-for-hire, it may be consented to by the copyright holder, but that possibility must be made clear and agreed to by the artist before the transfer of copyright. 2) Work produced by AI-models are non-commercial. 3) Work produced by AI must be labeled as such. I urge that the Office pass legislation that supports the work of artists and other creatives. Thank you for taking the time to read my comment!<br/>
