I am against AI art as it stands right now.  Currently all of the AI models (the art ones that I know of) have all taken images from the internet without consent, credit or compensation.  If I am not allowed to take an image from the internet that I don&rsquo;t own, without paying the owner or asking their permission I don&rsquo;t see why any other AI company can do so.  On top of that they are making money off of this theft.  <br/>Jobs have been lost with this already.  Disney has used AI in two of their major shows Loki and Secret Invasion.  A quick google search tells me that the Walt Disney Co is worth 147 billion dollars.  Could they not afford to pay someone to make the Loki ad poster or the Secret Invasion title sequence?  Instead, they paid to have a computer program do it for them.  A computer program that could not function or create the art it does without the theft of billions of images.<br/>I am not against technology but I am against theft.  This needs to be regulated and laws must be put in place.  Not for some future AI bogeyman that will learn to think for itself.  I&rsquo;m not afraid of that.  I&rsquo;m afraid of the jobs that will be lost because of a program that steals artwork and then directly competes with artists for jobs.  I&rsquo;m afraid of the violating retaliation from someone if they get mad at me and then take my image to make it seem like I&rsquo;ve done terrible things to smear my reputation.  I&rsquo;m afraid of miss information on the political landscape.  I&rsquo;m afraid of what is happening right now with AI while there are no regulations or rules in place. <br/>
