Thank you to the Copyright Office for opening these questions for public feedback. I am a visual artist whose living depends on selling my work. I think generative AI has the potential to be helpful to artists in creative industries, but currently the lack of legal framework surrounding it lends itself to vastly more harm than good. Artists across various industries have noted an impact to the work they are receiving, and AI image generators are pushing them out of their industry with things built off of their stolen copyrighted work (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3600211.3604681). There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time. While a work is under copyright, it should not be used without the artist&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI. To do so would violate the artist&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies. This is already an emerging issue for AI image generators. For example, Midjourney founder admitted that he did not seek consent for the use of hundreds of millions of images for generative AI training (https://petapixel.com/2022/12/21/midjourny-founder-admits-to-using-a-hundred-million-images-without-consent/). Additionally, in the case of proclaimed &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; generative AI such as Adobe Firefly, which states it is trained on Adobe Stock images and public domain content, stock artists have raised concerns with compensation and the lack of initial notification that their work would be used to train AI (https://venturebeat.com/ai/adobe-stock-creators-arent-happy-with-firefly-the-companys-commercially-safe-gen-ai-tool/). There is a need for clear and consistent guidelines revolving around copyright and generative AI. The Copyright Office should position itself firmly that training generative AI on copyrighted content without consent of the artist of those works is in violation of the Copyright Act. Thank you again for your time and consideration of these issues.
