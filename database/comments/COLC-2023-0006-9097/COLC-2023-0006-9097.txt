AI has been an important tool in the tech space to study metrics and understand audience behavioural needs. I am fully supportive of fostering innovation in the creative realm and advocating for the protection of artists, producers, and songwriters, especially with the rising number of questions related to intellectual property.<br/><br/>I&#39;m intrigued by the various ways AI has recently made a difference by innovating the creative process. Additionally, AI has shaped our way of thinking, making it easier for engineers and songwriters to create outstanding records that align with their creative visions. However, as AI continues to evolve, it could potentially enhance artist development in the digital realm and provide producers with a clearer direction as they leverage technology for more effective production.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it is important to implement policies that protect creatives based on the originality of their work, prevent plagiarism through the use of specific individuals&#39; voices, and establish a secure infrastructure for licensing creative works in a modern way (such as smart contracts) to ensure fair distribution of royalties.<br/><br/>These changes help to improve the clarity and flow of your perspective on generative AI and copyright within the context of the Recording Academy&#39;s advocacy.<br/>
