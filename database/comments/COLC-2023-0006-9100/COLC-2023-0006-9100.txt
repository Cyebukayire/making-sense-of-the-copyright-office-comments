I am a aspiring Artist. And I dont think an app, powered by hundreds of scraping that might or might not be illegal to be copyrightable.<br/>Again, I will admit that I dont know the legality of it. Yes I know that machine learning itself is technically legal. But what if the tech is potentially be used to rid most of artists of their job?This kind of thing has no precedent and all and has the potential to rid many people of their jobs at once. My solution is simply make any generated image uncopyrightable and thats it.
