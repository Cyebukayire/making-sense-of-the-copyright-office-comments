There is no need for AI work to be copyrighted or even protected. Period. It&#39;s a machine that generates a single product by taking ideas from different artists/creators, WITHOUT ANY UNIQUE INPUT OF IT&#39;S OWN, like a human is capable of. I have personally submitted my own work to the copyright office, with my own contribution, and to allow AI work to be protected under copyright would be a joke and a huge slap to the face to many creators like I who payed to have our work PROTECTED. Many of us DO NOT rely on a machine to create something unique of our own. Yes, we humans take inspiration from everything around us, but we still include something into a creation from our own beliefs, experiences and education. The Copyright office will lose its merit if AI is ever accepted.
