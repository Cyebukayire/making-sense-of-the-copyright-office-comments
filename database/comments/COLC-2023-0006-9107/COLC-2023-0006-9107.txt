Dear US Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am writing to offer my comments on the matter of Artificial Intelligence and Copyright as set forth in Docket No. 2023-18624. As an independent experimental artist, I have engaged extensively with AI tools, creating custom models trained on my own art to explore my aesthetic inclinations through these technological mediums (see included images). My intention is never to emulate or plagiarize the work of other contemporary artists but to delve into a novel artistic space. The points below reflect a holistic and progressive understanding of AI within the copyright framework:<br/><br/>1. Fair Use: The practice of training AI models and generating output from them is aptly understood within the existing fair use framework concerning copyright. This understanding encourages the development and application of AI technologies while respecting the legal boundaries set by copyright laws.<br/><br/>2. Copyright and Human Authorship: Copyright is reserved for works of human authorship. Hence, raw AI output, which lacks human intervention, should be considered outside the purview of copyright protections. However, when a de minimis transformation is imparted to AI-generated media by human actors, copyright protection should be afforded, recognizing the human creativity and expression involved.<br/><br/>3. Labor Market Concerns: The potential impact of AI on the labor market, especially concerning commercial artists, is a labor issue rather than a copyright issue. Addressing this concern through robust labor protections and organization in industries susceptible to AI displacement will foster a healthy adaptation to technological advancements.<br/><br/>4. Generative AI as a Tool: Generative AI is a tool, the use or misuse of which falls under the responsibility of the end-users. A well-structured framework that educates and governs end-user responsibility will help in mitigating potential misuses of this technology.<br/><br/>5. Personal Engagement with AI as an Artist: My experience as an artist leveraging AI tools exemplifies the potential for individual creative exploration that these technologies offer. They provide a unique avenue for artists to investigate their own aesthetic choices, extending the boundaries of what is artistically possible.<br/><br/>I believe these points contribute to a balanced and informed dialogue surrounding the interaction between AI and copyright, aiming for a resolution that honors the rights of creators, fosters innovation, and accommodates the realities of the labor market.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments. I am open to providing further insights or clarifications if deemed necessary.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Robert Paul<br/>
