I am writing you today in response to your call for comments on generative AI rules. My response is short and only focused on the main concern I have with generative AI as I only found out about the open comment period today. I am a working visual artist, and I rely on my career and skills to support myself. I unfortunately have found my own work in the datasets used to train generative AI machines without my consent or compensation. I, like many other artists, writers, photographers, and others have had our work stolen. Companies like ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc need to amass large amounts of creative works in order to create their generative AI machines. These machines would not exist without this stolen work. They are machines built of theft. They have stolen my labor and my intellectual ideas. It is hard to have conversations about when an AI generated work would be granted a copyright or not when the machine used to create it only exists because of copyright violations in the first place. The only ethical generative AI machines are those built upon opt-in only content. As none of the current generative AI companies have created their machines using opt-in content only, nothing created using the generative AI machines should be eligible for copyright. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
