AI art is sourced from works that the original artists and writers did not consent to be used for such purposes. So long as the methods of obtaining the images to train the AI are obtained through such unethical practices, then AI generated art will always be unethical and continue to hurt artists, robbing them of job opportunities and income. Given that AI merely copies and regurgitates what is fed into it in the form of data sets, any work generated by said AI would be the amalgam of hundreds of different artists&rsquo; works and would make no sense to apply copyright to an AI generated image.
