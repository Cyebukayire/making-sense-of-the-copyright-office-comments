The USA has immense power, and if regulation for AI were to happen, many parts of the world will follow suit.<br/><br/>I am a small artist in Canada, and I think it is integral for AI to be regulated through law. Artists are being exploited, losing their jobs and losing their passions. Art should not be corporate, as it&#39;s an expression of humanity and it&#39;s emotions, memories, and experiences, things a machine can never do. A machine cannot create a sketch and spent hours figuring out which arm position looks fundamentally the best in the composition. A machine cannot create art, for it is a machine. <br/><br/>AI generated images and content need to be regulated, from voice actors having their voices stolen to say racist, homophobic, and downright rude things; to actors being &quot;deepfaked&quot; for propaganda (this has been especially proven during the attack on Palestine and having actors generated to support Israel, which goes against their beliefs,) to these generators outright stealing private data, like medical records. It&#39;s insulting and extremely violating. <br/><br/>There needs to be regulation and there needs to be consequences to this. <br/><br/>AI generators should not cost money to use, they should be able to provide a list of all the artists it extracts from its data set, and those artists need to be compensated-- using their work without permission is copyright infringement in of itself. There&#39;s no permission, it&#39;s just stolen and we&#39;re left fending for ourselves. It&#39;s gotten to the point where these generators can replicate the signatures from certain artists because of how much they appear in those data sets. <br/><br/>This is just a desperate cry out trying to be listened to, in all honesty. I didn&#39;t spend years as a child dreaming of creating to be told someone writing prompts in a generator and getting an output in seconds is a dedicated artist; they are scabs more than anything. Thank you.
