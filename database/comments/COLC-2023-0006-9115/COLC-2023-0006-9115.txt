As a human being who has written for a living, I would like to add my small input to the issue of LLMs and GPT violating copyright law and abusing the concept of fair use. I hope the government will enact regulation to curb this, not because we fear the advance of technology but because we mistrust human exploitation. IBM executives once understood, &ldquo;A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management decision.&rdquo; Thank you for your consideration.
