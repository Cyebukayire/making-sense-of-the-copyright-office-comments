I am a practicing veterinarian with many years experience watching the rise of AI work with interest. I was rather stunned to see the casual plagiarism &amp; seeming piracy of the work of writers ( every genre), artists and actors under the guise of &quot;training&quot; AI units. No permission is requested, no payment is offered,  no seeming ethical boundary is observed.  What is not tolerated and is viewed as unethical between human artists, and scientists for that matter, (copying someone&#39;s work product without citing origin) cannot be tolerated in machines belonging to other humans, who can&#39;t/don&#39;t  generate art, generate written word, create unique portrayals of stories themselves, author an experiment etc,  yet plan to profit from the &quot;work&quot; of their machines, stolen from creators. In my view it is theft once removed. In my opinion, it is essential that regulation of this matter must include by necessity a) permission from the human originator of the work. b) a right of refusal, with a consequence for failing to respect a refusal [or the breadth of a refusal] c) a format for citing work used in the AI training and citing for any work beyond the training. d) a fixed term for the use with a known stop date. e) compensation scale for work used. f) a valid complaint process ( neutral). This may seem onerous, but is necessary to achieve from the outset. The regulations can be reviewed and amended by group debate. It is the only proper way to act decently. Skimming work from someone who trained to achieve it, have a talent others enjoy, who gave up other things to develop the work and who are earning a living for their family is abhorrent and anti-community.  Theft is not okay.  We are all the people of this world and we need to focus on appreciating, respecting and developing the humans who make it.
