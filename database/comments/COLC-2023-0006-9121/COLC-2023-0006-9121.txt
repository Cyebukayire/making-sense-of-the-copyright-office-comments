In summary, I implore the Copyright office to <br/><br/>A, not take any positions which may erode or undermine Fair Use for human artists, writers, etc, or to expand copyright protections.<br/><br/>B. that any positions taken by the office that Generative AI may constitute infringement ONLY be applicable to Generative AI creating brand new work by itself, not other forms of automated scraping or collection or using generative AI as a filter, upscaling tool, or otherwise as part of a larger workflow. <br/><br/>C: Take the position that AI generated works cannot receive Copyright protection.<br/><br/>D: Take the position that the mere unliscensed use of Copyrighted material for generative AI training should not constitute infringement, as arguably none of the original work is used or present in the resulting AI or it&#39;s output works. The AI should only br infringing for commercial uses  which also significantly threatens the employment of artists/their market value within the 4th fair use factor.<br/><br/>Here are my specific responses some of the Notice of Inquiry/Copyright Office AI Study Abbreviated Questions questions<br/><br/>1. I am concerned that AI may be used to displace artists, writers, etc by large Media corporations and employers, as well as being used for misinformation. I am also concerned that the fear around AI may lead to expansions to already overbroad Copyright law or to erode fair use. However, AI has also served as a useful tool as part of an artistic workflow to clean up or upscale images.<br/><br/>3. This paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13188 establishes that &quot;overfitting&quot; (where Generative AI produces output images identical or very similar to the inputs it was trained on) is rare, supporting the idea which Generative AI is not generally infringing. <br/><br/>5. Any new legislation should focus on improving the working conditions and employment rights of workers against being replaced with AI, NOT expansions to copyright protection or which would undermine or erode Fair Use.<br/><br/>7. My understanding is that generative AI (at least for images) is trained by examining thousands of images, each of which has attributes of what the image depicts labeled (EX: Ball, Pool, Car, etc). The AI program then examines the similarities and differences between the images to then &quot;learn&quot; image composition, lighting, and other artistic principals, which can generate new works based on specific prompts/tags, or can used to modify existing images. <br/><br/>7.2. As I understand it, images etc generative AI is trained on is NOT actually contained within the AI after it is trained. <br/><br/>7.4. Outside of rare instances of overfitting, no, it does not seem to be possible to identify a specific image was used in training data without knowing the training datasets, at least for image AI.<br/><br/>8. Almost all uses of unauthorized copyrighted material being used for AI training should be Fair Use for generative image AI, as none of the actual content from images is present in the AI algorithim after training or in the output images it generates, only &quot;descriptions&quot; or artistic principals gleaned from the images it was trained on. It is arguably not even a &quot;use&quot; or deriative to begin  with.<br/><br/>9.1. As AI arguably doesn&#39;t even make deriative use of the art it is trained on, it should usually be fair use and consent should not be required.<br/><br/>10.3: While I do not believe licensing/consent should nessacarily be required for AI training to begin with, I would support compulsory licensing if licensing is necessary.<br/><br/>10.5: As stated, while I do not think that most use of copyrighted material in training should require consent, and I think it should generally qualify for fair use, I especially think noncommercial use should.<br/><br/>18. No, AI generated works should not be copyrighted, and the Bar of Originality should be high enough that simply slightly modifying an AI generated work does not qualify it for copyright protection either.<br/><br/>20. No, the less restrictions and more transparency, the better. <br/><br/>22. No, as stated, AI training is so indirect as to where it should almost always be fair use and should arguably not even be considered derivative. <br/><br/>25. As previously stated, I do not believe AI generated materially should generally be infringing, but end users of the system ESPECIALLY should NOT be liable.<br/><br/>27. As stated, I do not believe AI generated material should generally be infringing, but if any laws, rulings, etc establish infringement or liability, it should EXCLUSIVELY apply to generative AI and should not create liability or erode fair use for human artists.<br/><br/>31. No, expanded publicity rights risk chilling speech and create liability to lawsuits in situations they shouldn&#39;t. See: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/broad-federal-publicity-right-risky-answer-generative-ai-problems<br/><br/>32. Absolutely NOT. Protections against mimicking artistic styles is far too vague and open to abuse, especially applied to human artists who could face legal action for having a similar style to another artist.
