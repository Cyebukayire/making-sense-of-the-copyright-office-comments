Allowing AI programs to collect copyrighted images and text into a database to be used to develop AI programs contradicts existing laws.<br/>-  Consider the fact that corporations are allowed to trademark colors. Certain colors are owned by corporations and are protected under law.<br/>- Consider that Monsanto is allowed to patent living seeds. And they are allowed to dictate how the resulting plants are used. Resulting in lawsuits against farmers for simply collecting seeds from their own plants.<br/>The only thing separating the above cases from the copyright case before you is the fact that artists don&rsquo;t have the lobbyists, lawyers, money and clout that these corporations have. Please do the right thing and do it quickly. Please set regulations to prevent AI from abusing copyright laws before we aren&rsquo;t able to put this genie back in its bottle. Thank you. <br/>
