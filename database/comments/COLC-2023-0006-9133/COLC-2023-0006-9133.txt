I&#39;m a musician who has seen how tech companies devalued music as mere content used so that they sell ads or subscriptions, often without any regard to protecting copyright. I&#39;m concerned that &quot;so-called&quot; artificial intelligence will be treated as something greater than it is: a very expensive auto complete program. There is no creativity in an algorithm that relies on having to train on existing art, just unexpected results that are chosen by an operator as being &quot;good enough&quot; to not have to pay an artist to create. Companies should not be allowed to use any art without the explicit consent of the artist, otherwise that is a clear violation of copyright if the company uses any part of the art as part of its output. Please help to protect the future artists, and the unique human expression that they will create.
