I&#39;m a former comic book editor who has worked for Marvel, DC Comics, and Image Comics. Comics are an incredibly labor-intensive, collaborative art form. A serial comic book usually requires a full team of professionals: writer, penciller, inker, colorist, and letterer. The team works together under the supervision of an editor to create a visual narrative using both words and images. It takes several weeks for this crew of professionals to produce the 20-page story that is standard for the industry.<br/><br/>Comics are an exceedingly difficult business to break into and just as difficult to sustain as a full-time career. (Check out the Twitter hashtag #comicsbrokeme for stories of how challenging the industry is.) It&#39;s ultra competitive and often newcomers to the business are not paid a liveable wage. Many rookie artists self publish or showcase their work for free online simply for exposure and to build an online portfolio. What can allow a newcomer to compete in such an intense environment is having a *unique visual style*. As an editor I was a hiring professional. I can say without question that an artist&#39;s style is one of the largest factors in whether they were hired for a book. <br/><br/>The rise of AI software such as Midjourney means that by typing in prompts *that specify the artist&#39;s name* one can generate an image that apes the style of said artist. And it does that because the AI has been trained on that artist&#39;s work without consent, credit, or compensation. That AI-generated image may not be eligible for copyright. But when an artist&#39;s unique visual style can be plagiarized this easily, it directly competes with their ability to control and monetize their work. If a top artist commands large fees, it&#39;s because they&#39;ve amassed a body of work over countless hours applying themselves to their craft. In short, they earned it. It&#39;s unconscionable that a less expensive AI-generated facsimile of an artist&#39;s work may replace the actual artist, but that&#39;s the reality we&#39;re now living in. <br/><br/>It&#39;s not just the most in-demand artists who are affected. As I said, comics are a brutal industry. Plenty of artists pay their bills by supplemental means, through art commissions, or by applying their art to merchandise they can sell direct to consumers. Generative AI is a menace to these artists as well. <br/><br/>It&#39;s worth noting that there are no labor unions for comic book artists and writers. Protections against AI was one of the core issues at the heart of the 148-day Hollywood writers strike. It&#39;s also one of the key issues for the ongoing Screen Actors Guild strike. Generative AI is no less an existential threat to the comics industry.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.
