1. As described above, generative AI systems have the ability to produce material that would be copyrightable if it were created by a human author. What are your views on the potential benefits and risks of this technology? How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, technology developers, researchers, and the public?<br/><br/>Said ability is possible thanks to unapologetically feeding an algorithm with uncompensated working class&#39; properties. That&#39;s not an achievement but a grift, it should not be compensated with copyright because it didn&#39;t respect creatives&#39; rights to begin with.<br/>The benefits are not in the creative industry. Even the niche, theoretical benefits, implies an already trained model with text, images, music, or whatever. These outputs, even if made with authorized properties with hard to read contracts or standardized and forced royalties made by mega comporations, will still damage an already fractured power dynamic in the industry. People already get uncredited and robbed all the time, if genAI is involved and validated by being able to hold copyrights, then people will stop being &quot;chief character designer&quot; so to speak and become &quot;AI assistant of this or that&quot; and therefore end up being exploited even more.<br/>If genAI outputs are validated then workers, not CEOs nor executives, will lose power as a whole because a software can do their work for pretty much free. The software it&#39;s been fed with their work to make them compete with themselves and their peers, the ones losing more are the workers, not the companies. So if it&#39;s not made by humans it should not have value nor protections, and because it&#39;s impossible to prove what is human or AI all the time, then it&#39;s not possible to enforce certain guidelines looking for a middle ground.<br/><br/>2. Does the increasing use or distribution of AI-generated material raise any unique issues for your sector or industry as compared to other copyright stakeholders?<br/><br/>Any market can and *is* being flooded with cheep worthless genAI as we speak, devaluing humans and the market itself. If someone decide *not* to use genAI, that person will be drown in an infinite sea of genAI trash, but if they decide to use genAI to stay competitive, they will contribute to that infinite sea of trash and end up in the same place: nowhere, because the market has no value and it&#39;s impossible to be discovered.<br/>These markets belongs to humans, there&#39;s no middle ground. GenAI is no tool, it&#39;s a race to the bottom.<br/><br/>3. Please identify any papers or studies that you believe are relevant to this Notice. These may address, for example, the economic effects of generative AI on the creative industries or how different licensing regimes do or could operate to remunerate copyright owners and/or creators for the use of their works in training AI models. The Office requests that commenters provide a hyperlink to the identified papers.<br/><br/>Any paper that treats genAI as what it is it&#39;s a good paper: a *software* made to circumvent laws and, in this case, creatives&#39; rights to make bank (case in point: attachment named ZZS (124), a chat between Midjourney users).<br/>I&#39;ll link to a website putting up some papers in a second, there&#39;s this one in the meantime: AI Art and its Impact on Artists https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604681 (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3600211.3604681)<br/><br/>Unfortunately I didn&#39;t get the memo about the USCO looking for comments until pretty late so I wasn&#39;t prepare to comment in all the questions in time, but I know someone who did. This website https://luddite.pro/public-submission-for-usco-generative-ai-call-for-comment/ have a long and detailed response for all the questions, including the third one asking for papers. Although there&#39;s few clashing ideas between the author and me, at the end of the day we want the same goal: protect humans and their rights of this grift disguise as progress. We can&#39;t treat an algorithm as a human by giving it protections while crippling and harming actual humans.
