I am against the use of AI image generators as a way to speed up any part of the illustration process if the images used to train said generators were used without the artists&#39; permission (barring those already deceased). Using said generators for personal consumption - that is, for images not posted publicly and not to be used in portfolios - is something I&#39;m okay with, however. I do not also support AI generated images being eligible for any sort of copyright because even if a human thought of what prompts to use, there is nothing to base copyright on.
