Literary and Visual Arts Works<br/><br/>Attribution<br/><br/>AI-created work technically does not require attribution, let alone compensation, since it does not have copyright protection. This means that anyone can use, post, sell or give away any person&rsquo;s AI-created or AI-human created work without attribution and possible compensation, no matter the creative, originality or personal connection the person may have with the work, seemingly in many or most cases. If the US Copyright Office (USCO) won&rsquo;t give such work copyright recognition, why should anyone else? Perhaps this is part of Jason Allen&rsquo;s &ldquo;void of ownership troubling to creators&rdquo; argument that the USCO so flatly rejected in its September 2023 &ldquo;Th&eacute;&acirc;tre D&rsquo;op&eacute;ra Spatial&rdquo; (second request) decision (at 7-8). <br/><br/>Ideas and Prompts<br/><br/>I would argue that if a person has an idea and creates a prompt to try and realize that idea through AI generation, then the person&rsquo;s resulting work should get at least partial copyright protection since the work would not even exist if not for the person&rsquo;s idea, corresponding prompt and subsequent prompting. <br/><br/>The idea itself would not be copyrighted, keeping with current USCO practice (USCO Compendium, 2021, 701). The prompt itself may or may not be copyrighted since the USCO has said some prompts might be copyrightable if they were &ldquo;sufficiently creative to be independently protected by copyright&rdquo; (Th&eacute;&acirc;tre D&rsquo;op&eacute;ra Spatial Decision (second request) (2023), at 6, footnote 8). But even if the prompt was not copyrightable, this should not disqualify the person&rsquo;s work from getting at least some sort of copyright because the uncopyrightable prompt would simply not be claimed. <br/><br/>So since the idea is not being claimed, and since the prompt is either being claimed if it is copyrightable or is not being claimed if it is not, then the resulting work should be able to be at least partially claimed since it has at least the &ldquo;modicum of creativity&rdquo; needed to qualify for protection (Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service, 499 US 340, 1991, at 346). How could a person&rsquo;s conscious actions without which the work would not have been created not be considered at minimum a modicum of creativity? It seems that it should, almost by definition, be considered to be an act of creativity. <br/><br/>Economy<br/><br/>It is important that the economic contributions that professional writers, publishers and artists may make to the economy do not influence the copyright laws working for their benefit over the benefit of the newly emerging AI-assisted authors. <br/><br/>I sometimes feel that these economic interests can be seen in laws such as the extremely lengthy 95-year copyright protection that commercial creators, even those that have passed, have been given by Congress. <br/><br/>Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken (1975) says &ldquo;fair return&rdquo; and &ldquo;adequate return&rdquo; in regards to copyright, but the lengthy copyright protection given commercial creators far exceeds &ldquo;fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and speaks more to such terms as &ldquo;maximize.&rdquo; I hope that any AI regulations will not go in this maximizing direction.<br/><br/>The 2021 USCO Compendium, 309.1, says that the USCO won&rsquo;t consider the marketability or commercial success when examining AI work for copyright protection. This seems to support the position that copyright laws shouldn&rsquo;t favor commercially successful creators when considering issues concerning AI.<br/><br/>Along the same lines, protecting writers&rsquo; jobs, while important, should not overly influence AI copyright laws or decisions.<br/><br/>Congress<br/><br/>In a 2022 letter, Senators Tillis and Coons asked the USCO and US Trademarks and Patents Office to create a national AI commission that could perform tasks including &ldquo;creating new forms of protections, like sui generis rights, or other measures the commission may think appropriate.&rdquo; Some form of copyright protection for AI-created or AI-human-created works should be one of these new forms whether it comes from the commission, Congress, the courts, or some other source.<br/><br/>Non-Professional Users<br/><br/>Future USCO literary listening sessions need a more general representative for non-professional users of AI. Though the fan fiction representative made some very good points, fan fiction is too narrow a category and may give the impression that non-professional AI users do not have the ability to write anything beyond works based on popular commercial content.<br/><br/>Young people who may be growing up using creative AI, or an expert on such young people, should also be included in future panels to see how young people are reacting to and being influenced by such technology. I believe Jule Sigall of Microsoft and Rachel Brooke of the Authors Alliance made somewhat similar, general points during the USCO&rsquo;s April 19, 2023 literary listening session. <br/><br/>
