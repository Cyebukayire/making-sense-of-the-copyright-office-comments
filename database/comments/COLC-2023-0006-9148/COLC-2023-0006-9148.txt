<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>AI is a tool, however, with the rate at which it is expanding, unregulated, criminals are being emboldened to destroy the rights of everyone. AI&rsquo;s most prominent uses are to steal from creatives, spread misinformation, and hold society back. Due to these problems, harsh rules need to be put in place quickly, before companies use the indifference to sneak these crimes under the radar. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>When people create a new thing, their work is protected, they have the rights of the thing they made. Most people using AI do not seem to understand that. The machines are stealing from the entire internet. When artists state they do not give permission for their work to be fed into the machine, bad players will retaliate by feeding their work in anyway, which is an active rights violation. (Marikyuun) As you know, &ldquo;Under the current law, works created on or after January 1, 1978, have a copyright term of life of the author plus seventy years after the author&rsquo;s death.&rdquo; (Copyright.gov) One artist died, and their work was fed into the machine the next day. (Kim Jung Gi) There is so much work that has no right being in the machines, that the only proper way to deal with them is to shut them all down. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Have you ever done something creative? Chances are you at least tried something. We as humans have the urge, to pluck piano keys, to pick up a pencil and write words or draw, to open our mouths and let lyrics pour out. Part of the process is trial and error. It is about making mistakes and learning from them. It&rsquo;s about being inspired from others&rsquo; works and putting your own twist on it to make it new. It&rsquo;s about seeing the world around you and drawing from life and conveying your emotions and experiences. AI tools are simply copying and pasting the output of these journeys and mashing them together. They don&rsquo;t understand these journeys, and neither do the people trying to use AI. There&rsquo;s this idea that artists are &ldquo;talented&rdquo;, it is used to undermine the effort and practice put in to improve our creating skills. This idea emboldens thieves to loudly declare themselves artists without actually understanding the skills. They simply steal and think it&rsquo;s justified.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>There is also the use of AI to spread lies and misinformation. A young woman&rsquo;s life was ruined when people generated naked images of her using AI and spread them around. (Rachel) This indicates a future where minority voices are taken away because evidence can be faked. Fake images were also spread as propaganda to tell stories of things that didn&rsquo;t actually happen. (Israel-Hamas) The more that can be faked, the harder it is to understand the truth and the more divided we as people will be. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We need to do better and protect our human rights. We cannot let people use machines to take away the rights of our fellow humans. We need strict guidelines and rules that are enforced to keep us safe. Without them, work and voices will continue to be stolen at a rapid pace. <br/><br/>Marikyuun, https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OXqWuHhGPRM<br/>Copyright.gov, https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/<br/>Kim Jung Gi, https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/kim-jung-gi-death-stable-diffusion-artificial-intelligence-1234649787/ <br/>Rachel, https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=e87MgtpY-tk <br/>Israel-Hamas,  https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/israel-hamas-misinformation-fueled-ai-images-1234863586/ <br/><br/>
