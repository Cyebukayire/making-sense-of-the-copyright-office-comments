AI &quot;art&quot; is an insult to every artist out there that has spent dedication and time to perfect their craft- not to mention the thousands of artists that attended school to better themselves. It&#39;s incredibly frustrating that to share our work, either for just fulfilment or for work purposes, we have to jump through hoops to protect ourselves, like using programs like Glaze and Nightshade. If you&#39;d like to protect art integrity and our livelihoods, please regulate ai art and prevent art theft to fuel their data sets.
