I have worked professionally as an illustrator since 2014, but I have worked to consistently develop my artistic skills for the majority of my life, nearly 30 years. I attended the Savannah College of Art and Design for six years and graduated with a BFA in Sequential Art. <br/><br/>Question #1: As a working visual artist, I am deeply concerned about the risks this technology poses to the future of careers in the visual arts. Those of us who work in the visual arts have spent years, if not most of our lives, studying and gaining a deep understanding of subjects such as anatomy, composition, perspective, lighting, and color theory. Many of us have spent thousands of dollars on rigorous training and education at artistic universities. We post our work on social media and on our own websites as a means of attracting new clients and networking with other artists. It is unethical for this work to be taken without our knowledge or consent to train AI models. Artists deserve control over the work they create and the ways in which it is used, especially when it is used in the generation of a product that might provide a source of income.<br/><br/>AI models being trained on our work allow others to profit from the labor, time, and money we have spent building skills strong enough to compete in our own industries and earn income. AI is already being used to generate work that human artists would have traditionally been hired to create. For example, programs such as Dall-E are widely boasted about for their ability to generate book covers in minimal time and at minimal cost. This reduces the potential opportunities for artists to earn income on the crafts they&rsquo;ve trained for, and the effect is more devastating if the databases used by these models were built on our work without our consent. It is unethical for our own labor to be weaponized against us and used to generate output that competes with us and pushes us out of our own fields. Prompting and selecting materials to be used in the generation of AI output is in no way comparable to the years of study and practice used to create the works that the output is based on in the first place. <br/><br/>At the absolute minimum, AI developers and creators should be required to clearly and concisely ask artists for consent before using artwork to train their databases. Opt-IN should be the standard. Not opt-out. The onus of consent should not be placed on the person whose work is being taken advantage of. I did not spend years of hard labor to beg someone else not to use my work without my consent. Generous and adequate compensation should be offered to any artists who agree to opt-in. Consent and compensation are not unreasonable demands. They should be the ethical bare minimum and the foundation upon which this technology advances from here on out.<br/><br/>I have personally already experienced a severe loss of income in a non-artistic job due to the increased use of AI. My years of work and input at that job were used to train the company&rsquo;s model which ultimately pushed me out of a source of financial stability. It is disheartening to see it happening in artistic fields too. Internet searches yield numerous accounts of the mental and emotional impacts this technology has had on artists in regards to the exploitation of our work. Many artists are expressing a sense of hopelessness, severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, and, in some cases, suicidal ideation or intent. It is unethical for our hard work to be used in ways that push us out of our own fields. This technology should, at the very least, be regulated to allow us control over our own copyrighted works and the ways in which they are used, and to allow us to continue to compete in the fields that we&#39;ve trained and labored for. Developers must be made to clearly and concisely ask for consent to use copyrighted materials in their datasets and to use opt-IN instead of opt-out methods. <br/><br/>Question #3: Here is a link to a paper relevant to the impact of AI on artistic careers, including copyright issues: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3600211.3604681<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
