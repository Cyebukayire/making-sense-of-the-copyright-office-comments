  <br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>My personal opinion is that any potential benefits of generative AI are outnumbered by the risks.  Realistic fakes and factual errors resulting from AI will impede all types of research (https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/author-discovers-ai-generated-counterfeit-books-written-in-her-name-on-amazon/).  Similarly, an author discovered several AI-generated books falsely baring her name on both Amazon.com and Goodreads.com. <br/>Two men have used an algorithm to generate what they claim ate all possible musical melodies (http://allthemusic.info/).  They claim to have copyrighted the melodies and released them into the public domain.  If their claim is valid (and if they are allowed to release a work into the public domain), this would be grossly unfair to artists who can&rsquo;t compose lyrics as well as they can create instrumental music (especially musicians with disabilities).  Artists who create lyrics would have some level of copyright protection, but those creating instrumentals would not.  It would also be unfair to artists if the pair had chosen to both claim and hold copyright on the melodies.  I propose that AI-generated works both retain their inability to be copyrighted and also not be considered as published works in the public domain.  <br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I believe the following papers would be relevant to this Notice:<br/><br/>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493v2  - AI trained on works generated by AI degrades with each iteration.  To stay viable, new sources of works must be obtained.  I believe this means a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; system trained on AI generated and public domain works would not be possible.  <br/><br/>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13771.pdf - Although this paper is hasn&rsquo;t completed the review process, the fact the LLM was able to reproduce sections of copyrighted material without authorization from the copyright holder is troubling.  <br/><br/>5.  New legislation is absolutely warranted to address all issues that generative AI raises in regard to copyright.  It should make clear that AI-generated works aren&rsquo;t eligible for copyright protection, in addition to providing a standard for a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;right of publicity&rdquo; so that both the average person and public figures are entitled to a fair minimum damage and so that attorneys don&rsquo;t have to navigate a maze of state laws on a case-by-case basis.  Clarification would be needed so that users of AI-generated works would not generate non-parodic works featuring copyrighted character and use them as &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; substitutes for authorized images.  <br/><br/>7.1 Please see the paper provided in my answer to question<br/><br/>9.  Yes, copyright owners should have to affirmatively consent, or &ldquo;opt in&rdquo;, to the use of their works for training materials.<br/>
