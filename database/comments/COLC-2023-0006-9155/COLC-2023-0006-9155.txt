I am a 3D artist and I have the feeling that there is no longer any point in inventing new things or evolving my style if it is to be stolen so easily. If the more I work, the more I feed an AI. If by users who can use my style, I compete against hundreds of versions of myself.<br/><br/>Unfair competition is not the only reason that demotivates me but also the trauma of seeing my style stolen.<br/>My style does not only come from the artists who inspired me, but also from my personal experience, my joys, my traumas. And also my psychomotricity. (We all learn to write the same way, but we end up having our own handwriting. For illustrators, it&#39;s even deeper).<br/><br/>I think that AI may perhaps stop the evolution of art.<br/>We very well recognize the art of the 20s or 50s or 90s. Now if I imagine that AI had been available in the 50s in the same way as today, I think that the great artists would have refrained from offer their personality, their unique style or voice to the world for fear of being stolen.<br/>What great artist would not have existed?<br/><br/>Because of all these depressing issues, I&#39;m working on reorienting myself to do more artisanal work.<br/>But AI with 3D has improved and with a single photo of one of my products the AI can generate a 3D model that can be printed with a 3D printer.<br/>Also, I wanted to make videos to present my work and help me attract potential clients, but I am afraid that my image and my voice will be used to make me say bad things.<br/><br/>As a customer, when I see a product that interests me, I no longer have the patience to wonder if it&#39;s an AI photo showing a fake handmade lamp, or an AI-generated novel, or if this book about edible mushrooms is safe.<br/>I think it&#39;s damaging to independent artists.<br/><br/>These problems existed before, but AI has made counterfeits super accessible and easy to do.<br/><br/>I think that a solution that would satisfy everyone could perhaps be to block the AIs on a single style or several recognizable styles: a hyper-realistic one, a Disney-ish one for example. That way, seeing this style, we could immediately know that it&rsquo;s AI, and the artists would have room to stand out thanks to their style.<br/>And/Or force browsers to display on each image a small color dot which means: 100% AI, some AI parts, 100% human.<br/><br/>I think that artists&#39; works should be protected even when they do not own the copyright (like when they have signed for a work), because otherwise, artists will be afraid to sign for a work.<br/><br/>I think that all countries must agree on the same rules, as a lot of things happen via the internet, but the United States has enough weight to lead the movement.
