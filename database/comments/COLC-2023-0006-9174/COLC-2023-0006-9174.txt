AI is bad for artists and creatives, it replicates the work, many times without transforming it at all. i&rsquo;ve had my art used to teach a few different AI generators against my will and they&rsquo;ve created 1:1 reproductions of my art, with nothing changed at all. it&rsquo;s predatory and should be regulated.
