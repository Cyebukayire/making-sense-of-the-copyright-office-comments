I feel the main issue of all this is the disregard of the work that is stolen to make these processes work. In no way could any of these so called &quot;ai&quot; models ever function without the scraping of non consenting artists work whether it is via written word, drawings or their own voice or images. <br/><br/>I am of the opinion that allowing any form of ai work to be copy writable , even those that may have had a human hand in the work, will allow for companies to actively bypass the hard work of creators as we&#39;ve already seen trying to be implemented in the current strikes with the writers guild being offered jobs to edit chat gpt created scripts. <br/><br/>I do not see them ever ethically sourcing their media to create these data sets and with the vastness of which they can steal and store any chance of checking the entirety of the content for stolen work would be too enormous for anyone to ever truly verify.<br/><br/>At the end of the day companies will continue to try and undermine and steal whatever they can get away with as long as the fines and fees are less than the profit they will accrue. Me and My friends who create works of art need you to be there and to prevent this travesty from destroying our ways of life. The ripping of our words, our art our literal voices from us to be used in a machine that is neither intelligent nor sentient. It itself only functions due to the labor of overseas workers forced to clear and adjust things as it goes. <br/><br/>Please do the right thing and the Humane thing and prevent this &quot;ai&quot; in name only from being used as another falsehood and shield to steal the work of people <br/><br/>
