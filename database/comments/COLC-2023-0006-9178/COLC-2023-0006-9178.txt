As has been the current regulatory consensus, I believe that AI generated content should under no circumstances be granted copyright protections. As an independent digital artist and writer, I have directly witnessed the utilization of AI generated image systems to have a dramatic negative impact. Content generated by these systems pervade online spaces that otherwise might act as a platform to distribute my work, overshadowing the work of human artists with high volumes of low quality, generatively produced content that has a significant chilling effect on the work of independent creatives.<br/><br/>Furthermore, at the root of all current systems in the field of AI generated images is the issue of intellectual property violations, as the models powering these systems have been trained via indiscriminately harvested online data, collected with no regard or respect for the intellectual property of the original creators. These training datasets often contain billions of images, which are not reviewed in any substantive fashion before use in training AI models, resulting in all current major AI image generator systems exclusively functioning due in large part to making widespread and commonly commercialized use of many millions, if not billions of pieces of otherwise protected intellectual property belonging to individuals and businesses protected under US and international copyright law.<br/><br/>It is my strong belief that AI generated content must not be granted copyright protections in order to safeguard the fundamental role of human creativity in our society and economy. Furthermore, I believe in and strongly support the stringent regulation to safeguard the role of intellectual property rights in relation to the training of AI models. Generative software being trained using any protected intellectual property must be fully barred from any and all commercial use, and the full review and verification of intellectual property rights for all training data used when training AI models must be mandated before any such training is allowed to take place. Without prompt and firm safeguards to the intellectual property rights of human creators, I fear and believe that generative AI systems may lead to a significant chilling effect both in our society and economy in regards to creativity and the role of skilled creative labor. If the value of human creative output is not reaffirmed and codified in light of these new developments in technology, it is entirely conceivable, if not directly likely that many professional artists may be replaced by inferior generative AI systems that were trained using the work of the very artists they are displacing, trading the temporary benefit of low-cost machine generated output in the market for a catastrophic impact on the role of creative works in both our economy and society at large.<br/><br/>In summary, I strongly urge all applicable regulators and regulatory bodies to continue the current standard of denying AI generated content copyright protections, and furthermore to pursue regulatory action that safeguards and promotes the vital role of human creativity as an economic and societal cornerstone of our nation.
