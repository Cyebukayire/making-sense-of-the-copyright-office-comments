AI is copyright theft and is an abuse of artist rights. furthermore, the intention of copyright has been perverted by corporations, to repress artist rights. streaming deserves to be compensated. satirical or non-commercial application of art is free use but artists deserve to be compensated when their art is used for profit. furthermore, copyright is inferred upon the creation of any original work regardless of filing. any public claiming of work is also considered copy written, however, unattributed homage can be difficult to parse. thank you for your hard work. free-speech is the cornerstone of our democracy.
