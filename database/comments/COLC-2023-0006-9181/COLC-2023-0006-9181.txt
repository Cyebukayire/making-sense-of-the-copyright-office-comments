Hello U.S. Copyright Office, <br/><br/>As an author, please do not allow individuals to use AI or GPT to gain copyright status. Writing books using human creativity, putting words on a page or digital screen is part of the essences that makes us human. If we allow individuals to use other&#39;s art embedded in AI then it&#39;s not really art or creative work as it words taken from others. The difference with AI is that it is scrapping all our data and we have no way to protect our incomes or work. Protecting human creativity is the bedrock of our society. If we do not make a stand against the encroachment of these companies the very essence of human creativity will be lost. Also, when we allow AI to be consider as creative work the real art is massively devalued. As an author, this more than protecting my art this about protecting humanity, human art and creativity. Also, if a person is unable to write a book without the aid of AI write the words for them, then they should be writing a book or song in the beginning. Individuals who use AI - the words of others are taking the easy way to create art. Creativity and art comes from the soul. Should we, authors, musicians, and artist, lose the ability to protect our human created art, art as we know will disappear. None of the artist, musicians, and fellow authors I know use GPT for their art nor do they have any interest in doing so. <br/><br/>Thank you for listening. <br/><br/>Thank you to everyone at the U.S. Copyright Office for standing with artists. You are our only hope of protecting human creativity and human created art.
