The current artificial intelligence models were built by scraping a wide array of data from the internet which involves taking copyrighted work. On that basis alone, any current output of work should not be able to be copyrighted.<br/><br/>Additionally, in the case where a company might own the work to be fed into the model, such as with movies, you would be talking about ignoring the individual work that each player put into the piece and their owed monetary/benefits compensation when that work would then be actively used to create more profit. If you have 20 actors in a movie and some are deceased, it would be ignoring money owed to estates. <br/><br/>There is a clear difference between AI used to detail the mathematical models for certain things (such as tracking a one-shot for a director so that frames are more easily spliced or AI used to hasten pharmacological research when Phase trials would still be necessary) and things which are essentially COPYing work into a mish-mash and sometimes not a mish-mash at all. <br/><br/>Additionally, there are other issues. There should be clear rules regarding AI, copyright, and transformative works. Either AI changes things enough so that things are considered transformative and would be under Fair Use or it does not change things enough and therefore copyright should still be intact. People shouldn&#39;t have to live in limbo.
