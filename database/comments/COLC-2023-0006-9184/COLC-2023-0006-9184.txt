AI is corrupt and was built on the original, copyrighted works of millions of artists around the world, from painters, to writers, and even to voice actors. To use AI models (even those which say they have been trained on &ldquo;private datasets&rdquo;) is blatant theft and the antithesis of creativity. As an artist myself, the sudden AI boom is very concerning to me and my livelihood and the livelihoods of my friends. AI needs to be heavily regulated so that companies and individuals cannot profit from the work of actual artists who deserve to be paid for their own work. If companies are able to use AI, for profit, in its current form, all known forms of media will suffer from the low quality output of these machines. And of course, millions  of US jobs will be lost, much in the same way American labor has been put offshore by greedy companies looking to cut expenditures. Allowing this unregulated and new software any sort of leeway in the world is a mistake. I honestly think we need to just ban AI outright as it is being used for all kinds of insidious means, such as deepfakes of real women being exploited by AI as it places them in sexually explicit content against their will. This has also been done with politicians, in which their voices and faces are made to say controversial and false statements. I believe AI is a threat to global and US security on all fronts and it should be stopped.
