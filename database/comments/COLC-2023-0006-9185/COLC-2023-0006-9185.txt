As a voice over actor, I have serious concerns over the rise of Artificial Intelligence and Generative A.I. Studios are blatantly stating that they want to use AI generated content to replace humans. For them it will be cheaper to use going forward however using our likenesses, whether that is done to replace our voices and/or our actual likeness, is clearly an invasion of privacy and a form of piracy. <br/><br/>We cannot live in a world where someone else can do what ever they want with our personal attributes, leaving us with zero say in how it&#39;s used. For example using my voice for a promotional advertisement that I would not choose to do, for religious, social or any other reason, is wrong to the highest order. It is basically theft, and theft of the most private and personal of factors; who we are. <br/><br/>While it&#39;s an advancement in technology and has many helpful applications, taking our persona, voice and/or likeness, away from us is criminal. <br/><br/>I sincerely encourage you to implement the strongest restrictions on the use of AI when it comes to taking away our personal identities.
