AI needs heavy regulation. Presently between companies trying to cut out creatives by trying to force them to allow them to use their voices to create AI, and all of the rampant AI art generation misuse that trains their models on copyrighted works without prior authorization, a large number of creatives and creative fields are in danger if proper regulation is not enforced. People should not be able to make a profit off of other people&#39;s creative efforts through coercion or entirely without consent.<br/>Presently there are multiple AI generative websites that charge fees to use where their models are trained off of stolen work with no concern to the artists they&#39;re using as a profit. There are many creatives who&#39;s livelihoods have been threatened with this development in immoral AI and even more people who are being scammed by people who are using AI generation immorally to trick people into giving them funds in exchange for promises of work they can&#39;t actually render.
