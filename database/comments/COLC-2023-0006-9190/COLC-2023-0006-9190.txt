One of my biggest issues with Artificial Intelligence is in the name. The name suggests a degree of autonomy and creativity that these language learning models and diffusion art systems simply do not have. We are being sold hype about systems that are little more than extremely advanced forms of autocorrect. When I&#39;m writing a text, the autocorrect features frustrate me to no end, because they are constantly suggesting words that other people type in a similar context, and not the words that I want to use. We are being told to treat this technology like a character from a science fiction movie.<br/><br/>But my larger concern is this technology&#39;s massive impact on multiple industries, including my own. I am a technical writer and editor, and I work on creative projects with friends and on my own. While I can&#39;t make a direct connection between the two, I was part of a company-wide layoff shortly after becoming a vocal critic of some AI projects that had picked up steam. But more definitively, I am already hearing horror stories from translators, coders, artists, and short story publishers, about Artificially-written stories being presented to these professionals for &quot;clean up&quot;, only for them to spend considerably more time fixing the errors that these Language Learning Models and Art Generators do not understand they are making. Typically while being asked to &quot;fix&quot; it for less money than doing it from scratch. My concern here is summarized with a saying I&#39;ve repeated often, &quot;Why pay a human to do it well when you could have a computer do it badly for free?&quot;<br/><br/>There are multiple real-world examples here. The most famous one right now might be related to the Screen Actor&#39;s Guild strike, where movie studios were planning to pay background actors a day rate one time, to scan and use their faces in perpetuity in future films using AI. Science Fiction magazine Lightspeed was force to close its submission program for about a month, while they dealt with an extreme influx of badly written short stories by AI; meaning that human short story authors were unable to submit their work for pay in that period. I have also read about translators losing work to AI translation algorithms, and then being asked to edit those translations--riddled with errors and poorly parsed nuance--for considerably less pay.<br/><br/>Possibly the most terrifying example I&#39;ve seen of AI-generated content in the wild is the recent phenomenon of self-published, AI-written books about mushroom foraging. These books are credited to non-existent PhD doctors, and generated with absolutely no mechanism to fact check whether the mushrooms in question are actually edible. These books are currently being sold on Amazon, aimed at beginners who do not know how to identify whether a mushroom is actually poisonous.<br/><br/>As a society, we could be putting time and technology into solving actual labor problems. We could be finding ways to use computers to automate mundane tasks, to free workers to put effort into larger and more complex problems in their industries. However, all of the AI-powered tools I&#39;ve seen seem designed to appeal to business owners who view creative work as unnecessary and frivolous, rather than to the actual creative professionals who they&#39;re designed to replace.
