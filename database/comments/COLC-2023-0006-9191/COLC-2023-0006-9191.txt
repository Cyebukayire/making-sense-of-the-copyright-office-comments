As an artist who certainly sees the value of ai generated art and other media, I believe what the value of these tools showcases more than anything is the importance of the media these AI are learning from. Above all else, the autonomy and copyright of the original works in the training data sets must be respected, and if these machines cannot exist in any useful capacity without infringing on the rights or intent of those who put the time, effort and work into the works they copy, then they do not have the right to exist in the first place.
