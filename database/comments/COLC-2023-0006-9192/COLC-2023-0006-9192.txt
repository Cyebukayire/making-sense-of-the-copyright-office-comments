Hi, I&#39;m a student and freelance illustrator. The last year has been hell due to AI threatening the existence of human involvement in art. Watching my favorite artists being artificially replicated against their will brought me into the sphere of copyright and learning about AI, to understand the threat. I have grown increasingly concerned about the future not just of our jobs as artists, but also of human culture plateauing due to the lack of incentive to learn the difficult skills and crafts of art, as opposed to using an AI program that just mimics them. Though as I have learned, the AI models will always be restricted to variations of what is in the training data, and this is where the issue of copyright becomes a good front to fight what AI companies hope to do to art. I do not want art to be handed over to machines that have no reason to create, and I want people to be encouraged to learn the awesome skills that exist within the art space, to make truly unique and innovative art. I will now answer the questions provided.<br/><br/>1. I find this to be an extreme risk to the creative industry. There would be no need to &quot;buy&quot; art, if you could just have an AI model look at a bunch and recreate it for you based on your prompt. Copyright owners have been completely stripped of their rights in regard to being put into training datasets against their consent. Some companies offer an &quot;opt-out&quot;, which is to say they break the law and then put it onto the affected to come to them to fix it. People are using AI models instead of commissioning artists, leading to even greater hardship for creatives than before. Even companies are beginning to do this, as you can tell by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes trying to fight back against that. Though when it comes to companies, many times they will use contracts to &quot;legalize&quot; what they are doing. I, and the vast majority of creatives, see this as an ultimatum. We either give up our rights and let our work be added to AI models that will eventually replace us as we keep working, or we don&#39;t sign that contract, and someone else does. Either way, we will lose that job over time if someone decides to take it, and let their work become training data. Damned if you do damned if you don&#39;t.<br/><br/>2. As a visual artist I have been adding AI terms to my contracts. As stated above, not doing so could leave me open to being trained on, and having my work used to train image generating AI. Additionally, looking for reference as a visual artist is growing impossible due to the vast amount of AI generated slop filling the internet. Words like &quot;steampunk&quot; become meaningless when you google search and find awkward impossible mashes of something that could resemble machinery. I have seen impersonation accounts pop up that imitate small artists, using their work to train an image generating AI and output images that resemble them. It is hard to fight it when the output isn&#39;t traceably the same, but &quot;looks&quot; the same. It feels like identity theft that is not DMCA-able.<br/><br/>3. An article regarding one of the bleakest futures we will be seeing if something is not done regarding AI. Larger streaming companies want to hire writers to &quot;tweak&quot; Ai generated text until it is copyrightable from human input. This will happen to visual artists as well. We will be taken out of the art and made into a cleanup crew, where our skills are put to waste and we have no ability to improve and learn on the job, or add our own voices: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/amptp-ai-writers-guild-strike-1235573351/<br/><br/>4. The UK has suggested a &quot;copyright exemption&quot; for AI training. This would be the worst case scenario for our creative industry and our indie artists, as they would have no way to stop someone from using AI to imitate them at no cost. Artists would be treated like commodities and &quot;words&quot;, uncompensated for being used to train the machine that replaces them. Japan is leaning into generative AI as a way to compete with other countries, using the artists of their own country as a training source. The sentiment from artists in Japan is so greatly depressing as well. They are being used for profit without their consent, and many look to the USA for hope in some form of regulation that protects them. I have seen an article regarding an art student sitting on a common suicide ledge, when asked she talked about AI replacing her life and being used in schools in place of learning artistic craft. To me, this is dystopian. If it comes to this in the US I would be horrified and not know what to do going forward.<br/><br/>5. I do not have an official proposal regarding legislation, besides that any AI generated portion or whole of creative work should remain uncopyrightable. That copyright law should be enforced on AI training, rather than letting it become a loophole for copyright infringement. And that there must be protections in place to ensure humans have a driving force in art.<br/><br/>This is all I have time for, thanks.
