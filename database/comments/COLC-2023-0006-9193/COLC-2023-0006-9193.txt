As both a traditionally published author and a teacher of literature and writing, I have deep concerns about the unregulated use of AI technology in the arts. For one, this technology contradicts the very purpose of copyright law, which is meant to promote progress in the useful arts and sciences. AI generated art simply mimics and manipulates what already exists. This is the opposite of progress. There will be no innovation or new thoughts/ideas/approaches. AI also flies in the face of the very purpose of art. Art is meant to explore questions about life and humanity and create empathy and connection. Art generated by a machine will lack that vital element. It will also teach future generations that writing and storytelling are not important elements of critical thinking and that they don&#39;t matter. That they can just be left to a machine. This is a detriment to all. Writing produced through AI should not be copyrighted, and AI should not be allowed to &quot;train&quot; on copyrighted material.
