No art is entirely original, as artists have always learned techniques from their predecessors, yet built upon them to create their own style. The genius of an artist lies not in inventing a completely new medium, but in the unique way they combine different elements within a medium to showcase their distinct perspective. The same applies to AI art. While the algorithms are novel creations, the training data derives from human artists across history. However, the AI artistically synthesizes this data in new ways according to the user&#39;s prompts and selections. There remains human creativity and vision in how the AI remixes existing styles. Thus, the uniqueness is the combination and rendering chosen by the AI artist. Copyright law should therefore protect AI art to encourage AI development, while requiring proper attribution to data sources. AI can help democratize art, but must respect the human artists whose work enables it. The human touch makes each work distinctive even when based on the same foundation. The genius is in the artistic combination.
