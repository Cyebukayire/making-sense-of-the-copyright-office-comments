I think the Copyright Office needs to think long and hard about giving copyrights to AI. Yes, there will be people who will argue that AI creators therefore own what the AI creates, but I would oppose this on the basis of monopoly. When a single AI can create not one book in 6 weeks like the fastest authors today can write, but millions if not billions of books over the same 6 week course it drowns out real creators. Right now AI written stories are mostly garbage, but eventually they will become well-written. For that reason we, as a society, must put our foot down and stop this surrender of our creativity to AI. If we don&#39;t then in 6 weeks where a human writes one book, we&#39;ll have a billion made by AI. Creativity that is the soul of humanity will be lost. <br/><br/>We&#39;ve all heard the stories about patent offices claiming nothing new will be invented a hundred years ago. We could see a future where that&#39;s true in literature. Where AI writers outpace humanity&#39;s by a factor of billion. Making effectively nothing new invented creatively.
