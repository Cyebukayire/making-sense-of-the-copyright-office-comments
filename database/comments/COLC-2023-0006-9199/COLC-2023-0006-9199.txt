You need to regulate how these major companies are using AI. Meta currently has a project, where they will use AI to steal a persons likeness, facial expressions, etc. all without paying them. This is an invasion of privacy.<br/><br/>Secondly, AI is supposed to help the people of this country, NOT put us out of jobs. Allowing AI to be in place of the American worker is a travesty, and must be regulated to prevent jobs from being taken away.
