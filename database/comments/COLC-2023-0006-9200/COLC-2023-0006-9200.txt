GenAI is nothing more than an advanced collage machine built on statistics. It does, in essence, plagiarise since it can&#39;t reproduce any data that wasn&#39;t fed into it prior. As such no output of genAI can be copyrighted, and most of its use by customers, in fact, constitutes a breach of copyright.
