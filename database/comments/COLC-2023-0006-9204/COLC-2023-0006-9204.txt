As a working professional in a creative field, unregulated AI threatens my livelihood. It is generated with the work of living people who did not consent to its use as such, and thus is unethical. It will (and has already) lead to mass layoffs in various industries. It will (and has already) become a horrifying source of mass disinformation utilized by teachers, lawyers, students, doctors, and other essential workers. We need protections, and regulations, and laws regarding when, where, and how AI is used, as well as what content it is trained off of, and we need them now.
