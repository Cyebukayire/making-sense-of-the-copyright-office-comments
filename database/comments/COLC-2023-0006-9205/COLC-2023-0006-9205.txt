Generative AI is an absolute insult to every single artist that has ever lived. It does nothing but steal from countless artists. Studios and consumers want to replace human artists with this AI because they think it can do the same thing as human artists and it&#39;s cheaper, but what they don&#39;t realize is that it isn&#39;t creating anything. It does nothing but steal art work and regurgitate it into a new image. It can&#39;t create. Without human artists it wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything. Art is something that has been with humans since the beginning, why are people trying to take that away? Generative AI shouldn&#39;t be legal in any way. Please don&#39;t let studios and consumers continue to devalue artists.
