The act of copyright should 100% be to protect work that is created. While I don&#39;t believe AI is stealing from existing work, I also don&#39;t believe it is &quot;creating&quot; as all it can do is assemble information it already has, no matter how new or different that assembly is. While some will argue that assembly is what creation is, the philosophical version would run against that. More importantly, though, recognizing AI as content creators, instead of tools like word processors and software, would allow for folks high up in media to deprioritize the legitimate content creators working for them in favor of ones that live on their computers. There&#39;s not only legal and ethical reasons for refusing to copyright AI content, but moral ones. Let AI be for work that no one wants to do, not for work that hundreds of thousands are clamoring for.
