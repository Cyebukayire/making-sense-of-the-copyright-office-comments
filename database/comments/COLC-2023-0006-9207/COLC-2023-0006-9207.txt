The deception of AI is crippling and a tool for propaganda. Hollywood was created by humans to entertain humans. If AI Script are copyrighted and then produced who is the entertainment for? This will lead to me only watching stage plays or watching book-to-film projects only, because I know humans created it and our imagination is unlimited; unlike AI.  Machine generated Arts is code, not Art.   Why teach literature any longer? Why teach singing (if AI will make the songs) machines have no place in the create arts. This is human space and must be protected.
