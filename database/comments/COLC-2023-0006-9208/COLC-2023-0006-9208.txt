Hello, I&rsquo;m writing in to make my comments known about AI. I&rsquo;m a professional author and nothing terrifies me more than someone feeding my work into a program that will then be used to put me out of a job. AI is a misnomer. What we have now are just regurgitation machines regurgitating poor facsimiles of drawings and movies and music and books without the benefit of what a human mind and soul can bring to the equation. Nothing about what AI creates is original, it is all based on the hard work of human beings who are able to create from more than just previous data points. People use their experiences, their aspirations, their fears and dreams to build entirely new things.  <br/><br/>In addition to the lack of any actual artistry &mdash; we see what corporations are attempting to do now with &ldquo;AI&rdquo; &mdash; steal work, put it through a program, and minimize the role of actual people so they can cut costs and and put more money into shareholders&rsquo; pockets. Why give the creative role to a machine who can&rsquo;t actually create anything? AI will decimate progress and uniqueness in the arts, because again, it cannot create. It can only mimic, steal, and make embarrassingly stagnant copies of what humans build. Corporations are so ready to throw humans under the bus, I have a very real fear that this program&rsquo;s mimicry will impede my ability to work and make enough money to survive in this country. <br/><br/>For all of the above reasons, I don&rsquo;t think AI-generated-work should be copyrightable. And I think it&rsquo;s laughable that we&rsquo;re even considering it given how much this all feels like the emperor&rsquo;s new clothes. Everyone is telling us AI is the new wave, but there&rsquo;s nothing new about it. It&rsquo;s vomiting out what we&rsquo;ve already been seeing for decades, but with the added injury of not paying the people who created the work it&rsquo;s stealing. I&rsquo;ll end with a quote from Nick Cave&rsquo;s letter on chatGPT: &quot;ChatGPT&rsquo;s melancholy role is that it is destined to imitate and can never have an authentic human experience, no matter how devalued and inconsequential the human experience may in time become.&rdquo;
