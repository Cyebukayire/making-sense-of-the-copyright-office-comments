I am a software engineer and an aspiring voice actor. This puts me in a position where I&#39;m reasonably aware of how a lot of these &quot;AI&quot; systems work as well as in a position to have creative works of my own potentially used by these systems in a manner which would directly impact me.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, these &quot;AI&quot; systems aren&#39;t really an artificial intelligence, they&#39;re a learning algorithm which recognizes and repeats patterns. Fed into these systems are the works of many different creative people. Artists, performers, etc. The output generated by these systems can be evaluated and rated to improve output and over successive generations it adapts to better simulate a desired outcome. Ultimately, however, these systems do not produce original content. The creations from the system are all plagiarized from multiple sources and recompiled in a manner as to not appear plagiarized. But simply brute forcing a mimicry of other peoples&#39; work does not make something an original creation. <br/><br/>The old saying that a sufficiently large quantity of monkeys with typewriters would eventually churn out the works of Shakespeare applies here. We&#39;re just replacing the monkeys with computer cores and having the computer spellcheck it all and give it a thumbs up when it produces something resembling coherent content. Eventually it produces something that looks and reads like something Shakespearean, but lacking in heart, meaning, and nuance. <br/><br/>If we allow these &quot;AI&quot; systems to take root in creative endeavors, they will kill the market for actual human talent. This could have disastrous effect on the art, literature, music, and film industries. Humanity, stripped of creative endeavor, our culture turned into a mess of endlessly recycled and regurgitated media, would suffer as a result.
