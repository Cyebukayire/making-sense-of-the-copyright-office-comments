Re: Copyright Office<br/>[Docket No. 2023-6]<br/>Artificial Intelligence and Copyright<br/><br/>I am making this submission on behalf of myself to bring attention to aspects of AI Generative software, and it&#39;s reliance on a user interface, that seem to have not been raised before. This is a fundamental part of the discourse which appears to be being ignored! <br/><br/>General Questions:<br/><br/>Question 3<br/><br/>Answer,<br/><br/>The UK House of Lords undertook a committee report to consider chaing UK law to allow text and data mining for commercial use. See https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5803/ldselect/ldcomm/125/12502.htm<br/><br/>As a result of discussion it was discovered that such a change in law would put the entire 100 billion UK creative economy at risk.<br/><br/>This is because it if text and data mining were allow for commercial use then foreign-based entities, individual and corporations could raid UK firms for their Intellectual Property and create competing works/productions at an exponential level using AI technology. The UK would significantly lose out in copyright licensing fees revenue and the creative economy would collapse as a result. It would completely eviscerate copyright law!<br/><br/>This report was followed up by, House of Commons Culture, Media &amp; Sport Committee Connected tech: AI &amp; creative technology Eleventh Report of Session 2022&ndash;23<br/>https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/41145/documents/201678/default/<br/><br/>wherein it is stated,<br/><br/>&quot;Our report explores the impact of the development of AI. First, we scrutinise the UK&rsquo;s proposals for regulation of AI in the round, before focusing on the implications of the proposed copyright exemptions for text and data mining (TDM), which risks reducing arts and cultural production as mere &ldquo;inputs&rdquo; in AI development. We call on the Government to abandon its plans for a TDM exemption and work to rebuild the trust of the creative industries.&quot;<br/><br/>So it should be clear that any kind of &quot;fair use&quot; exception in the US for AI training using copyrighted works could also lead to the collapse of the US creative economy as foreign entities could raid all US firms for their Intellectual Property! Thus effectively ending copyright.<br/><br/>
