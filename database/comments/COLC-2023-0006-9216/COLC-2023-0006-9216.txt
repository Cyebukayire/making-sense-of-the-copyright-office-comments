The use of generative Artificial Intelligence as a means of creating art, writing, music, or replicating a known voice, is inherently harmful and dangerous to the medium itself. <br/><br/>I am an artist, and therefore my opinions and viewpoints are from the perspective of someone who is in danger of having my art stolen and fed into a generation model without my consent. When this is done, anybody can create an image using my work and style while I&#39;ve developed meticulously over the course of 10+ years. As an artist, I deserve to deny anybody access to my art, and currently I am not protected from theft due to AI.<br/><br/>My opinions also cover the use of AI as a means of generating text and writing, music, voice replication, etc. In the context of voice replication, actors and celebrities are subject to having their voices and likenesses stolen without their consent, and replicated to generate clips of these people saying things (often raunchy, inappropriate and obscene) that they would not say in real life. This deception cannot be considered anything but dangerous. <br/><br/>In writing, every individual must adhere to strict copyright laws and avoid using the work of another. This is referred to as plagiarism. When using AI to generate text, however, the &quot;language model&quot; uses a database of text from as many sources as possible, feeds it into its model, and outputs it in such a way that it only recognizes strings of words, and spits them out without human intervention or any real &quot;thought&quot;. As such, strings of words are directly copied from writers whose work is under copyright protection, and yet because an AI has stolen it, the user faces no consequences. <br/><br/>It is all the same problem with AI art. I do not consent to my art being used for any generation model, and yet I have zero protection against this happening. I am not a well known artist, but artists who ARE have frequently found their art stolen, fed into AI generation models, and sold on stock image marketplaces as being created by the artist. The artist whose work is being plagiarized does not see a single cent of any money made. It is a scam, and a scam which harms any artist who is affected by it. And the longer it is unregulated, more and more artists will fall victim.<br/><br/>Artists, writers, actors, and ALL creatives whose work benefits those in charge of these Artificial Intelligence models need strict protection against their work. Without it, they will continue to be exploited and harmed.<br/><br/>Strict laws need to be created in protection of people like me, and these laws need to require the permission from ANY individual or corporation whose material is being used.<br/><br/>
