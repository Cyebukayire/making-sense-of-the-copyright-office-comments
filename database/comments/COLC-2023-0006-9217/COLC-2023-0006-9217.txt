I wholeheartedly agree with how the courts so far have been handling copyrighting AI generated material. I don&#39;t think that the work done entirely by an AI should be able to be copyrighted at all and only items that have had direct human intervention would be eligible. As for where that line should exactly be drawn, I think the case outlined in the notice sets a division pretty well. The comic was able to get a copyright for the text that the human wrote, and the arrangement of the images, but because the images were made by an AI, the artwork itself was not. I completely agree with this standing, the actual art was completely made by the AI, and thus not copyrightable.<br/><br/>I also do think that AI should be barred from learning from copyrighted material without explicit permission. With the way that AI has shown itself to work currently, it is not a completely new and unique thought process to generate novel ideas, but rather a rehashing and regurgitation of what it has been given. This is extremely apparent when looking at AI prompts that have a specific artist name, and then the art looks identical to what they do. It is simply reusing the assets it&#39;s learned from that artist. The point of copyrighting material is to protect it from being copied and used without permission, AI learning off of it would be in violation of that.<br/><br/>I personally do not have much experience in liability law, but from what feels appropriate to me, if there is copyright infringement, the company that made and trained the AI would seem to be to culpable one. <br/><br/>I stand with the artists on concerns for AI&#39;s ability to so exactly mimic styles and voices and would like to see protections in place for those artists
