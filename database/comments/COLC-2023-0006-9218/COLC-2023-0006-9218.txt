Kellen Urban<br/>It is my own personal opinion that AI art should not be protected by U.S. copyright law. AI art is based on already existing works of art that other people took time out of their own lives to make. Companies use AI art not to pay artists what they desire but to steal their content to sell to an audience. People who have had their art used in AI programs should be able to sue for copyright violations allowing them to fight back against the destruction of their livelihoods. Take this initiative to keep AI in check and side with all the people striking for their livelihoods.
