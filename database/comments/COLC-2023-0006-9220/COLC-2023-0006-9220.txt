I am a creative, and AI--as it is used now, and how its proponents wish to use it--would seriously jeopardize all people who create original content, whether it&#39;s writing, music, art, or any other creative endeavor. Without regulation, techbros who don&#39;t understand artistic process will harvest our words/images/sounds and spit them back out in an adulterated version, one that doesn&#39;t pay the original creators. As a copyright holder, I do not wish my works to be used for AI.
