Generative AI is built on the work of creatives who are now being displaced from their own industries as a result. This work - be it writing, illustration, or other form of art - is often stolen from these people and used without their permission or financial gain. Corporations looking to cut corners and pay less for an inferior product have already begun to fire their creatives in favor of AI; I&#39;ve seen it happen with my own eyes in the film industry already. From a humanitarian standpoint alone, this loss of jobs should be enough to put a stop to AI tools, but if we&#39;re looking for a legal rationale, look no further than the stolen work used to power them.
