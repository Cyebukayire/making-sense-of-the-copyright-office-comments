I believe that the usage of AI is something that is unable to ever be copyrighted. AI is not a person, it&#39;s a dataset, and the people using the programs do not have express permission from a majority of parties on the usage of their copyrighted work for the programs. People&#39;s livelihoods are bing stolen in the name of technological progress, and it is scaring everyone, for this usage of AI could spread from the creative realm into every other industry until no one gets a job. As a citizen, I do not feel comfortable having my jobs replaced by an algorithm, and the lack of action by the government to stop AI from being implemented everywhere as a job replacer is disappointing. If AI is to be used, then express permission from artists must be given, if not, then the AI is to never use said persons work.
