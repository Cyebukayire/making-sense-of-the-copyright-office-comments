As an artist my livelihood is at risk by AI generated content. People are using it to scam others who may not know better that the &quot;artist&quot; they are talking to is really not an artist at all. They are not creating this content. They are simply typing up a prompt and stealing from ACTUAL artists by borrowing their work for their AI generation. This is unacceptable and I&#39;m extremely upset by it&#39;s use in all creative fields.
