Re: Copyright Office<br/>[Docket No. 2023-6]<br/>Artificial Intelligence and Copyright<br/><br/>I am making this submission on behalf of myself.<br/><br/>General Questions:<br/><br/>Question 8<br/><br/>Answer,<br/><br/>There are no circumstances whatsoever where unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train AI models constitute fair use?<br/><br/>It&#39;s simple common sense. For instance if it were fair use to take everyone&#39;s copyrighted work, including that from Disney, Marvel, Lucas, et al, then that would effectively end copyright law.<br/><br/>As an example, the Japanese company Nintendo could take all of Disney&#39;s Intellectual Property and essentially launder it through AI systems to make an exponential amount of derivate works works, and if Disney complained then Nintendo could just claim &ldquo;fair use&rdquo;! That would be astonishingly absurd!<br/><br/>It would end copyright law completely! The amount of licensing revue lost would be astronomical, and the whole US creative economy would completely collapse as there would be no way to protect copyrighted works from being used by AI systems world wide!<br/><br/>Be serious now!<br/><br/>
