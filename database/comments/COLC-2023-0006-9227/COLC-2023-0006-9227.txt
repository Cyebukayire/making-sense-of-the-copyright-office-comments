To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>We, the creative community, do hereby state that any use of AI in creative spaces should be outlawed. This technology steals existing works and claims it as its own for the profit of marketers and others who would use it so they don&#39;t have to pay artists, writers and actors for their work.<br/>There have been repeated examples of derivative AI art online where it&#39;s clear that the program used existing works to create a perversion of the original, and even smudged the artist&#39;s watermark or signature, further proving that AI art is THEFT.<br/>Studio heads and producers who use AI technology to steal people&#39;s likenesses and re-use them for creation and marketing purposes without permission, or having AI clauses in actors&#39; contracts is despicable and predatory. The same goes for voice prints and vocal patterns being sampled and re-used to make it seem like people said things they didn&#39;t, and as technology improves, digital fakery, both with audio and visually, is going to get more complex and harder to disprove as the real thing. There needs to be a REAL LAW in place to halt such practices, and outlaw the use of AI in creative industries like film, television, audioplays/audiobooks, music, and of course digital artwork, or someday it may spread to other places, like political figures, witness testimony, and other things where having the GENUINE ARTICLE, MUST NOT BE FAKED.<br/>This is a battle for the soul of the creative heart of the world, and AI in this capacity needs to be outlawed in favor of the artists, actors and other creative people, not for corporate profits.
