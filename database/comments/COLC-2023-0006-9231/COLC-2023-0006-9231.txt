Given that AI models are built on others work, whether it be writing or art or otherwise, the AI models themselves are not capable of generating original work. They should be treated as such. They are imitators not originators. If a writer or artist does not consent to their copywrited work being used to build an AI model&rsquo;s database, it is copyright infringement for the AI model&rsquo;s builder to use that work and they should not be permitted to do so.
