As a writer, artist, and business owner, I feel that AI is infringing on the things that I create and own. How do I know if I publish something online that it won&rsquo;t be fed into an AI generator for someone to use for their own benefit, without credit, or other malicious intents. AI is being rapidly developed and pushed to the public without any testing or thought of the ethicality of it or what it&rsquo;s outcomes could be. AI feels like someone microwaved the dinner their mom made for them and maybe put some garlic salt on it and saying &ldquo;yeah I made this myself.&rdquo; Or putting a 5 star restaurant meal in a blender and saying it&rsquo;s better than it was before and then selling it. It&rsquo;s not their work in the first place.
