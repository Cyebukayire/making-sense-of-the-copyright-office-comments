I agree with the stance the courts have taken that in order to be copyrighted, the material must contain more than 50% of human-authored content.  I believe that using copyrighted data without consent to train AI is infringement, and the fine should be substantial to discourage others.  I strongly feel that using AI to generate a human-like persona that mimics a person&#39;s appearance, voice, mannerisms, and other pieces unique to that individual is identity theft, and should be treated as such.  Not treating it as identity theft opens the door for deep fake videos. Without severe identity theft repercussions, the door is opened for heavy abuse and misinformation.  Imagine a deep fake of political, religious, or cultural leaders being released as &quot;real&quot;, or of an actor/artist showing up as CGI generated, and displaying the actor or artist performing in a manner or a work they would not agree to in real life.  It could be a role they would have refused, nudity or behavior they would have refused to perform, or lyrics they would not have spoken/sung. The potential for abuse would cause irreparable harm to the individual.
