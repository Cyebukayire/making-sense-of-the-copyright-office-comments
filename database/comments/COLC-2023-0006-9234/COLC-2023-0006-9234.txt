I believe it doesn&#39;t make sense for AI generated art to be copyrightable. The nature of AI&#39;s ability to generate things endlessly means the body of copyrighted work would balloon exponentially. Many models used for AI art generation are trained on media that itself is copyrighted, often without the permission of it&#39;s creator. Simply put, AI does not have the right to own it&#39;s product.
