1. I believe that AI-generated material would allow people to more cheaply and quickly create content. However, I worry that not only would this decrease the payment of human efforts to create content, which are valuable due to both human labor and artistic merit, but it would also result in a sort of ourobouros. Long term, if AI content dominated any field, the AI would eventually be trained on AI-generated data. Over time, this could result in AI degenerating just as people begin to rely on it.<br/><br/>As a creator myself, I find myself less willing to publicly share work, and less incentivized to work in the field. My primary occupation is as a software developer, and I have even seen fellow developers use AI to create code, which also worries me greatly. The public are finding it more difficult to determine what content is human generated and what is AI generated. People are also drawn more and more to talking with AI over other people, especially young children. I worry about what effect AI will have on their development and if it will cripple their social skills.<br/><br/>2. As a software developer, I&#39;ve seen colleagues use AI to generate code rather than writing it themselves. I worry that without properly vetting the data used to generate code, the AI will produce shoddy code that will then become the industry norm, and the quality of products will deteriorate.<br/><br/>5. I personally believe that any AI trained using copyrighted data should not be monetized, whether it be paying for its use or using the generated material for any commercial purpose. While I do not hold any copyrights myself, I am presently attempting to write a novel. If I were to write this novel, publish it, and find that the novel had been used as part of a large dataset to train an AI, I would feel as though my work was being used without my permission, even though the AI would not regurgitate wholesale quotes from the novel. Someone who holds a copyright should not have their work used in an AI.<br/><br/>While I do not specialize in AI technology, I do have some experience working with AI. The AI uses its training data to predict the next in a pattern. It is different from how a human might read several books and use those books as inspiration for their own unique (and thus copyrightable) ideas. The AI does not &#39;think&#39;, and any &#39;new&#39; content is merely &#39;noise&#39; added to the equation to prevent repetitive or samey entries. While AI can be useful for some tasks (recognizing patterns, predicting trends), I do not believe that it is useful for generating content. It cannot generate content without a large amount of data, and it is very difficult, if not impossible, to procure such a large quantity without making use of copyrighted material. Using this copyrighted material violates copyright, and thus anything the AI generates cannot be used commercially, and may not even be able to be used for educational or personal use.<br/><br/>By legislating AI, the government can protect the rights of copyright holders as well as protect creatives from being replaced by copyright-violating AI.
