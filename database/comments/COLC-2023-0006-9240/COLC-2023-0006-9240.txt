As an artist and a writer, I have been dismayed to watch as generative AI has been increasingly used to consume copyrighted work without permission or payment and then spit out soulless approximations that take business from independent creatives. Art is a deeply personal and human pursuit that helps society continue to function by allowing the public to feel deep emotion and transmit meaning. When we claim that art can be created by computers without human input, we are saying that the lived experiences that people pour into their art and writing do not matter and the public is too unsophisticated to notice the difference. We do. AI-created art is of a consistently low quality that overwhelms the market just like fast fashion or cheap tech does, and it has the same effect of making consumer experiences worse all around. Experts are already predicting that 90% of content on the internet will be AI-generated within a few years, but news outlets who have published AI stories have shown that AI cannot understand context and gets most facts horribly wrong. It is just a matter of time before the inaccurate information gets someone hurt or killed and one of these AI companies gets sued. If the federal government gives its rubber stamp to AI it will cause long-term harm to everyone who relies on the internet to do their jobs and connect with other people in an effective way.<br/>
