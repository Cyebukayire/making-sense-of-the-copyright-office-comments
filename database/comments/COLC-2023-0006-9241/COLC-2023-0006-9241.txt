Per our country&#39;s laws, copyright exists &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts.&quot; Large-language models, or as they are colloquially termed &quot;AI,&quot; do not benefit the progress of science or any useful art; they are not capable of producing original works, only works derivative of actual human science and arts, and the largest models are based upon highly unethical if not outright illegal harvesting of said human creations in order to produce said derivations. Plus, given the many documented cases of LLM-produced works being erroneous, such as the court case where ChatGPT invented cases that do not exist to support a lawyer&#39;s argument, to treat these works with the same gravity as classically copyrightable works will degrade the already rocky quality of discourse and education in this country.<br/>It is my firm belief that nothing made with LLMs should be granted copyright, ever, for these reasons; to do so is to pervert what copyright is intended to do and send this country&#39;s arts and sciences in the wrong direction.
