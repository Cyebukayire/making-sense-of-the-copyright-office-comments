AI tools are copyright infringement machines.  They devalue real art while failing to provide the humanity of it.  They devalue real work while failing to provide the reliability of it.  Use of copyrighted works to train them is absolutely infringement of the worst kind - careless, profit-motivated, damaging to the original creators.  <br/><br/>AI-generated works, no matter the level of human involvement, can NEVER be copyrightable because they are harvested from already-copyrighted work.  They are the act of thievery callously divorced from even the idea that you should know what you are stealing and from whom.<br/><br/>Liability for infringement should be harsh remuneration based upon the understanding that the damages caused by these tools are very real, monetary and steep.<br/><br/>Mimicry of existing performers is a crime I would liken most closely to kidnapping and should be punished as such.
