I feel that AI generated content is in violation of copyright law, or should be, as it draws from the actual creations of real artists and writers to generate artificial art and writing. I also believe that AI generated creations cannot truly be considered art or educational, as they cannot replicate the nuance, emotion, or creativity which can only be achieved by a human creator. If AI works are not regulated by copyright law, I believe companies will default to using ultimately cheaper AI generated art for creating content and services, which will overall detract from everyone&#39;s quality of life. An AI program is not capable of empathy, emotion, understanding, or nuance, all of which are essential in every facet of human life. While AI could be useful in certain spheres of life, it absolutely should be regulated strictly to maintain artistic freedom and educational integrity.
