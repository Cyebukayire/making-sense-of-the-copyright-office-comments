Firstly, AI should be able to train on copyrighted material for free. The AI is merely learning from it. People learn from copyrighted material all the time, so AI should be allowed to do the same. If AI is not allowed to learn from copyrighted material, then it may harm the quality of the work.<br/><br/>Secondly, anything produced by an AI should be within the public domain. The copyright should not be held by whomever used the AI, whomever made the AI, or whomever owns the material the AI was trained on. The work of AI is transformative, but it is not Human made.<br/><br/>Thirdly, nobody should be held liable if AI generated work is similar to copyrighted content. Almost everything people make is inspired by something else. If it can be proven that someone intentionally tried to make an AI imitate a copyrighted piece of work, then the prompted should be held liable.<br/><br/>Fourth, AI should be allowed to freely imitate the styles, likenesses, and voices of people. Nobody has an issue with people imitating other people, so we should not have an issue with AI doing it.<br/><br/>AI is an important tool that should not be stifled. Many people are making a big deal about AI because they don&#39;t understand it. Another important thing to keep in mind is that even if we regulate AI, other nations like China won&#39;t, which will allow them to outpace us.
