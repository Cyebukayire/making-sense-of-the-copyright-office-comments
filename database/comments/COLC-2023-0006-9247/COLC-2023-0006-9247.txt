As the source material for generative AI has been, in most cases, obtained without the permission of the copyright owner, it is by its very nature a violation. Giving copyright protection to creators who use it and call the results their own, when it is nothing of the sort, is a slap in the face to the original artists and authors. It&#39;s nothing more than plagiarism dressed up in a fancy package, and it is theft of intellectual property.
