Bad news bears. Big bad news. Artificial intelligence is a threat to my livelihood as I work in an artistic industry. Big companies could use it as an excuse to lay off artists by the thousands. If companies dont pay their workers, then workers cant buy food and clothes and can&#39;t pay taxes. This would cramp economic flow in a bad way.
