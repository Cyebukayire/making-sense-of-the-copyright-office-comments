Nothing generated by machine learning should be copywrite-able ever, full stop, unless the person making it owns the rights to every image or video or piece of text it was trained on. Additionally people should continue to have the rights to their own likeness, so if someone owns rights to a lot of images of you they can&#39;t make more images of you using AI and sell those. There should be serious financial penalties for being discovered concealing that something was made with AI to get around any of this.
