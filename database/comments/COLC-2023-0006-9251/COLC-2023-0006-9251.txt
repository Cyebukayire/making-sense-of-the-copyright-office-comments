As an artist, AI makes me extremely discouraged to create. I feel that the environment is not safe to share my work because it feels like nothing stops someone from scraping my art for a database. It feels as though there is nothing stopping someone from making an AI replica of one of my pieces and selling it. Something must be done so that artists won&#39;t have their art stolen
