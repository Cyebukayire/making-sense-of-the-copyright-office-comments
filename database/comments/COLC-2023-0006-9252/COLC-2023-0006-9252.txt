I am writing to implore the U.S. Copyright Office to take appropriate action to protect the rights of human creators against the use of AI trained on their work without consent. <br/><br/>As AI services are trained on the creations of real people, it can only create content because of the contributions of artists and authors. AI creations should not be considered original works then, and the training of AI on creative works without the express permission of the creator should not be allowed. The use of AI has already begun to negatively impact artists and authors such as myself by taking away opportunities for work that are given instead to a machine that was made using stolen content. AI creations made without permission from the artists it was trained on should not be protected under copyright law. <br/><br/>Art and writing created by individuals without the use of AI should be protected by copyright laws against the unlicensed use of AI programs being trained on their work. Any AI program should be &#39;opt-in,&#39; requiring creators to expressly give their permission before their works are used by the program. Without these protections, artists of all kinds, ranging from those employed by large media companies to independent creators, will suffer.<br/><br/>Current copyright law protects against art being stolen and sold by someone else as their own work, so the law should reflect the same spirit with AI. No one should be able to copyright material that an AI created using stolen work.
