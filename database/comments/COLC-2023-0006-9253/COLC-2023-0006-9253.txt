Long story short, Artificial Intelligence is NOT intelligent and any out should not receive a copyright.<br/>Long story long, I picture the idea of memory and thinking as a massive Amazon warehouse with one guy and a shopping cart. There&#39;s only so many &#39;data boxes&#39; the guy can fit in his cart. The cart can be roughly thought of as processing power. It has limits. You can juice up the cart guy by having a series of carts follow behind him (a cache) so he can grab commonly used data boxes more quickly. You can also layer multiple guys in multiple carts all grabbing data &#39;boxes&#39; at the same time (parallel processing) so the guy isn&#39;t too far from another guy who&#39;s getting useful data boxes (like a cache, only different.)<br/>KEY POINT #1: What slows down our human brains is that we actually dedicate most of our &#39;cart space&#39; to sensory information. Pretty obvious why that choice came down. Unlike human minds, &#39;cart guy&#39; can totally dedicate all space to the recall and computational stuff that does not require sensory information. AI can only be trained to pull up a data box of a response based on a statistical calculation that, based on how all the other data boxes in the warehouse get accessed, this box is the next most likely response. That is a statistical model, not intelligence.<br/>KEY POINT #2: Unlike computer brains, human minds have mirror neurons. These allow us to picture what someone will say or do next. It may be why we see ghosts or believe that forces of nature have personalities. AI is using a mirror neuron &#39;trick&#39; to make our mirror neurons categorize it as intelligence, but the way our minds work is different. If an AI system calculates the next response based on previous data, it can be said our brains do the same. A little. Maybe. Not Really.<br/>KEY POINT #3: How our brains actually work, mostly: Visual data (mom) goes to back 2/3 of the brain where it is parsed and identified (this is a pic of mom) it then goes to amygdala to define feels for image (I like my mom) and then to decision in front cortex (I&#39;ll save this picture) and then to action (put pic in drawer). Yes, we used some previous data there, but not really. I learned this while researching therapy approaches for my son who has a diagnosis of autism. Some autism research shows that autistic folks have a brain block between the steps of seeing the mom and going to the amygdala. However, there is a back-route to the amygdala that happens when you see something with high affect or emotion (mom is cheering, snake about to bite) and it uses a different and more powerful safety circuit to cause action without so much thought. Build up this path enough and it can be used without the scary snake, if you get the idea. So we (like many families) used high affect in our interactions to build up that emotional circuit. <br/>KEY POINT #4: treating the thought &#39;processes&#39; of AI as actual creativity is 1) not true and 2) misinforming the public about how brains work. Only bad things can result.
