I am concerned about the replacement of human artists and creativity with AI generated art&mdash;written, auditory, visual, and otherwise&mdash;which uses human creativity, whether willingly or unwillingly given, to benefit large corporations at the expense of the human artist. At this time, human artists working for large corporations are already treated poorly enough (See the WGA strikes and similar), and I worry of the potential that AI has to further ruin both the quality of work and the compensation for the human artists whose work was used to train it. <br/>I do not support the ability for AI generated work to be copyrighted, as it is using a conglomerate of actual human efforts that are most typically stolen from their creators, and there is no actual creative element that goes into the piece. Further, I am worried that not enough is being done to protect the works of human artists that are being used to train these AIs, whether the work is copyright protected or not.
