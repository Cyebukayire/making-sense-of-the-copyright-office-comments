There is a high chance that artificial intelligence will ever go away, especially with the significant usage of AI focused on creating content like art, music, writing, etc. However, in order for AI to generate content that is good enough for the untrained eye, it often uses and exploits artists, writers, composers, and any creative based worker. It never credits the artist and often does more harm to artists who have spent years of effort to reach the level that they are currently at. AI shouldn&#39;t necessarily be banned, but it should be regulated. AI should list who it used to generate the content and artist should have the right to opt out of models and databases that are used to train the AI. This technology directly harms these artists and infringes on their own copyright and rights to the art that they have created.
