I do not feel it is appropriate for material made by generative software (or &quot;AI&quot;), be they a visual medium or a written work, to have copyright protections in any capacity, especially based on the technology&#39;s current structure and methodology. Generative software in its current state, particularly image based ones, creates media that is, at its best, soullessly derivative, and at its worst, blatantly plagiaristic, by copying and combining elements from countless existing works to &ldquo;create&rdquo; something new, when in reality it provides no meaningful transformative changes to the works used in their data training sets, nearly all of which was taken and used without the consent of the original artists. Currently, the primary use of the technology is not to help artists and writers streamline and optimize their workflow, but to undermine the hard work of other artists and writers, as well as the creative process as a whole. Corporations also seek to use the technology to replace human workers, while simultaneously emulating their work. If works created through this practice were allowed to have the same protections as works created by human creators, it would result in a monumental loss of jobs in many creative industries, as well as having a detrimental impact on society as a whole, causing a stagnation and sterilization of media, stifling creativity, as corporations would likely be emboldened to create more and more soulless and meaningless content.
