My opinion is that Machine Learning on copyright materials would be much less of an issue if there were a shorter expiration period for copyright.  Death plus 70 is ridiculously greedy.    Perhaps if there were a separate and much shorter copyright restriction period for machine learning, it would be less of a crippling blow to the technology to impose such restriction.    My personal opinion is that 30 years past initial publish date is more than adequate for copyright.
