AI is a tool when properly used; unfortunately, I see too much potential for misuse by unscrupulous &#39;authors&#39; padding out self-pub book with AI, students using AI to write papers without learning topics, and businesses using AI without themselves having a good grounding in writing or research. All are people who don&#39;t know or care they&#39;re releasing inaccurate copy. Ignorant people failing upward is how we get national isolationism and domestic terrorism. AI can be a great tool, as long as it&#39;s used alongside critical thinking.
