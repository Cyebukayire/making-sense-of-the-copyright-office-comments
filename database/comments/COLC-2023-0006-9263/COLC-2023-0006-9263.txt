I am an artist and a writer. I have been working professionally as an illustrator in the games industry on and off for 10 years. The recent influx of generated images have caused me and my industry peers to loose out on a large part of our clients recently. I am financially stable without this work but my friends are not, I am seeing the struggle of the entire industry and the financial strain it brings. I have gotten my work scraped, reassembled and sold for profit without my permission. As a consumer of art and literature I see platforms flooded with low quality content, drowning out actual artists works and making it hard to find genuine works of human beings. Please help us and make the commercial sale of generated content, and for the platforms to profit from the genarating of art and literature outlawed. Thank you.
