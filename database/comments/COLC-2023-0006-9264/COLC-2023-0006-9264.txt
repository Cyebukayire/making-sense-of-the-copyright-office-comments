Copyright is supposed to help creators get some means to live from their work, instead of having that work sold by someone else who takes their profit.<br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence is not conscious, and as such isn&#39;t a creator, it&#39;s a tool. this means that a person using that tool&#39;s output without adding anything of their own aren&#39;t creators. Furthemore, those intelligences are exploiting productions of actual creators, in a more advanced version of tracing a drawing and passing it as your own. <br/>Meaning that this art isn&#39;t creation but distorted repetition, with little or no sense of how the sources will mix. Crucially, if let loose too freely, it&#39;ll run out of its own sources, the human artists that can&#39;t produce as many pieces.<br/> <br/>  AI generation can be an interesting tool to spur creativity, or help with more tedious aspects of creation, it has also shown its comedic potential in the few years preceding its big explosion. None of those uses necessitate copyright to be applied to the pieces.
