AI-generated content has been an absolute plague upon not just the creative community but our economy as a whole. Companies like Netflix, Disney, WB and other affiliates are looking to use AI-generated content compiled from actors/actresses&#39; voices so they don&#39;t have to pay real people anymore. They are unwilling to work with writers and would rather use artificial intelligence to do the job for them. This is putting thousands if not hundreds of thousands out of a job. Without real, breathing human creatives and talents, there is no industry. Its because of these people that we have what we do, now. The regulations.gov site has a logo, for example. That was made by a person and they were paid to do the work because that is the kind of work they want to do. If Artificial Intelligence had made it, not only does the site holder have a great risk of treading on someone elses copyright, they cannot protect it because it contains elements that belong to others. People use AI-generation because they&#39;re lazy and do not care about the consequences; they use the excuse they cannot afford x, y, z so they punish real, human creatives instead. These AI-generator(s) and their developers have already made it clear that they do not care about the economic or financial dangers ( they have ADMITTED to this ), let alone the socio-anthro dangers. AI content includes deepfakes. This inherently puts EVERYONE at risk as long as their face is online. That includes children, that includes anyone who thinks their face might not be online but an ex-friend uploaded a photo of them from ten years ago. <br/><br/>Helpful links about whats going on with AI in the real world: https://stackdiary.com/zoom-terms-now-allow-training-ai-on-user-content-with-no-opt-out/<br/>https://twitter.com/kortizart/status/1674481402828722176?t=T1Ak6AIvxC0LKwnZFFSo5A&amp;s=19, https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/28/openai-chatgpt-lawsuit-class-action/, https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.414754/gov.uscourts.cand.414754.1.0.pdf?fbclid=IwAR38RZAJHU4kBqpqyC_CIRXl_RWITJyZeuVaSvlvoT2_V-E-wYlowtGCOhg_aem_AR8BvcGFdXFzjgrvF9F1hHb2nvJI92IPBidAUdbF6k7aVZ9Ll-gMzVmnPvV76xMlW_g, https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/openai-facing-another-copyright-suit-over-ai-training-on-novels
