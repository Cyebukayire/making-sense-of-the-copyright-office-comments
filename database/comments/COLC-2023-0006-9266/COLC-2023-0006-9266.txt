Since AI models are trained on existing works by others, I don&#39;t feel it would be appropriate to grant standard copyright privileges to AI operators.  I also feel that the growing AI industry should be regulated in a way that protects creators; even now, many artists are migrating from X (formerly Twitter) due to the change in policy that allows the company to train AI models on any art posted.  I&#39;m not saying that we shouldn&#39;t have AI art, but if artists stop uploading their art the models will have nothing to work from and these massive art-based digital communities will collapse.<br/><br/>I understand that automation can make our lives easier, but when has that really happened in the labor force?  Do we work fewer hours?  Do we have more free time?  Has all the technology we&#39;ve developed actually made our lives more fulfilling, or is it another way to increase the workload?  The essential human element to art aside, does an AI script editor give a writer&#39;s room more time to put out a quality product?  Or does it merely replace as many humans as possible?<br/><br/>Our mindset needs to shift from profit-focused to people-focused before we can be trusted with this kind of technology.  As we are now, I only imagine it will be used (and has been used!) to replace kobs instead of supporting them.<br/><br/>TLDR; AI operators feed prompts into the meat grinder and don&#39;t actually create the art.  Why should they get to copyright an amalgamation of others&#39; work?
