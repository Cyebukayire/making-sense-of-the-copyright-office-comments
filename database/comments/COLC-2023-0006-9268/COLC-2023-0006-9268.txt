AI learning models use content created by others without their consent or any form of credit/recompense. As an author and artist I have been refused commissions because &ldquo;AI is free.&rdquo; These models are built off of labor that they do not legally own. Images, written works, and other creative pursuits made by AI is not a unique creation, but an automated form of collage.<br/><br/>AI produced artwork and writing should NOT be protected by copyright. I believe that it should be considered infringement of copyright for an AI to use a creator&rsquo;s work to train their model without consent. Protecting AI generated content is encouraging the theft of intellectual property and the disregarding of small businesses.
