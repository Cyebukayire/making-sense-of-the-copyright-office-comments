AI generated ANYTHING should not be allowed to be copy written, it&#39;s thievery and down right wrong, all the AI generators who claim it&#39;s stolen art/writing/imagery/voices free have already been corrupted by stolen material!<br/>The stuff made purely by hand and not someone clicking a button to make said thing should always be held higher, it takes a lot of skill and practice, determination and will power to create such things, allowing AI generated crap to linger for so long that now it&#39;s in question to be allowed copyright claims is not good for anyone, peoples&#39; jobs and lives are at stake if that becomes the case, voice actors have now lost their jobs cause their voices have been implemented into AI generators without their consent, artists are losing their fire to create cause their work is just being uploaded into AI generators, there are even people going to conventions and taking pictures of displayed art and uploading it to AI generators.<br/>AI generated ANYTHING is nothing but a disease that needs to be burned, the fact that it has lasted this long is honest to god sad, nothing should be &quot;generated&quot; it should be created.
