Artificial intelligence poses an incredible risk to human development and the overall integrity of the arts, and use of art in the training of AI models should absolutely be considered copyright infringement. Artificial intelligence, as with any development of human ingenuity, should exist to make human life better and more sustainable. Instead, use of AI in art, writing, media production, etc, only stands to take from the highly valuable skills developed by real people (such as illustration and design) and transform these culturally significant aspects of society into mass-produced, soulless reproductions. AI art as it exists today does so only due to the labor of artists who do not consent to its use. The continued use of AI in this manner will not only greatly decrease job opportunities for humans, but will trivialize the arts, which have been a core part of human cultural and societal development for centuries. As an illustrator, artificially created art poses a huge risk to my livelihood and to human creativity as a whole, and threatens to render an entire massive portion of human culture into an automated shell of what it once was. As such, extreme regulations should be put in place to limit its use, particularly in media productions as a replacement for human labor, and copyright laws should be enforced heavily so as to protect the lives of millions of Americans who work in creative fields.
