Generative AI art should not be considered copyrightable material because, inherently, it is NOT new material. Generative AI could not &quot;create&quot; anything without being fed other people&#39;s works first- and in fact, sometimes hardly even changes the image or text from its input. <br/>Generative AI relies- at least for now- on art theft from real human artists to &quot;create&quot; new works; works which often appropriate the style or even signature of the original artist(s), leading to confusion and misattribution. Additionally, many generative AI texts contain misinformation that could be anywhere from mildly confusing to extremely dangerous. Imagine Googling whether two house cleaners can be safely combined and reading a generative AI article that says they can when in reality, they&#39;ll create a deadly gas together? This is not far-off, as I personally have already come across incredibly misleading health-related articles that were AI generated and &quot;edited by humans&quot;... which we all know means &quot;skimmed at best&quot;. <br/>Lastly, people are currently using generative AI to make money claiming it as &quot;their&quot; art when it reality, it is almost always a cheap knock-off of an actual artist&#39;s work. And more often than not, the artist themself is not doing nearly as well as the tech bro profiting off using their work without consent or repercussion. <br/>Generative AI poses a huge risk to several key creative industries, and can lead to dangerous situations due to misinformation. Please do not allow generative AI works to be copyrightable material, and please work to protect the artists whose livelihoods are endangered. Mine included.
