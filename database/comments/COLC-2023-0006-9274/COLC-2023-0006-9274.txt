AI images has caused confusion and frustration, is basically stealing with less effort than before. Before, people who abuse the copyright system just clip the video or screenshot the image [and remove the signature if needed]; and usually people noticed the stealing and report easily. Now, people are using AI from existent image or video source like The Avengers and Shovel Knight without doing anything and profiting. And some of the images are deceiving to the average viewer who thinks is real but is not and profiting from an unknown artist because they are more popular in a community. And the worst part about AI is misleading or false information, with the average user could have been trick by an AI image of a shooting in the White House or the president of Ukraine hanging out with the president of Russia that can lead to more chaos. There is also the chance of increasing of scams like pig butchering and romance scams.
