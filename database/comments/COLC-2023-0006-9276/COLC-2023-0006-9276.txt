As someone who has sold their art in the past, I see how troubling AI art can be if unregulated. Currently, AI users are profiting off of years of collective data of thousands of artists who did not consent to this form of usage. Voice actors, digital artists, singers, all who have worked hard to hone their abilities are being stolen from and mimicked. As a society we need to see the value of artists and protect them. Regulation would be highly advisable, as otherwise this theft will continue and cause economic hardships on all artists.
