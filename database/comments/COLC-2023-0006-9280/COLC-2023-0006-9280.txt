hi, my name is chisomo. i don&#39;t know if anyone will ever see this comment, but the ways that ai is been put on a pedestal has been crazy and needs to be deplatformed. it does not need to be in spaces of art, and used as a means of threatening people out of jobs because they don&#39;t want to open up their pockets and pay their employees. as much as ai can be useful in today&#39;s current society, it poses very deep and detrimental effects on its people. with programs like deepfake and photoshop available, making ai accessible can not only put people&#39;s jobs at risk, but can have children and adults at risk of having pornographic images and videos made of them, saying and doing things that are false. as programing and rendering get better in the future it will be harder and harder to distinguish what is real and what was made on a phone or computer.
