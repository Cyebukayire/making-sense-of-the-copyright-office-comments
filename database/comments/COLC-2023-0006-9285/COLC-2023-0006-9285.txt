From a legal standpoint, Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated images should be considered under the same precedents as music sampling. The process by which AI creates images is by definition a transformative process. While the computing models used for AI do rely on pre-existing images, the amount of data required for said models makes it extremely unlikely that a legally identical image would be created.<br/><br/>As with the creation of music by artists who &quot;sample&quot; short segments of existing songs, the use of pre-existing images to influence the rendering of new images should be considered Fair Use. The responsibility lies with the artist using AI tools to ensure their work does not cross the line into plagiarism. This may be achieved through the skilled usage of text keywords and AI parameters.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering public opinion in this matter. This is a transformative technology that should not be feared, but welcomed and regulated in a manner that encourages further creativity and innovation.
