As a multimedia artist, writer, and computer science professional, I am of the strict belief that AI generated works should NOT be protected under copyright law, even when heavily modified by a human. The term &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a misnomer, as there is no thought occurring within any AI, despite what it may seem. AI is essentially a word generator that understands syntax. When you ask it a question, it looks back at everything related to that question, and creates sentences based on what it&#39;s seen before, without regard for if what it&#39;s saying is true, moral, or even if it&#39;s plagarizing something. For example, if you ask an AI how many giraffes are in a picture of a cat, it will always say at least one- if there were no giraffes, you wouldn&#39;t ask.<br/>This false notion of intelligence is why so many think AI can truly create, and it cannot. All it can do is generate sentences based on key words. If any work has ended up in it&#39;s data it will use that work in its writing. It doesn&#39;t know that it&#39;s plagarizing, nor does it care, if it were even capable of understanding plagarism.<br/>Because of this lack of understanding, no work from an AI will be truly unique, and may be copied from an existing story verbatim. No amount of human intervention will ever be able to address the fact that AI is just an advanced word generator that was fed other people&#39;s creative works. Copyright should never be used to protect plagarism, no matter how high-tech it is.
