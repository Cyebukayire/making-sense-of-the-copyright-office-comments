I do not like nor appreciate AI works, as it is built off the ripped up pieces of other works; both of Artwork and Literature. As a freelance artist myself, this severely impacts my line of work, because a lazy man could go &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t need to pay this person for artwork, I can feed all their old artworks into the machine, and print out new pieces of artwork just for me.&quot;, which is loss of revenue for me, and, in personal opinion, feels like it is in violation of my copyright of my artworks.
