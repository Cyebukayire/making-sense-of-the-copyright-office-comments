As an author who is friends with many other authors and artists, I think AI in general is incredibly toxic to artistic fields. I personally do not think it should be able to be copyrighted, and I also don&#39;t think that people should be allowed to train AI off of copyrighted work without permission. I have seen numerous examples of people&#39;s work being stolen, and heard many stories of artists losing commissions due to AI. While it doesn&#39;t personally effect me at this point, I can&#39;t help but be frustrated on their behalf. The idea that someone could use AI to create work based on stolen property and then copyright that work is intolerable. The issue grows more complex by the day but personally I think AI should be kept out of creative fields entirely. AI generated &quot;art&quot; cannot measure up to the amount of learning and effort that artists put into their craft. It certainly should not be protected under the law.
