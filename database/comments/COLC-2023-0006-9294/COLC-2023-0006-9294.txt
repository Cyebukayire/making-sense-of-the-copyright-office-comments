As an individual creator struggling to protect my current works and future business endeavors, I believe works generated by artificial intelligence should not have any copyright protection. Artificial intelligence models are databases that scrapes from pre-existing copyrighted works and do not use them in a transformative matter; rather, they copy the work and pass it off as their own. Therefore, this does not fall under fair use as other human-generated transformative works, such as fanworks, would. These AI-generated creations are not the product of a human&#39;s ingenuity, skill, and passion to create, unlike actual transformative works that are the product of humanity&#39;s passion and desire to create art.<br/><br/>With the ongoing SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes focused on many demands, including banning AI-generated works, it is more crucial than ever to protect humanity&#39;s ability to create and profit from the efforts of their creation. If AI-generated works were permitted to be protected by copyright, companies would push out human creators and use AI-generated works as much as possible to cut costs and profit off of works that have had little human influence other than the copyrighted works that have were already scraped and part of its database. This would not only have a detrimental impact on the creative laborers that keep the media entertainment industry alive, but also the profits and quality of the products from the media entertainment industry as well.<br/><br/>Please consider this comment carefully and prevent AI-generated works from having copyright protections. Thank you.
