I do not believe that AI generated works should be able to be copyrighted.  It&#39;s a known issue among the artistic community that these AI programs are often if not always trained on artwork that they were not given permission to use, meaning that it&#39;s increasingly easy to copy someone&#39;s style completely.  When this happens, these artists lose the income that would have been generated from a commission, since a stranger can create art in their style without paying for the work.  There are numerous ways that this could also be used maliciously, such as copyrighting a work in the style of a famous artist depicting subject matter they wouldn&#39;t agree with, thus harming their reputation.  Thank you for your consideration.
