As someone who works in the book publishing industry, I am mostly concerned with the fact that not every AI generator has to publish its training corpus. As such, writers who use AI tools may be inadvertently plagiarizing other authors. At the same time, I don&#39;t believe in regulating the individual use of AI -- so how do we bridge this gap? <br/><br/>Putting aside the ethical implications, from a copyright perspective I don&#39;t believe that anything written via machine learning (ML) can be protected by copyright. If we were to award copyright, I believe we would have to award it to the ML model itself, since it was the one to generate the text. (I want to clarify that I specifically mean the ML as an entity. OpenAI doesn&#39;t generate text; Chat GPT does. So in this scenario, the copyright wouldn&#39;t go to OpenAI the company, nor any of its founders, but to Chat GPT itself.)<br/><br/>Of course, a ML cannot be held liable, as it is not a person in a legal context. With that in mind, I think works produced by Chat GPT (and other ML models) should be considered public domain. <br/><br/>I essentially see these tools as &#39;automatic blackout poetry&#39; or &#39;automatic collages&#39; -- it&#39;s fine to make blackout poetry and collages, but you don&#39;t own the original composite pieces, and unless you significantly remix the original materials, you have to credit those people. Chat GPT doesn&#39;t have the capacity to credit its original sources, so in lieu of that, I believe works which are proven to be mostly (or entirely) produced by MLs should not be copyright-able in the first place. I am unsure how you&#39;d determine where that &#39;point of no return&#39; is -- the act of parsing AI-generated works from their similar, human-made counterparts is a science and not an art. The AI detectors are made by the AI companies; the call is coming from inside the house. <br/><br/>In summary: I believe that it&#39;s important to preserve the intellectual property of the artists and writers whose work went into training ML models like Chat GPT, Bard, Chai, and others. If there is a feasible way to do this (such as requiring these companies to publicly post their training corpus, ensuring that no one author had lots of their work used as training) then we should do that. But I imagine that is outside the purview of copyright -- so, if we can&#39;t regulate the companies, we should at least agree that the work ML models produce is public domain in the most literal sense of the phrase. <br/><br/>Its writing was trained on the public; its output belongs to the public.
