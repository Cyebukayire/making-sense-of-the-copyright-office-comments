Depending on the AI, my understanding is that it is problematic legally in up to two different areas. One, the AI exists as a non-person legally that still has creative impact, like that of an animal. So holding the AI to laws on animal art ownership, the AI can not, itself, hold copyright, and therefore any works it creates are public domain. Two, a large majority of AIs &quot;creating&quot; both images and text are trained on copyrighted and trademarked works whose human rights holders never gave permission for those works to be replicated to the AI or its creator(s). I use &quot;replicated&quot; here because that is how our current AI models work. They cut and paste pieces of the most likely related works in their training data into the &quot;created&quot; text or image. Finally, if both of these are agreed to be true, then that gives a third problem: that the AI can not gain permission to use copyrighted or trademarked works for its own use, as it is a legal non-entity. Therefore any works that it might &quot;create&quot; anyway are public domain.
