AI that scrapes data from public sources without consent of the copyright holder should not be allowed to be copywritten. There is no way to guarantee that these data sets were sourced with consent or ethically. <br/><br/>I do believe that the use of AI by a specific creative individuals using only their own work to train data sets should be permissible, with the caveat that they can prove that this was done using only their work. <br/><br/>Also, AI that uses data from licensed data sets where copyright holders or those who hold the rights to license said properties are ethically obtained and would be copyrightable in my eyes.
