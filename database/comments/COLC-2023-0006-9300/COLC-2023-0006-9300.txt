To whom this may concern,<br/>Artificial intelligence as it stands now with chatgpt LLM NLP is like a system that predicts the next word or set of sentences.  It almost&rsquo;s memorizes information however it potentially creates it&rsquo;s own understanding (if trained properly). Just like creating and referencing research papers if any prompts use the information it should reference the author of the paper and/or data it was referenced from. Not only will this hold the current copyright but almost like free advertisement of the information it was trained on therefore promoting the content on which it is using. This potentially helps the person or parties if referencing a book for example to help promote and sell which intern helps both distribute and communicating snippets of information which goes back into the economy if the user buys the book. If on the other hand the AI system is simply not rewording the content, not referencing and claiming to be the creator of the information then it would violate copyright. Imagine if all students were infringing on copyright for simply rewording papers that would be insane the same can be applied here. Interestingly when it comes to changing logo&rsquo;s and pictures if tweaked enough by 20% it potentially becomes the product of the creator which could therefore recycle the content creatively and potentially go back into the economy and the same could be applied for NLP. Doing this with distributing text of information being the key objective to &ldquo;reword&rdquo; and &ldquo;promote&rdquo; the content therefore immortalizing and helping the parties involved and help the distribution of information. If you rule against AI content to use copyright material and only open source it essentially holds back progress, makes it more difficult for the data scientist to create good models for the quality of the data is questionable.<br/><br/>To summarize, AI models should reference content promoting it to help the authors and potentially create more revenue streams for them. It should reword the content in it&rsquo;s own words to show an understanding of subject material. The AI must not simply regurgitate the exact text and claim it as it&rsquo;s own for that will be copyright violation.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time<br/>Samuel Watson<br/>
