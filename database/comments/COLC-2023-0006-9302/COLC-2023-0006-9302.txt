No, anything, be it art, text, music, or spoken word, generated by any kind of artificial intelligence should not be copyrighted.  Firstly, these algorithms have been trained on copyrighted material without permission (in most cases) of the copyright holders, so copyrighting AI work could possibly violate prior copyrights again.  Secondly, works created  by AI are not truly art or original as they are simply generated using mathematical algorithms and are not created as works created by humans are.  There is nothing unique or original about AI generated work to copyright.
