Don&rsquo;t make AI copyrightable. Please. If something is made by AI, it shouldn&rsquo;t be copyrightable, since we all know that AI uses the art and writing of other people to create new images and texts. That would be like theft, only you&rsquo;re taking all other things you&rsquo;ve stolen and hot gluing them together and claiming it&rsquo;s yours because you &ldquo;made it&rdquo;. If someone took your car, took it apart and combined it with other stolen cars, then said that it&rsquo;s theirs and that they made it, I doubt you would be happy. <br/><br/>AI is dubious enough as it is with the way it generates art, giving people the right to copyright those generated images would only make things worse, and would hurt the artists that the AI used to make the piece from. I don&rsquo;t have any studies or links, but I do have common sense.
