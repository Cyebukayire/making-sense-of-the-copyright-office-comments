To the US Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am a professional business analyst that does writing work as part of my job. I am also an amateur author who publishes works via Amazon and on a personal blog.  I occasionally commission artwork from artists for my writing, if there is something that I am incapable of making myself (my art specialty is limited to graphical icons for software.)<br/><br/>My views on the AI &quot;revolution&quot; in the last year is that no AI created work, either generated text or generated artwork, should be subject to copyright if the data set that it was derived from was already copyrighted by another person or organization.  That is, if someone sets loose an AI bot on their own internal work for a data set training, works to which they themselves already own the copyright, then the new work can be copyrighted.  But if the AI data set was trained using copyrighted works from others, such as public writing (Wikipedia) or art scraped from Internet image searches, then it is by its very definition not owned by the person who fed a prompt to the AI generator.  <br/><br/>Applying this to my own specific job scenario:  I am one of two documentation authors for niche industry software for veterinary teaching hospitals and state labs.    If an AI data center were to scape my publicly available writing as part of training, without paying me or my organization for it, it would be a violation of the explicit copyright my organization has for our documentation.  We keep our software documentation free and accessible for the benefit of our clients.  Someone using my writing style to train their AI data set would use my words and my voice (and in many cases, wholesale paragraphs lifted straight out of my writing) and I would have no way of knowing that it had been done.  My organization would not receive any compensation for the usage of our documentation.  And I would receive no compensation for providing that data set training, despite having obtained a BA in English and a master&#39;s in Business Technology in order to develop the skills needed to write clear documentation. <br/><br/>AI data sets trained on public information is art and writing theft as far as I am concerned.  Like any other form of transformative works (fanfiction, fanart, etc.) it would be extremely difficult to enforce a copyright against.  But the majority of derivative works are well aware that what they have created is based on someone else&#39;s world, and are fine with that.  They do not seek compensation, and usually do not provide direct competition to the copyright holders.<br/><br/>AI &quot;artists&quot; and &quot;writers&quot; violate that unspoken rule and are trying to compete directly with the artists and writers from whom they stole from when they trained their data sets.  If an artist spends weeks or months perfecting a commission that they will ask a thousand dollars for, but their AI generated competition offers the same thing for a hundred dollars, then it can quickly push legitimate, original artists out of business.<br/><br/>We do not have many weapons against this theft - blocking copyrights of AI generated art or writing, and thus being able to bring suit against those who stole from us for violating OUR copyrights, is going to be our only recourse for preserving our livelihoods in the future.
