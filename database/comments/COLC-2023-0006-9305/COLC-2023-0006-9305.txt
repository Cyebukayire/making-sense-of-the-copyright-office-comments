AI can be used for generating ideas, analysis, editing, and creating non-copyrightable materials. AI-generated books, novels, manuals, and generally copyrightable material that have not been significantly modified by a human, should not be allowed to be copyrighted. In addition, there should be a notation in some form that the material is AI-generated. The reason for this position is that people can write misleading things, but AI is learning from everything that is input and output. At some point, the content AI creates could become misleading information that is posited as being true. Ai is a tool. Not an author, nor is it an expert.<br/>The exception is if there is a significant human modification to the AI-generated content that materially changes the original generated content. This would apply to written material as well as  AI-generated Art where the artist materially changes the original generated content to create a new image. (Much like using several images in Photoshop to create a new image.)
