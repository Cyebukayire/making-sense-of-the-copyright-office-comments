The current use of AI does not reflect a just or equitable use of art or peoples&#39; intellectual property.  It is a threat to the rights of creators and poses a dangerous precedent of false information being spread.  I believe AI should not be able to use works in their databases without the consent of the creator/owner of the work.  I also believe that works that are AI must be explicitly stated to be AI, so as to limit falsified information being created and spread.  It is the responsibility of the U.S. government to protect the intellectual property of its citizens and uphold truth.
