I&#39;ve had several artists that I know complain heavily about their work being stolen by other people specifically for use in AI-generative models (chatbots, AI art makers, etc.) and quite frankly to allow these models, which so often rely on STOLEN data, to have their work copyrighted is to fly in the face of the idea of copyright in the first place.<br/><br/>At least, that&#39;s my view.
