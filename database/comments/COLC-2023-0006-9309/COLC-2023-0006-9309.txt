As a professional, licensed tattoo artist, the current attention on AI-generated &#39;art&#39; is incredibly disturbing.  The emphasis on AI is clearly intended to reduce costs by redirecting funds that would be paid to artists and instead directing it to AI software.<br/><br/>This software is then trained on stolen art - very few artists have given active consent for their works to be used in the creation of these heuristic AI databases.  Any products of these AI, then, are copycat facsimiles benefitting from the stolen work of artists in order to reduce costs.  This is an incredibly dangerous path.<br/><br/>In order for any creative fields to survive, AI-generated content must be heavily regulated.  I would propose two major steps in regulation.  First would be to remove any artistic copyright protections for AI-generated content - the wheel of law have already begun moving on this, but it should be more strongly codified into legislation.<br/><br/>Second, the use of stolen art for AI training should be criminally prosecuted, and it must have higher repercussions than simple copyright theft.  When stolen art is fed into an AI for training, it&#39;s not just stealing one piece of art - it&#39;s using it to generate potentially infinite art pieces in the future, robbing that artist of a lifetime of compensation for all related images.  The criminal charges for using art to train an AI without the artist&#39;s consent must address the unknown, potentially vast loss of income, loss of exposure, and loss of career development.<br/><br/>I hope that the government takes seriously the impact of AI onto creative workers.
