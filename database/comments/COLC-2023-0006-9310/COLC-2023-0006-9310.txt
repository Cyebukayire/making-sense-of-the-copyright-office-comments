Procedurally generated images (&ldquo;AI art&rdquo; or &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; or &ldquo;AI-generated art&rdquo; are all misnomers) are not copyrightable, and shouldn&rsquo;t be copyrightable. The same goes for procedurally generated sound, video, and text. The final products are created entirely by machine learning, using stolen data from human creators as direct source material. Unlike human artists and inventors, machines cannot take inspiration and cannot innovate or further develop an idea. They do not differentiate between copyrighted and non-copyrighted material, and cannot comprehend copyright law or create an idea on their own. It&rsquo;s true that cameras and computers are tools that humans use to create copyrightable work, but procedural generation algorithms are not tools that rely on the training and ingenuity of the artist. They rely on work done by others and approximate the decisions made by others. Artists that expand upon procedurally generated work may hypothetically create copyrightable art with procedurally generated assets or pieces, but human ingenuity and creativity are fundamental to the process of making copyrightable work. Skill beyond feeding prompts into a computer application is required.
