There are clear copyright and plagiarism issues in many cases when generative AI is used for text or image content. I have had content stolen from me already because I am a website owner. The scale on which this is being done is too large to ignore. I believe this violates existing law and is extremely detrimental to creators that range from small bloggers and artists to worldwide publications.<br/><br/>Please consider our society&#39;s experience with Napster (the file sharing website). This was revolutionary, transformative, and it played an integral role in how our society developed. However, we also had to shut Napster down because it was clearly violating the law. It was theft on a grand scale, trying to get by using the excuse that &quot;this is the new era&quot;.<br/><br/>Generative AI is the same. This is plagiarism on a grand scale.<br/><br/>Solution: give proper credit, program AI to respect &quot;noindex&quot; tags just as a search engine would so that creators can opt out of having their content and ideas stolen.
