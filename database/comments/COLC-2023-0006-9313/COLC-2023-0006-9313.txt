With regards to: (1) the use of copyrighted works to train AI models, I feel that such use must only be with the knowledge, consent, and compensation as agreed to by the original creator. To do otherwise is to devalue their copyright on their own works, and degrade the quality of similar works by other creators.<br/>(2) the copyrightability of material generated using AI systems: I believe that AI-generated material should not be eligible for copyright, regardless of whether the materials used to train the AI was by consent of the original creator. It is however, more offensive if the training materials were not used with consent.<br/>(3) potential liability for infringing works generated using AI systems: I believe that infringing AI works should be treated as liable as any human-generated infringing works would be. The user of the AI system is not the creator.<br/>and (4) the treatment of generative AI outputs that imitate the identity or style of human artists: AI outputs that are used to imitate the identity or style of human artists should be treated as copyright infringement and potentially fraud, depending on whether there was a financial transaction involved.<br/>In summary, I do NOT support the use of generative AI outputs as any sort of copyrightable final product. There may be limited uses as a basis for &#39;prompts&#39;; ie generating a list of story topics or art themes, but such uses would not be copyrightable content.
