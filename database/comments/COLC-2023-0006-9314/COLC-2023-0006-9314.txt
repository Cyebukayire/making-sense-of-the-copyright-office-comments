Visual artists are already so taken for granted and typically have so few protections compared to other industries. AI takes this a step further in dehumanizing, commodifying, abd outright abusing artists and their work, woth no wway for artists to protect themselves or their intellectual property from theft. AI tools can also be used for nefarious and dangerous purposes, such as creating fake images of real individuals in compromising positions (ie: revenge porn, child porn, framing people for illegal activities, etc) by simply submitting a photo of that person and typing a prompt. The danger without regulation currently far outweighs any good that generative AI currently has going for it. Protection needs to be put in place for artists, voice actors, writers, and other creatives whose work has been stolen and used by others for a profit.
