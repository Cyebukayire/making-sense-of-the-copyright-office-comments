If I were to write a university paper without citing my sources, I would be expelled for plagiarism (i.e. stealing someone else&#39;s content). So, if someone uses my writing to train AI and then has that AI write them a paper, I see it as no different than them not citing me as an author on their paper. Is the whole point of copyright not to prevent people&#39;s original creations from being misattributed?? As an extension, is this point not meant to encourage individual thinking and creativity as our country was based on? <br/><br/>I think the presence of AI is also making people lazy and dumb. People rely on software to write their papers, do their grammar, and make their art. If you place any emphasis on critical thinking, education, and personal artistic freedom (which you should, because my understanding is that that&#39;s your office&#39;s entire point), do not allow AI-generated works to be copywritable. And honestly, if it were up to me, AI would be banned altogether, for the same reasons I have listed above.
