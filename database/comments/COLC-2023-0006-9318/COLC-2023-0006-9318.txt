My name is Ceda Xiong and it&#39;s been my dream as a five year old to be a writer. AI does not dream. AI does not have emotions or aspirations. And more importantly, AI is not labor. Writing is an act of labor and for that reason, AI must not be allowed to steal the labor of writers. As a society, writers contribute enormously to the well-being of our citizens, we reflect what is true, compassionate and what is worthy of reflection. Without humanity writing for future generations, our existence will lose meaning, our work loses its importance. For many Large Language Models, AI cannot reproduce itself. Once AI starts reiterating itself, it veers off course from relevance to humanity. The only way AI maintains its relevance for business is constant human input. And constant human input is labor. Until our world finds a way to support human life without giving everyone jobs, AI is taking jobs away from the people who provide the labor, then stealing that labor and passing it off as its own.
