I feel like AI copying people&#39;s voices is something that needs protection from, due to fraud issues, and possible bans. As for other things using AI material i thought of a fair compromise: you can use any sort of AI material but any material using AI to produce it cannot be copywritten due to using other people&#39;s works without their consent, so it can be used freely if you are not making money off of it. If is attained for free from artists, the people using it that way should not be able to make money off of it.
