Because of the nature of Machine Learning Datasets (AI is wholly inaccurate to what these products are.) It is impossible to properly credit individuals who may have contributed unique phrasing or concepts unknowingly by means of data collection of publicly available but copyrighted works. (For example a text excerpt from a book posted in a Facebook post is still copyright to the author of the original text but may end up in a dataset sold by Facebook.) Machine Learning does not produce novel ideas. Machine Learning predicts what the most common idea it has already learned fits into the prompts given to it. These programs are nothing more than advanced predictive text dictionaries with larger memories and cannot be the sole author of any copyrighted work.
