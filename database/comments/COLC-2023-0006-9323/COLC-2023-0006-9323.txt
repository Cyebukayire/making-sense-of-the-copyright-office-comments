Companies should not be allowed to use copyrighted materials to train their AI. Since AI has no creative thought or consciousness, training AI on copyrighted materials turns into impersonation at best and downright plagiarism at worst. It&#39;s unfairly stealing the hard work of real people for financial gain, without even crediting (let alone paying) those real individuals.<br/><br/>AI content should not be able to be copyrighted, because copyrighted materials consist of original or creative thought by a human being. AI is incapable of either originality or creativity, and it is not human. Therefore copyright should not apply to AI generated materials.<br/><br/>If a human uses copyrighted material in their own creative work, they must always credit and often pay for the use of that material. The same should go for AI, and that material should only be used with the explicit permission (and agreed upon compensation) from the human creator.<br/><br/>If a human being mimicked or impersonated another human with the intent of financial or other gain, they would be prosecuted. If AI mimicks or impersonates an artist or other person for financial or other gain, the company that owns that AI should also be prosecuted.<br/><br/>Finally, as a business professional in marketing, I already see the effects of AI in my field. Many entry-level writing jobs have been completely or partially taken over by AI, which means younger people are having a more difficult time breaking into the field. In ten years, there won&#39;t be nearly as many upper level writers and business professionals because entry-level jobs were stolen by AI, therefore a whole generation of people may not have the opportunity to even start in that field, let alone progress to a higher level.<br/><br/>Not to mention that without human expertise and regulation, AI can easily release false information that gets absorbed as truth, further feeding AI and resulting in a cycle of lies and misconceptions.
