I run a small independent business online through various social media platforms. I take independent commission work from people who decide they want some of my artwork. I am physically disabled and on SSI, doing individual commission work I feel is my purpose in life and how I keep myself feeling productive and useful. In recent years, AI generation tools have become more of a threat to my livelihood. I am competeing with people who can do my job faster than I can and possibly using my own art to do it, with no permissions from me and no revenue coming my way. I feel it is harmful for my business, many artists from my walk of life feel the same. It is in my personal opinion that AI generation tools require federal guidelines and moderation, and that artists (independent or otherwise) be provided protection against having our work stolen and used without our permissions. I believe these tools are becoming wild and dangerous, we must gain control of the situation before it becomes more out of hand. I hope my voice is heard.
