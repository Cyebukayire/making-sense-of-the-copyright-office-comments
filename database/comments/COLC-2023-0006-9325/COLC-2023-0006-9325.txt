I&#39;ve published over a dozen titles under various pennames in since 2019, starting with short fiction markets and jumping into indie publishing in 2021. Some of what I write I share online in public places, and in this day and age the likelihood of it being scraped is high. But I also have ebooks and paperbacks containing words that only exist in that format. I want people to pay me for them. <br/><br/>I&#39;ll admit, at its basic level, to have used AI. One of my covers was generated in Starry AI (though I added elements prior to publication) and many of my editing tools have been trained on LLMs to provide me with grammar advice. I&rsquo;m not against the use of it in creative works, but I do feel like AI should be regulated to being tools versus creative engines.<br/><br/>I understand that many AI technologies, like ChatGDP, are simply word calculators. Predictive text, based on analyzing millions of examples, and that the contribution of a single work, such as one of my novels, can be hard to pinpoint. But a single image in a 400-page text is a small part of the material, whose contribution to the whole is tiny and whose exclusion would make little impact, still must be licensed and credited. And while personally I am comfortable in my working existing in an LLM model for training purposes, once it has been used to create a commercial product I expect to get credit and payment for my novels&rsquo; inclusion in the product. AI products built off of other&rsquo;s works need to give credit for that work, especially as new versions of Open AI&rsquo;s software had been developed for commercial reasons. AI works. We know this. We&rsquo;ve seen it do amazing things, but using it to develop work or services for a profit, where profit is the goal, should pay due to the work it&rsquo;s built on. <br/><br/>Legally, it&rsquo;s already my right to determine commercial uses of my novels. I would like that enforced. <br/><br/>In terms of copyright protection for AI work, I agree with the current stance that unedited works shouldn&rsquo;t have copyright protection. They are the output of code, and while there is skill and decisions being put into prompts, ideas have never been copyrightable. Ideas aren&rsquo;t protected. And Google&rsquo;s predictive text used to help me compose emails doesn&rsquo;t give Google full right to that email. <br/><br/>However, I do want to encourage the use of AI as I believe it can open up expression and make certain artforms more accessible. In cases where AI provides a jumpstart that a human finishes, or helps a human perfect a work (like many editing softwares) I welcome that work being copyrighted. However, I think the threshold should be high for human evolvement &ndash; at least 70 of the project should have been created by a human, even if that &lsquo;creation&rsquo; was the use and selection of brushes, filters, colors, as is the case in many digital art works. If the majority of choices that go into a piece of art were made by a machine, then it shouldn&rsquo;t be copyrightable.  <br/>
