AI generated scripts, art, code, etc. shouldn&#39;t be able to be copyrighted. Besides obliterating potential artists work and putting tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands of workers out of business, it can cause the closures of art schools too. AI looks at, and takes pieces of, already made scripts, codes, and images to make its own content. It steals and makes products in the same vein as a cheap knockoff. It&#39;ll not only be damaging to the economy through harming artists, but pull into question copyright itself. It draws from what it wants with no regard for laws or rules. The product of AI should not be copyrightable work.
