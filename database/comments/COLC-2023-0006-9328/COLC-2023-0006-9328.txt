The idea of thoughtlessly generated AI works being copyrightable is an affront to human creativity and the rights of the common working American. By taking away power from writers, designers, and artists, tech companies and media giants would further accrue wealth at the cost of the working class. Furthermore, AI are consistently and constantly trained off of copyrighted works without any sort of permission, including the works of small businesses and independent artists. Until legislation is put in place to prevent this from occurring, AI generated works can be assumed to constitute intellectual theft.<br/>One of the biggest challenges facing America is appropriate legislation to keep pace with technological innovations that, left unchecked, pose a very real threat to the wellbeing of its citizens. This is further hindered by often  non-tech-saavy representatives. Please take this opportunity to serve the interests of Americans.
