AI writing and art models require vast amounts of data and be able to collage them into something recognizable. Often times, the people/companies developing the AI do not bother to get consent from artists or writers before feeding the AI the data, because they don&rsquo;t have time to get that many creators to consent. In my opinion, this is plain and simple theft. If an AI model cannot function without countless hundreds of hours of stolen labor and creativity, I&rsquo;m not sure the AI should exist. AI creators and enthusiasts should focus on making sure that the creators they want to replicate have consented to their work being used and are fairly compensated for the work they&rsquo;ve put I to their craft if they want AI to be considered anything more than plagiarism software.
