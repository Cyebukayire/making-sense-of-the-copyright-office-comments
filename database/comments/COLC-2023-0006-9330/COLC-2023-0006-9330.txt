I think that the way the robots were trained on language was unethical, but not illegal. If we&#39;re going to be up in arms about the fact that people profited from other people&#39;s hard work, we&#39;ll have to go back much further than AI in order to do so. (Indigenous peoples, African Americans, etc.) Once we get that situation resolved and have appropriate reparations, then maybe we can talk about AI. But it&#39;s very hypocritical of people to get all self-righteous now when THIS IS HOW AMERICA WAS BUILT. That said, all we can do about AI at this point is maybe require that people put in some kind of disclaimer, but even that is going to be hard to regulate because where does AI start and where does AI end? Are we talking about when words are generated by an AI tool, or when people look up a list of synonyms online and choose one, or when people rely on spell-check to correct errors? It&#39;s a slippery slope. I don&#39;t think we need to fight AI, just figure out ways to use it.
