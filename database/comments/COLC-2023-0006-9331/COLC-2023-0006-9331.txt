When we learn something, we pay money and tax for studying, buying books, attending elemantary middle and high schools and online classes. Even when we see a data at a website, maintaining a website also costs. But big AI companies just use and learn data from anywhere for free? It is unfair and it will be harder to distinguish if it is human&#39;s work or AI&#39;s work. it will definitely destroy the value of artist&#39;s creations and copyright. And if so, human&#39;s desire and motivation for creativity will be lowered. And then we can expect in near future, there would be no human things and AI would just conquer the human world.
