I do not believe that anything created with the use of AI should have a copyright. Copyright should only be applied to works created by human beings who are capable of creating and consenting to the dissemination of their creations. The only way AI can function is by processing the work of others at a rate that is unobtainable by standard humans, and the work that is consumed is done so in a way that precludes the consent of those creators. If humans can be sued for artistic infringement and plagiarism, any AI creation should be subject to that same standard.
