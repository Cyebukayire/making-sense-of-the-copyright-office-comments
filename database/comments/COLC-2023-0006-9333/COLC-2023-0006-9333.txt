HELL to the NO on all AI attempts at Copyright for art, cartoons, music, and film either physical or digital. It &#39;s a betrayal of the human essence of all art forms and will discriminate against human thoughts and creations. AI is NOT human and should NEVER be allowed to copyright any works as it will take away from true human artists. This includes HYBRID humans. If any computer particle or nanotechnology  is assimilated into the human brain&#39;s thought process it should be disqualified from copyright protections. PERIOD
