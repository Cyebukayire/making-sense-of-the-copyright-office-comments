I absolutely and wholeheartedly agree with the Copyright Office&#39;s determination that creations of generative AIs are not copyrightable because they lack human authorship. <br/><br/>RE Question 18: <br/>Humans should not be considered authors of material produced by generative AIs. They are rightly authors of any prompts that they use, and the text of any iterations they request, but if especially if the creation in question is a &quot;cross-medium&quot; (text-to-image, text-to-audio/visual, or vice versa) then they cannot claim authorship. This is (poorly) analogous to an human visual artist who asks their friend for a prompt, or an artist working on commission for a client. The friend or client (the human prompter) may have IP protections on the ideas that they share, but the creation is the product of the artist (the AI). In the case of commissions, or work-for-hire, artists can choose to sign away both their copyright and their authorship claim, but since AIs cannot sign contracts, or own property, but are what actually create the output, the human prompters cannot claim authorship.  <br/><br/>RE Question 20: Legal protection for generative AI outputs is not desirable. Copyright is not an intrinsic right, or to borrow the economic framing, purely to allow the copyright holder to collect rents on their creation. Instead, it is a system to incentivize new creation by creatives. Giving legal protections (to disallow copying or unauthorized usage) to generative AI outputs would encourage new generative AI outputs, to be sure, but that encouragement already exists in the form of the vast cost savings of using an AI to create an image, or summarize text, that would otherwise have a high labour cost. In another framing, the copyright prevents publishers from finding a writer who has labored over their novel for 3 years (or 3 months, or a day) and selling their work--if copyright didn&#39;t exist, fewer people would devote 3 years (and perhaps a college education) to creating art. The cost incentive for AI output already exists--no labor, only computation, and if an output is &quot;stolen&quot;, it has little impact on incentives because costs are already so small. <br/><br/>RE Question 21: The Copyright Clause does not permit the copyrighting of AI-generated works, because giving copyright to AI output does not fall under the umbrella of &quot;securing... to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right&quot; to their works, because humans cannot be authors or inventors of specific generated outputs.  <br/><br/>RE Question 31: Congress should absolutely create right of publicity laws, and those laws should probably be a ceiling, not floor: the omnipresent consideration of copyright law and other IP laws must be how overrigorous enforcment can chill creation, invention, and reinvention. <br/>
