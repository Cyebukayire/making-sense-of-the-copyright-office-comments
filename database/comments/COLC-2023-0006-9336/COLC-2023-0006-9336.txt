Unsupervised automated heuristics (for that is to what the colloquial use of &quot;AI&quot; refers) come with vast, intricate depths of problems for legislation that attempts to surmount will fail to accommodate. Consider the following file generation algorithm: every CPU cycle, a number increments, and when the desired file is encoded in the binary representation of the number the file is saved to disk. I have just described for you an algorithm by which you may generate every piece of proprietary code ever written, and should like to thank everyone from this day forward for paying me royalties on every datum they generate.
