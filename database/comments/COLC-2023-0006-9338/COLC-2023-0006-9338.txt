Current AI is trained off of scrapped data sets, ie stolen data from thousands if not millions of artists. The artists are in no way compensated. For AI to move forward they first need to be trained on data they have permission for, and the artists should get some sort of commission when their name or art is used as a prompt. It should only be copyrightable if it is proved to have been edited more than 50% by a human artist, and that the generator they used sourced their data ethically.
