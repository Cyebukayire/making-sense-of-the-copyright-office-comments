As a creator (author) who is friends with many other authors and artists, AI has been a nightmare coming true. Every one I&#39;ve ever seen has been trained on stolen work and allows stolen work to be submitted to it, which it then uses to algorithmically build new content- it&#39;s *not* creating, it&#39;s regurgitating. Maybe what it spits out doesn&#39;t look the same as what it was fed, but it is. It&#39;s also proven to show harmful biases for things like race and gender, which no one should have to explain is bad.<br/><br/>Nothing produced by AI should be able to be copyrighted. I believe that&#39;s already the case, but it should remain so.<br/><br/>AI programmers should have to acquire permission from and fairly pay artists or authors or other creators of any kind for their work if it&#39;s used to train an algorithm. This includes voice actors. It should *at least* be considered a violation of copyright law to use stolen work to program an algorithm.
