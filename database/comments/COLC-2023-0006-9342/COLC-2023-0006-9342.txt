I am a frequent user of AI creations. Not for public use, merely for my own private fun. I am also an amateur artist. The only type of AI software I use is a chat bot (similar to ChatGPT).<br/><br/>I strongly believe that AI works (As in works created by an Artificial Intelligence/Algorithm that is trained to copy and emulate other works) should not be copyrighted, except under a very specific circumstance.<br/>The circumstance being that the Artificial Intelligence is only trained on and/or drawing only from other copyrighted works that the platform or creator owns and otherwise has access to. However if the AI algorithm has access to works not copyrighted by the same person behind the AI, the work should not be copyright able.<br/>As well as this when the AI work (Whether in the form of art, text, or anything else) should be clarified as an AI&rsquo;s creation, with proof that the AI was trained on and draws from other copyrighted works the user owns. <br/>This process would be lengthy and tedious, however it is critical for the purpose of maintaining author and writer&rsquo;s integrity. If any corporation or individual can have their work input into an AI without their consent, and then have AI model something after that work along with others, it&rsquo;s in my eyes an indirect form of plagiarism.
