I am a digital artist. Generative AI threatens my livelihood. It is an insult to create such a thing off the backs of non-consenting parties and then profit so greatly from it. Artists and other creatives like me already struggle in the professional world without the threat of being replaced by machines. We deserve to be legally protected from Generative AI.
