I am personally against AI use for any and all art. It is art theft. It is using other&#39;s work without their permission. In the long run AI will hurt more than help the future of art. Artists will lose jobs to AI and those that do so for fun will not post for others to see. This will cost jobs. Many artists feel this way, whether they be writers, musicians, painters, or any other type of creator. AI steals from people and tries to past it as their own.
