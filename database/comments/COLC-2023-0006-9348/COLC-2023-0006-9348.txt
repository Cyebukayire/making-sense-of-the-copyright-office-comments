Short comment. I asked Google&#39;s bard a question regarding poor proprioception as a cause of imbalance in the elderly. My intent was to evaluate the degree of multi-dimensionality or comprehensiveness in bard&#39;s response. When I asked specifically about bias, the answer was unacceptable. Rather, than answer with an awareness of multi-dimensionality, especially intersectionality, bard responded that it would run the data first on whites, then on blacks, then on Asians, etc. My evaluation: Bard&#39;s comprehensiveness was poor. I saved the response. Later, I checked bard&#39;s response for plagiarism. One entire paragraph was lifted from Cleveland Clinic content. I did not check futher. My assessment: I would fail a student for plagiarism and give a &quot;C&quot; at best for comprehension. My copyright opinion?
