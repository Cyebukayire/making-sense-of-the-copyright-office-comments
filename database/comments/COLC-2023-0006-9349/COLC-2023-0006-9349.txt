Generative AI machine learning systems were built on the promise of &quot;research purposes&quot; allowing it to train on copyrighted and original content. These organizations then immediately turned around and said &quot;Just kidding, let&#39;s use it for profit.&quot; I know the person reading this knows a thing or two about Gen AI, so I start this not to explain how it works but to drive home the fact that these tools were created from the jump in bad faith with the purpose of stealing protected work.<br/><br/>People say that there is nothing different between the way a human mind works and the way Gen AI works when it comes to referencing past artistic work, but there IS a difference. Humans have been making art in some capacity dating back to 30,000 BC; art is one of the earliest forms of communication. Humans can create art out of nothing, can create art before they could even speak. However, Gen AI machine learning cannot create art without stealing from existing artistic pieces. Honestly I would be ok with Gen AI if it used free domain datasets for training, or had a system artists could opt-in to should they choose to participate. But the way it is structured now, Gen AI is stealing plain and simple. It is stealing one of the core components of the human condition - the ability to express oneself through art. <br/><br/>The amount of assets that Gen AI can spit out in such small time frames makes it impossible for human artists and professionals to compete. We are afraid to post our work online because we know it is being scraped by bots to use for Gen AI. I am a designer and digital artist so will speak mostly to that, but I strongly believe these issues are the same for writing, music, and almost every single creative industry. Who benefits from our work being stolen? More corporations, the rich getting richer. It is sickening that anything I design or draw and try to share with my audience can be used against me, used to replace me in a capacity that I cannot compete with. It is a never-ending cycle, unless an artist goes completely offline. Even if someone decides to do away with sharing their work on the internet (even though it&#39;s not really possible because we need the internet to apply for jobs, stay connected with artists, etc), we can&#39;t stop others from sharing their art online (ex: A customer posting a pic to share an art print they bought). We can&#39;t hide behind paywalls because Gen AI has shown it does not care about such things. Any image or concept that can be stolen, will be stolen. <br/><br/>Please do not allow Gen AI art to be copyrighted. It is immoral, it is theft. Thank you for reading. <br/><br/>
