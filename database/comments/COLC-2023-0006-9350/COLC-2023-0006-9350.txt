Art is the biggest tattletale. You can see someone&rsquo;s history and learning journey through their current art style. Sometimes you can look at someone&rsquo;s art and think, &ldquo;You were obsessed with Black Butler in grade school, you used to doodle their eyes in your notebooks.&rdquo; &ldquo;You love playing with color. You love emphasizing features with dynamic lighting.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always loved those adult coloring books. You would create one yourself if you wanted.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been drawing for years but you hate drawing hands so you always have them hidden in some clever way.&rdquo;<br/><br/>AI images are composed of the art of other people. It did not pick up a pencil and spend years teaching itself how to draw, it took someone else&rsquo;s drawing and put it into a blender along with thousands of others, and then was told by a userbase which amalgamations are most ideal. AI does not put deliberate effort into creating its own style, it will never have its own human fingerprints. It could not be copyrighted even if the program was making the case for ITSELF. Why should any other random person who simply entered a few words and pressed a button to tell a program what to do have the right to claim it as their own? Especially with image generators they could not have been trained without a large group of people, and especially with images created with the dissected remains of artwork whose rightful owners never gave permission for it to be used for this purpose in the first place.
