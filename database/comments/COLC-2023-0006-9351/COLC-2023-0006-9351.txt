Given the broadly nature of AI learning and programs to be derived from preceding works or media wrought by human collaboration only for an mechanical output, what singular   entity can lay claim to the results of AI generated material which was not created in a vacuum? AI can only function with the collective knowledge and material scraped from across textual and virtual sources. As it is not the intentional work of a singular person or group of persons correctly navigating the use of copyrighted materials or those for public use, AI isn&#39;t something which can be granted copyrighted in my perspective and understanding of copyright protections.
