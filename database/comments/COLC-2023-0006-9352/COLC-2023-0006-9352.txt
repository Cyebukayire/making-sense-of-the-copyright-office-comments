Plagiarism by AI is still plagiarism. It makes no difference to me whether somebody stole my work or programmed an AI to steal my work for them-- it&#39;s still my work and they still stole it. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s up for debate, but obviously my view is that training an AI to replicate somebody&#39;s work is stealing, the same way that normally replicating somebody else&#39;s work is stealing, and companies should not be allowed to do it. And I&#39;m setting aside the even more troubling issue that companies are so eager to kill creative jobs.
