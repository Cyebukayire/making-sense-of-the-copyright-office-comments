I think copyright should NOT extend to AI works because there is no practical work put into them. The machines make the work with little to no input from humans, which makes AI work devoid of any real value thought. Making AI work can also lead to other issues such as the AI being used to impersonate people, with AI being trained on the work of other people. There have already been instances of this happening, such as with authors like Stephen King having his work unwillingly fed into a machine.<br/><br/>Another issue is that this will lead to the devaluation of human work. Once corporations see AI as copyright-able, many will dump their human employees in favor of the cheap alternative, leaving many previously hardworking people with no way to feed their families or send their kids to college. AI work becoming copyright-able will not help the common person, but hurt them instead and lead to further economic issues through the unemployment it would inevitably create.
