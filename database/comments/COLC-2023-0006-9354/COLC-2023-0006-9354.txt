Hi! Thank you all so much for reaching out for a community opinion, I appreciate it, even though I know everyone won&rsquo;t be able to read every comment. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t think AI work should be allowed the same IP rights as other art. As in, AI art should not be allowed to be copyrighted. As we&rsquo;re currently seeing with the WGA and SAG strikes, large companies are seeking to use AI to replace their workers and pay them a lot less money too. Another big reason is (and you might have seen celebrities comment on this) that AI doesn&rsquo;t have what it takes to create art. AI doesn&rsquo;t have mental illness; that is to say, AI will not feel an emotion so deeply that it is spurred into creation. All AI art will ever be is shallow. Uninspired. Created based on stolen artwork fed into a soulless database. Not to mention the fact that keeping the AI servers running costs hundreds of thousands of dollars per day and is a massive waste of energy and resources.
