I am a writer and Illustrator, and Generative AI is theft. There is no ethical use of it. Proponents claim that AI is thinking and innovating, but it&rsquo;s simply a complicated xerox machine. Generative AI is NOT art, and copyright should not be afforded to it.<br/><br/>Ideas and inspiration can be shared because it&rsquo;s the EXECUTION where innovation happens. Every time a human executes an idea&mdash;fresh or genre&mdash;they&rsquo;ve made a new piece of copyrightable art by filtering their inspirations and references through themselves and their specific execution. When a human executes an idea&mdash;good or bad&mdash;they&rsquo;re always working in their unique voice whether they intend to or not. It&rsquo;s an empirical part of the art process. AI prompters have ideas without execution, and Generative AI has outputs without a unique human voice attached to it. Both sides of the Generative AI equation are missing the crucial ingredient that makes art, art&mdash;the HUMAN executing the idea. The HUMAN putting themselves on the line and taking the risk. The HUMAN that can be rewarded or held accountable for their works. Artists make themselves vulnerable by putting themselves out into the world to share their art. Generative AI and their users/prompters are thieves. <br/><br/>There is great joy and great responsibility for artists when they create work in their voice. They can be celebrated or they can be held to account for the things their art communicates. Generative AI can&rsquo;t be held to account because prompters are executing nothing, and the AI can&rsquo;t be held to account because it&rsquo;s merely a machine that regurgitates its training data. AI is simply a catalog of stolen work, mashed together for outputs. If Generative AI is allowed copyright, artists like myself will be unable to stop prompters from using my artistic voice to say things I would never wish to say or be aligned with. Similarly, Generative AI forces all artists whose work has been scraped/trained into collaborations they have no control over or desire to be in.<br/><br/>Working artists can rarely afford to make a living solely for themselves, especially starting out, and depend on contract positions with entertainment companies to afford a living. The company holds the copyright, and the artist understands that in exchange for ownership of their work, they&rsquo;ll earn a wage. Allowing companies to train Generative AI on artist-employee work not only signs away those artists works but their entire identities, voices, and future works. It is immoral and unethical that artistic employment should jeopardize all that. If companies are allowed to exploit artists with Generative AI, then artists will loose their entire career in a single employment contract. Artists will loose their financial and creative existence, and be left with nothing.<br/><br/>Artists have the right to their future works. Generative AI uses artists own works against them. It&rsquo;s unfair and unethical. Going forward, If Generative AI is allowed copyright, why should artists share their work with the world just to have it stolen to compete against themselves. Generative AI is dependent on more and more human artwork to train it, because the HUMAN execution is what is of value.<br/><br/>HUMAN execution of ideas is the ingredient that makes creation what it is. Copyright should require HUMAN execution only, with NO USE of Generative AI&mdash;otherwise companies will hire one or two humans to touch up trained/stolen works of others to pass the copyright threshold.<br/><br/>AI fraud is already doing harm, flooding markets with images and texts trained off the body of artists works, deteriorating trust between artists and their audiences.<br/><br/>The argument that AI thinks anything at all, when it requires cheap, exploited human labor to filter toxic, disturbing training data from all other data, further illustrates the LIE that this complex xerox machine is in any way making copyrightable art the same way humans do. AI companies exploit humans from start to finish so that they can reap all the stolen rewards. There is no AI brain creating anything copyrightable.

Generative AI robs artists of their copyright. Generative AI robs audiences of human connection. It&rsquo;s destroying the art community, and the humanity real artwork bestows on the world. There should be no copyright allowed for Generative AI in any form.
