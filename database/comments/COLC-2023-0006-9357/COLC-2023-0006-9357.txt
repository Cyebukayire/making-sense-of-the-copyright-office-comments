I&#39;ve been very concerned as I watch the impacts of so called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; technology. I think it is essential that copyrighted works be protected from use in AI datasets, most especially for any purpose related to earning profit. I also think that total transparency is necessary to regulate this: publicly accessible (private or public owned) algorithmically generative systems/AI should keep a fully transparent and complete log of all media used to train and/or generate &quot;new&quot; material. We expect libraries to maintain a catalog and students to include a list of sources. This should be straightforward and would help to prevent abuses of copyrighted material. I&#39;m especially concerned about the effects of these kinds of technology on artists and students. Visual artists and writers already face numerous threats to their ownership of their art, threatening their livelihood. They must be protected from the new risks AI presents to the creation and ownership of one&#39;s own unique art. I&#39;m also very worried that these systems, propped up by datasets which have been assembled without consent from the component materials&#39; creators, are being used by students as alternatives to developing valuable skills of communication and creation. Limiting the datasets to paid or open access materials may make it harder for young people to use these tools to write assignments or assignment drafts for them, and is more aligned with the anti plagiarism rules and social expectations typical in academic and general settings. I think government intervention in this arena is necessary to protect the interests of our artists and students in particular.
