By no means is ai art copyrightable. It has been shown many times that ai art pulls from sources around the internet to create a new piece. This means that many different works can be stolen and put into an image or written piece without credit or any kind of compensation to the original artists. I can guarantee that if you allow these ai works to be copyrighted, you will allow corporations and individuals the ability to copyright a work that they essentially stole from others without any sort of compensation or even credit. I plead you to make it so that any and all ai works will remain un-copyright-able so you do not ruin the lives of any real working artists.
