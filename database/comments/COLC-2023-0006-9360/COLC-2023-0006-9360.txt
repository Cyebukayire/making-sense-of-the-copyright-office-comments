AI works should not be able to be copyrighted. The precedent set in Naruto v. David Slater et al. is that if a work does not have a human creator, then it is not a work that can be copyrighted. Though some may argue that you would be creating something by giving the machine a prompt, it is more equivalent to if you had an artist draw something for you or writer write something for you. Without specific provisions discussed between the commissioner and the artist, the artist retains rights over their work. The issue here is mainly that the AI cannot consent to a similar agreement as the artist, to have their work used in a commercial manner. Same as the monkey in the photo that was the centerpiece of Naruto v. David Slater et al. would not have been able to consent to its photo being used for commercial purposes. Though some would argue against this saying AI is a tool similar to an art program or word processor, the AI is the one that creates the visuals or written works that is the centerpiece of the argument. The value is no more in the prompt given than someone saying &quot;A drawing a grassy field at midnight.&quot;, what is the true object of interest is said drawing of the grassy field.
