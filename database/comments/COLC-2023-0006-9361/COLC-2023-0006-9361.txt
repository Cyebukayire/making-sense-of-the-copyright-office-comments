Artificial intelligence is essentially an algorithm tasked with taking mass amounts of data and creating something based on averages. There is no artistic intent, no original idea, and nothing that can be copyrightable. Because AI art needs a prompt to make it, the value assigned to it is only as much as the prompt itself. A prompt can&#39;t be copyrighted, so neither should the artwork.
