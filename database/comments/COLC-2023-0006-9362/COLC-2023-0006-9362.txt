Artificial intelligence is neither artificial nor intelligent. They are computer programs that &quot;scrape&quot; (steal) websites for input and develop predictions from the original works. When attributions are not given (difficult from a mixed dataset) and the original artists have neither consented to this use nor been fairly compensated, the work should not be copyrighted.<br/><br/>There might be an edge case for individual artists who input ONLY their own work to create some hybrid work.  Such cases should be examined carefully.<br/><br/>Collaborations and work for corporations (like Disney) should not  qualify.
