As a published author, I&#39;ve been involved firsthand in conversations regarding AI in my industry. I am adamantly against AI-created content within the arts. New tools have popped up allowing anyone to &quot;create&quot; a novel in seconds, and similarly with art. This will render our entire industry obsolete. <br/><br/>AI-generated content, even if partially used, should not be copyrighted. It&#39;s a different matter if someone wrote the book themselves and used AI to proofread or grammar-check. But if they&#39;re using AI to write entire passages, the book itself must not be copyrighted. There can be no middle ground on this, because once we create a threshold (say no more than 5% of the content can be AI-generated), then we are splitting hairs, and moreover, how do we obtain proof?<br/><br/>I believe AI has terrible ramifications for a large portion of society. It&#39;s the reason behind the Hollywood writers&#39; strike, and if we allow AI-generated scripts, novels, and other media to be copyrighted, then that&#39;s only the beginning of a dark society.
