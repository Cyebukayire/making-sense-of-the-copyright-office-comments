  AI may be an interesting new internet asset, however it&#39;s current powers are being abused in ways that should count as copyright infringements. The name &#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39; can be misleading because it implies that the program has the ability to generate its own unique content - it cannot. Instead it can only take the data its been given. <br/>  This data can include writing and art, which are the industries that AI have had the most impact on so far. Many industries that before relied on art can now instead put a prompt into a generator for the same result. However that generator relies on art from the internet, from real artists, to be able to generate the result in the first place. These artists are not acknowledged, nor paid. Many times they are not even aware their art has been fed into the system. <br/>  These artists, and anyone else who has had their work fed into an AI program have no protection for this form of use of their work. It is not like a child learning art from a teacher, no original works will come of this. Instead AI is more like stealing the work of another student, scribbling over it, and claiming it as your own.<br/>  Consent must be given for these types of things. Credit must be given. Otherwise these programs will continue to steal and mimic art and other forms of media that was never to be used in such a way. It will damage the need for the arts despite the fact that it required them to make its own work. There needs to be some sort of regulations on it, and some form of protection for the works it feeds off of. <br/>  Theres probably hundreds of comments like this. I hope mine can help make a change.<br/><br/>- College Freshman, Pursuing a Degree in Computer Science and Graphic Design
