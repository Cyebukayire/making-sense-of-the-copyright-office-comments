I am both a writer and a software developer. As a result, I have insight on both sides of the issue. Put directly: AI is not a human; it is a machine designed to imitate humans. Further, generative AI, such as ChatGPT and its ilk, are effectively statistical copy machines. They do not create; they only mimic. They do not author; they only mimic. They do not contribute; they only mimic.<br/><br/>Copyright secures ownership over an art. Fair use allows limited access to copyrighted works for public benefit. It does not strip owners of their rights nor does it give carte blanche to blatant imitation. AI, especially generative AI, only produces imitation. It is designed to imitate. Which, when relying on copyrighted works, translates to being designed to steal.<br/><br/>AI (aka brute machines running software) are not humans and do not have rights. Fair use allows a human access to a work. Since it is not human, the machine has no &quot;fair use&quot; rights.<br/><br/>AI owners will assert that the material is only used to train/teach the machine and that the material is neither kept nor replicated. While I do not concur, pretend they are correct. Using copyrighted works without permission and without fair compensation is equivalent to stealing a class from Yale or Harvard. They are implicitly using writers with immense skill and training to teach. They did not ask for these writers to teach their machines. Nor have the writers granted permission. That the teaching comes in the form of those writer&#39;s works of art does not change this fact. In effect, these companies are stealing private teaching time from highly skilled human creators. Can a human teacher freely copy and pass out entire copyrighted works, without permission and compensation, to their students? Then why is it Ok for AI&#39;s owners to do so?<br/><br/>Fair use doctrine does not and should not grant rights or access to copyrighted works for use in training AI programs of any kind. Such should be allowed only after securing proper permission and paying appropriate compensation.
