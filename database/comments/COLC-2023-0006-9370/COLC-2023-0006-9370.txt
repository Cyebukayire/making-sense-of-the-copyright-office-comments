Artificial intelligent (or AI) generated content that is produced by using other copyrighted or other pre-existing source materials should not be allowed to be copyrighted. Copyright should exclusively be limited to human-generated content. Even though there is an argument to be made that the creation of the AI algorithm is created by humans, and that the input to the AI to create content is crafted by humans, the actual output is based on algorithmic computations using other sources of content, many times from copyrighted sources that were not licensed for such use. Those algorithmic computations do not generate original material in the sense of a musician mixing pre-recorded samples creates a new piece of music; it is a difference of intent to create something new vs. generated content calculated to be the closest match for an algorithmically based solution. Current AI is solely reactionary to input, it has no initiative of its own to create new, original content.<br/><br/>When true AI that has self-determination and initiative is created, then copyright should be considered for their output. But that day is likely a decade or more away.
