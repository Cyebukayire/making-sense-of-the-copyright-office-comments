As a creative individual who likes to share art and writing online, I am extremely perturbed by the lack of protections websites offer their users to protect their work against being used to train AI. These skills take years for a person to develop, and I hate seeing examples of AI spitting back out near replicas of someone&#39;s own hard work. As a consumer, it is also extremely frustrating to know that some people are using AI to write and publish books in an effort to make a buck, but do not put in the effort to craft a story themselves, do not credit the author whose work heavily shaped the final product, or even publish guidebooks with blatantly false information. I would much rather my dollar support an artist than someone using an AI.
