It is my opinion that the amount of AI-generated work that should be subject to copyright is so extremely limited as to be nonexistent. <br/><br/>First, the purpose of copyright is to encourage and protect the creativity and production of new ideas. An author, artist, etc. will not produce if their ideas are stolen and reproduced without constraints. The work they have put in will have no possibility of reward, so they will stop. AI has no such restraint; once an algorithm is trained, the effort expended to &quot;create&quot; art is minuscule, and if copyright is afforded, the possible reward great. This goes against the spirit of copyright. <br/><br/>Second, it is my belief and understanding that AI is trained on all &quot;available&quot; sources, regardless of copyright holder. Therefore, all AI-generated art should be considered derivative. While it is possible to profit from derivative work, there must be a significant change. I do not believe that AI changes the source material sufficiently to be considered new material; more than that, utilizing another creator&#39;s copyrighted material without consent or purchase violates copyright. <br/><br/>Third, as a point to the third, it cannot be understated the impact even the early stages of AI art and writing have had on the artistic and authorial communities. Frequent rumors of AI-bot scanning have been found; full copies of work are found created and sold by AI. The internet has become a place to freely share art; AI will kill that. All art will be created only when under the strictest controls, if at all. AI will kill truly original art, especially if given the same protections as human artists. <br/><br/>Do not allow AI to have copyright protection. An algorithm is not an artist.
