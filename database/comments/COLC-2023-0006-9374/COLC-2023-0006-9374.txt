I have spent literal years of my life working to hone my writing craft in hopes that I could one day do it as a full time career. Thousands of pages, months of editing. To see all of that be laid to naught because anyone could steal my ideas and finish it in seconds with AI genuinely makes me nauseous. AI should not, and cannot be called original content, because is is scraped off the bones of human made works and repackaged under a shallow shell. If there was no human made works to train the plagiarism software that has been given the semantically satiated misnomer of &#39;AI&#39;, then the &#39;AI&#39; would not exist at all. And all of these have been trained off of innumerable artists&#39; stolen works. To allow that &#39;art&#39; to be copyrighted would be to kill any hope in any artist anywhere for a life in art, it would destroy the livelihoods of artists in Hollywood, in publishing, in writing, and anywhere else where human creativity was once held sacred, but is now being desecrated in exchange for higher and quicker profits for the one percent who see artists as nothing more than a bump in the road towards another 0 at the end of their bank balance. Please do not allow this, and let the souls and hopes of millions of artists live on against the face of a bleak outcome.
