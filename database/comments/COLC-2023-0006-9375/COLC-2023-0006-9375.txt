Hello. I would like to make clear that the current model of AI generators is tantamount to plagiarism and theft. Therefore the use of this technology without the consent of and fair payment of the subjects the AI was trained on should be legally banned.<br/><br/>The AI in its current form operates by scanning a certain group of copyrighted movies, tv, and scripts, swallowing it, and defecating out AI art without crediting or compensating the artists who actually made it. <br/><br/>Allow me to give a practical legal example of how these AI generators are theft. If someone were to enter &quot;cartoon mouse&quot; into one of these image generators it would create something that would look a fair deal like Mickey Mouse. If someone then attempted to sell that image on t-shirts, Disney&#39;s lawyers would sue them into oblivion. It would be obvious theft of IP. Why is it any different is someone were to type in &quot;Star Wars sitcom&quot; into an AI generator? it would be stealing the IP of Star Wars and of whatever sitcom the AI has been trained on. <br/><br/>In its current form, these AI generators only serve to destroy the jobs of actors, writers, and countless others through blatant theft. <br/><br/>I sincerely appreciate you listening to me and hope that the government will act swiftly and decisively to destroy this high-tech theft. <br/><br/>Thank you
