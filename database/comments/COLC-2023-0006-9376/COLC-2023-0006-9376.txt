There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time. While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI. To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.<br/><br/>I believe artists and writers should give consent and receive compensation to be included in an AI training set, and images and writing resulting from AI should not be eligible for copyright without significant further human manipulation/improvement of the generated image.<br/><br/>I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in this topic and its request for public feedback.
