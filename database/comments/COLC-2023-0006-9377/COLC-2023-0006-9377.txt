Thank you for opening this important question to public feedback. I believe that works should not be able to be used for artificial intelligence training without the consent of the creator/copyright owner. The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training. Thank you for considering these comments.
