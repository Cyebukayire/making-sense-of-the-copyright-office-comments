I do not think AI works should be subject to copyright.  AI cannot produce anything -- writing, sound, visual art -- without first being &#39;educated&#39; by scraping the existing works of human artists and creators, and this is usually done without consent.  Furthermore, it is easy to see how corporations may take advantage of AI against the interest of human creators in their employ in the future.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>A concerned educator and frequent hobby writer
