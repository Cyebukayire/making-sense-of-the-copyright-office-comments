No, AI-generated works should not be copyrightable.  Creating is a uniquely human process, and at this stage, the only thing so-called &quot;AI&quot; systems can do is cobble together something that looks like something else.  There is no creativity involved, and frankly, no effort.<br/><br/>One: &quot;AI&quot; is a misleading name.  There is no question that it&#39;s artificial, but there is zero intelligence involved.  They are merely complicated photocopiers and word-mulchers, no more.<br/><br/>Two: The creative difference between telling, for example, ChatGPT &quot;Write 4000 words about fishing on Lake Erie&quot; and actually sitting down and writing 4000 words about fishing on Lake Erie is as vast as the difference between making a Xerox of a picture of the Mona Lisa and actually painting the Mona Lisa.<br/><br/>Three: Most of the &quot;AI&quot; systems out there are trained on material that is not public domain, be it art or writing.  This is nothing less than violating the copyright of the original creator.  Just because something is on the internet does not mean that it is free to use.<br/><br/>Four: &quot;AI&quot; systems cannot identify whether they are providing accurate information or not -- see the case of the attorneys Peter LoDuca and Steven Schwartz in New York, who allowed ChatGPT to write filings for them, and ChatGPT simply made up legal citations that *looked* real enough but turned out to be completely fictitious.  The program pattern-matched random text to simulate citations that looked like other legal citations it had processed.<br/><br/>Copyright is reserved for creative work.  So-called &quot;AI&quot; systems do nothing creative.  They simply follow pattern-matching rules, and a simple human prompt just isn&#39;t enough to qualify it as a creative endeavor.  In no way should these works be eligible for copyright protection.
