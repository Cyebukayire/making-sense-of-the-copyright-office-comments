Thank you to the Copyright Office for seeking public opinion on this contentious topic.<br/><br/>I am a full-time software engineer pursuing a Masters in Artificial Intelligence. At the same time, I am a supporter of all who dare to make a living as an artist in any form, and of those who share their creations as a hobby.<br/><br/>The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.  This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.  Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright.  I think that the Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to consult the public, and for considering these comments.
