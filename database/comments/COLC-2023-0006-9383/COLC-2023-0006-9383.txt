The product of generative AI can only exist if the technology consumes and regurgitates existing work; generative AI cannot come up with an original idea, or any idea at all. Therefore: 1) Individuals whose work was used to train generative AI should be generously compensated and/or be allowed to opt out of having their work included in the portfolio that feeds this technology. 2) The work of generative AI should not be possible to copyright because it is not original work.
