AI is a cheapened average of work human efforts have created. This process of creation takes time, effort, the development of skills such as a critical eye for editing, understanding the audience a work is intended for, along with a multitude of others. Using AI to &lsquo;create&rsquo; is bypassing all of these skills to get to a result that will never be as good as it might have been.<br/><br/>The above isn&rsquo;t even considering that the &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo; AI develops is most often derived from work that is used without informed consent or credit. So not only are the results not as good as they could (and should) be, it is literal theft. A person put in the time and effort, and someone else is reaping all the profits from it.
