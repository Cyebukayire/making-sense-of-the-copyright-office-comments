I do not think that AI-generated works should be able to be copyrighted unless the data that the AI in question was trained on, has legal permission to use all of the artwork or writing included in that training set. Especially if the AI-generated result is intended to be used for commercial purposes. <br/><br/>The AI-generated work is impossible to generate without a data set, unlike humans who can draw inspiration from existing works. If the person has permission to use everything in the data set, then sure. But if they don&#39;t, then they should not be able to copyright the result. It is unfair to every artist or writer included in that data set when something is used to take their works without permission and then profit from them. Especially as AI-generated things are beginning to threaten the livelihood of artists and writers and other creators.  <br/><br/>Overall, I do not think AI-generated works should be able to be copyrighted unless certain fair conditions are met.
