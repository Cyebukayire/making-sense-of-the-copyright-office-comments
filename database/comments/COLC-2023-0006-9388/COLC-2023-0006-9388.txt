I don&#39;t believe works created solely by AI should be allowed to be copyrighted because it removes the human element from the process. I also don&#39;t think works generated by AI from data pulled from art that has copyright protection should be allowed to be copyrighted- it&#39;s not infringing on the other work&#39;s copyright because it was changed and is derivative, but it&#39;s still derived from a data set that is legally troubling to profit off of.
