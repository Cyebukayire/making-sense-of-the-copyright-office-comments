I do not believe that AI art, writing, or creations should be copyrightable. Not only are they trained off of many people&#39;s work that did not consent to have it scraped, there is no reason why AI should hold copyright or create things that can be copyrightable. You should only hold copyright to AI work that was trained on things that you yourself created.
