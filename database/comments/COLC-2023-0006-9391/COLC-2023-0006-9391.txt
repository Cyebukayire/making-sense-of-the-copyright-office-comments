Regarding whether generative-AI-created output (text, images, or equivalent) should be copyrightable: I would argue that they should not, for two reasons. First, while &quot;creativity&quot; is a slippery concept to define, I don&#39;t see how prompting a generative AI exhibits the minimum level of creativity necessary to be legally recognized and protected. (One could make an argument that the prompt could be copyrightable, if it meets the usual standards of originality etc.; but that&#39;s a different question.)<br/><br/>An argument could be made that generative AI is analogous to an artist who creates a device that incorporates stochastic methods to produce art. I don&#39;t believe that the analogy holds up, however, because the artist has a creative intent behind both the device and the ultimate artwork. In the case of generative AI, the developers of the AI model are, typically, different than the users of it, and do not have a specific artistic intent behind creating it.<br/><br/>The second reason -- and I believe that this is a valid reason to consider when deciding what law or regulation to make -- is that social harms will come from allowing generative-AI-created work to be copyrighted. Not only will it impact the livelihoods of many, many writers and artists -- which is not a small consideration -- but it will replace human-created content (which may be good or bad) with uniformly bland pablum, since that is what the models are trained to produce.<br/><br/>The other question, however, where I think copyright law applies is that the major models -- ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and the like -- were trained on vast bodies of data found on the internet without the permission of the creators. Copyright law currently does not enumerate &quot;may be used to train a generative AI model&quot; as a distinct right that copyright owners may grant or withhold, because it wasn&#39;t a thing that existed until recently. I think that the law should be amended to so include that right, and it should be made clear that simply posting something on the internet does *not* automatically grant anyone else to right to use that text or image as grist for training an AI model. That right must be explicitly sought and granted for every work that is used to train an AI, and makers of AI models should be required to make available what data was used to train their model so that copyright owners can verify that their work was not used without permission.
