As an artist I feel strongly that my works should be considered fair usage for training models exclusively if I have given written permission for those pieces.<br/>In cases in which my works (or other copyrighted works) have been used without written consent, the individuals responsible for the selection of my works to be used as training (or organizations responsible for the individuals employment and workplace conduct in relevant scenarios) should be fined for each image wrongfully used and pay the copyright holder compensation.<br/><br/>Works created by AI relying on models trained by human-made works should not be considered able to be copyrighted unless those AI-made works have been substantially and directly modified by a human.<br/><br/>Curated sets of legally acquired training data for a model should hold some level of protection. Images created by these data sets and the data sets themselves should not be protected to the extent that original works are protected. The level of protection for produced images or curated training sets should be influenced by what legal permissions the &quot;curator&quot; has been given in writing.<br/><br/>Any image created by ai should be labeled in an accessible way as having been created by ai.<br/><br/>New works created by modifying Existing work with AI should be protected for personal use except in cases in which a written agreement has been signed. For public or commercial use, these images should be under a creative commons license or similar protection.
