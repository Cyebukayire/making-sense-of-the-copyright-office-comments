AI has already admitted to theft of works not submitted by the copyright holder of art and written word. They have admitted to this theft openly and use that theft to remove actual artists from their jobs. Allowing copyright of stolen art allows corporations to get away with wage theft, copyright theft, and destroying jobs for their own greed. Written words created through AI should also not be considered able to be copyrighted as many have been created to make false books in botany and the like which requires accurate information, AI has been proven many times over to give information regardless of it is right or wrong based on what the program believes the inputted wants. This puts lives in danger if someone purchases a book believing it to be accurate only to find out at a hospital that it was AI generated.<br/>For the written word AI generated books are created from scrapped content whether Fanfiction or publishable works, if one can&rsquo;t copy and paste a bunch of lines and claim they made them then thousands of stolen work shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed either.<br/>Multiple AI programs have either openly admitted too or have been proven to have stolen copyrighted content and creations. It&rsquo;s theft that has found a loophole which needs to be closed up.<br/>For voices AI generated voices allows a single person to claim to have the right to a persons *voice*, this is terrifying for both people who make their living as a voice actor and for those who fear retaliation. If someone holds a copy right they can&rsquo;t claim something is fake to take it down because they don&rsquo;t own the copyright to it. The sooner the holes are patched, the sooner AI&rsquo;s ability to be used to steal from actual humans goes away.
