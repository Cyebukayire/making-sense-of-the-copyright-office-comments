I am not an articulate person, but the very existence of AI disgusts me. My work as an artist and self published author can be scraped and stolen and I will see not a single penny from the profits made off of a computer trained on my own work. Work that is made by a human does not just represent their own talent, but also the many, many years of dedicated study and training, and also the many lifetimes of others who have studied that same craft and passed down their observations and discoveries. To allow a shoddy computer program to steal such things and pervert them into something which is, by definition, unoriginal and comprised of stolen parts, is vile and immoral. I hope you will take my words into account when passing laws against AI being able to rampantly violate copyright.
