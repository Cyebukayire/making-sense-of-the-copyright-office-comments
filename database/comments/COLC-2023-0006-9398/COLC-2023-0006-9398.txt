When it comes to AI, I think it has the potential for many amazing uses. However, at its current stage, it has become a nuisance to creators and artists across every community. There is a glaring issue in the ways AI currently scrapes it&rsquo;s data for its learning algorithms. Most AIs scrape data from any free platform without consent to those who posted their works. Whether it be written content, drawn, or photographic. While I have not felt these effects, I follow many content creators on social media who have lost income from people &ldquo;recreating&rdquo; their content instead of paying for a commission for their work. It&rsquo;s upsetting to watch the lively hoods of some of my favorite creators be so negatively affected by their work being outright stolen to train an AI. I have a suspicion that if some of these artist were contacted before hand and paid for the commercial use of their work, they may have agreed to let AI use their work to learn. However I have yet to hear of such efforts being made while it&rsquo;s currently so easy to just steal these works instead of paying for them. <br/><br/>On the question on what amount of human interaction makes it fall under &ldquo;created by a human&rdquo;. I do not believe entering a prompt or uploading files to be scraped reach those minimums. As with photography, there is a vision to these art works. A photographer sees a scene either present before them or in their mind, and uses their tools and environment to recreate that vision. AI does not compare in that sense. Sure, someone may have a vision when entering a prompt such as &ldquo;write me a short children&rsquo;s story about pirates&rdquo; or &ldquo;create a portrait of a red haired woman wearing glasses&rdquo;, but the tools at their disposal are not being operated by the user. They are not manipulating the tool to create their vision. They are telling the tool that has been trained through coding to create their vision autonomously. This feels similar to me as just asking a creator to write or create those prompts. Which would not make the client the creator. They still commissioned these works from a &ldquo;tool.&rdquo; <br/><br/>However, I do not believe AI should have any rights over the content it produces. These works are not their own. They are algorithmic recreations of existing works. I do think that derivatives of existing works are their own works, such a parodies, or pieces inspired by others, however these are not exact copies. AI uses copies of works, while derivative art uses inspiration. If it were say traced, that would fall under the current copyright laws of infringement. So with that in mind, I believe that AI produced work that mimic a specific artist, author, or creator should also fall under that infringement. I myself am not a developer of AI so I do not know the intricate details of the process, but I do know that without copies of works, there is no content to produce. <br/><br/>The use of AI copying a person voice is truly appalling to me. I see the funny videos of cartoon characters singing funny songs, however the truth of the matter is that&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s real voice. A real voice actor with a real life. If AI is trained to make a politician say outrageous jokes, could it not also be used to make that same politician say <br/>horrendous things about a demographic of citizens? Or just straight lies about their political platform? Even just the average person can be made to say something that could ruin their reputation and potentially their whole livelihood if they rely on their voice as their job in anyway. <br/>This is theft just the same. If they would get paid for their voice work, but a company or AI developer decides to instead just produce a copy of their voice so they can avoid paying for the actor, that should fall under the same infringement. <br/><br/>I hope we come to a future where AI can be used for something great. Something that benefits the individual while not hurting creators of beloved art and prose. We are not there. In order to shape that future, the current trends in AI need to be contained and driven in a better direction than where we are currently headed.
