Since AI art is synthesized on data sets containing patterns, images, and concepts from artists who are not compensated for their works and perhaps did not give informed consent it is ridiculous that AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; would be copyright protected. Since it is not an intelligent being nor can it genuinely &ldquo;create&rdquo; anything based in original thought ai &ldquo;art&rdquo; should not be treated with any legitimacy.
