I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in public opinion on the matter.<br/><br/>I am a supporter of artists rights and am a good friend of several people whose careers are deeply affected by AI generated content. Under current copyright laws an artist has exclusive rights to their work for a set period of time, to allow this work to be used by a generative AI is exploitative. The copyright holders get to decide how their work is used and AI companies have infringed on their work hoping to become to solidified of an industry so it becomes more and more unlikely for the government to stop them, they relied on an oversight in the governments copyright rulings and clarifications to try and steal creative work and profit heavily ultimately replacing the people they stole from.<br/><br/>Friends and colleagues of mine have started making less money as artists because their clients have started a shift towards using AI content instead.<br/><br/>I believe the U.S. Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.
