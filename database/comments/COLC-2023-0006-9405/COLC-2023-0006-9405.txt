Many of the pieces created by ai is made through searching and plagiarizing others hard work. Meaning any piece created using ai is not unique or specfic to the one feeding the prompt, and thus making the ai search for more pieces to plagiarize. Not to mention, many people who do utilize the use of these ai tools often talk about ways of recreating the same piece with specific prompts, so even the end results achieved is not directly linked to the person who discovered the prompt to begin with.
