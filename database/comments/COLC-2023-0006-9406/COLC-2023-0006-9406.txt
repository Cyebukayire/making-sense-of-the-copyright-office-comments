The information the artificial intelligence (AI) uses to learn should only be content that is in the public domain with a public domain copyright agreement or owned by the company that is training the AI. If the artificial intelligence machine learning uses material that is not in the public domain, it should be considered stolen and a violation of the creators&#39; copyright protections.
