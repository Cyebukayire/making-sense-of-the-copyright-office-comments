AI should not be copyrightable, and it should only be trained on open source, public domain works. If copyrighted works are used to train an AI, that should qualify as copyright infringement or forgery in more severe cases. If an artist traces over a work and tries to pass it off as their own, or even draws something too similar to a copyrighted work, they will most often be called out for copyright infringement. Why wouldn&#39;t it be the same for AI specifically trained to copy the art styles or writing styles of certain writers and artists? AI created works by their nature cannot be categorized as new art, when they&#39;re made by computers taught off of copyrighted work.
