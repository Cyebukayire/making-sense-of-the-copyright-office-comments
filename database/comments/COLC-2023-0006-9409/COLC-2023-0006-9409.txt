I do not believe that works created by AI should be copyrightable. I believe that the collaborative nature through which AI has been developed and the synthetic output it derives do not qualify as &quot;human creativity&quot;. The entire idea of &#39;training set data&#39; which has not been provided on purpose by the people who created it is upsetting. AI content should not have any chance to have equal footing with creative efforts of humans.
