I am a published writer, and I believe that AI &quot;creation&quot; of writing has serious risks for other writers, as well as artists in general. This comment addresses only writing-related comments, however. I have organized my comments by the numbers given to questions in the NOI.<br/><br/>1. and 2. I think the greatest risk is that AI-written webpages will overwhelm people looking for factual information with an incorrect slop, and people looking for entertaining fiction with a boring slop. It&#39;s not that I think people can&#39;t tell the difference, but time is a limited commodity, and and filtering out the slop will waste that for everyone. It will also steal income from real writers, either because they&#39;re not being hired, or because no one can find their work among the slop. And to add insult to injury, their work may have been stolen to feed the AI.<br/>3. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association put together a whole webpage of articles on AI as it pertains to writing: https://www.sfwa.org/2023/03/03/sfwa-members-weigh-in-on-ai-machine-learning-applications-considerations/<br/>9. and 10. Use of copyrighted material for training should ABSOLUTELY be opt-in, not opt-out. Amazon and other storefronts for self-published writing already have a set-up to allow the author to make choices about their work and receive payment. I think that either Amazon/existing storefronts or a new AI system should be made in which an author can upload their work and agree to let it be used in training for a given license term if they like the payment that the company offers them. If AI model makers want better training material, they should pay more!<br/>10.3. There should be a licensing system set by Congress, but it should be opt-in.<br/>13. If paying for training material makes the AI business model unprofitable, that&#39;s too damn bad. It shouldn&#39;t have been profitable by stealing income from writers in the first place. If most AI model companies go bust and only ethically trained ones remain, I think that&#39;s what&#39;s best for writers and the public.<br/>15. Records should absolutely be kept so that there&#39;s a paper trail if someone chooses not to opt-in and has their work used anyway. Maybe it could be retained on a central website so writers could check their name every so often.<br/><br/>Thank you.
