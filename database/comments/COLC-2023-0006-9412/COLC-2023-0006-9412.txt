I am a television writer and member of the Writers Guild of America, currently on strike in part due to the threat to my livelihood and my entire industry by so called &quot;Artificial Intelligence.&quot;  If corporations are allowed to copyright content generated by AI, they will immediately shift to cheap and derivative content from the AI platforms and will do everything they can to avoid paying the artists whose century of work was collectively used to train that AI platform.  <br/><br/>It will be the end of a major American export, the stories we tell on film and in television.  It will be the end of America&#39;s cultural influence on the rest of the world.  And consumers will suffer without new content.<br/><br/>It has taken many many years of hard work and experience to get to where I am in my career.  And while I do not believe that a more sophisticated autocorrect will ever be able to master the art that is writing and producing for television, I recognize that soon it may be able to generate something that looks like a Teleplay to a layperson.<br/><br/>A studio could hypothetically use AI to generate something they know to be useless for actual production.  But they would use that material as an excuse to decrease the compensation a human being would be paid to take that generated &quot;idea&quot; and create a piece of writing that could actually serve as a blueprint for a film or television series.
