Ai art is more often than not a learning machine that has taken art from actually artist who work hard to master their craft. The Ai is not the villain, the user of it who wants to make a profit off a learning machine that&rsquo;s stealing work is the villain. It shouldn&rsquo;t be protected cause a person just clicking through to &ldquo;find&rdquo; the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; image is not the same amount labor used as making one&rsquo;s own art and honing the craft of it. It would not be fair for a ai creation to be held in the same protection as the same work as Winnie the Pooh, SpongeBob or even specific art because it would diminish the work done by artists. If you don&rsquo;t want your job done by an ai why should an artist job be done by one? Most answers to why it should is because companies don&rsquo;t want to pay artists or people don&rsquo;t want to wait for a commission to be done but they&rsquo;ll wait for a low quality Ai to spit out the &ldquo;desired work&rdquo; of a commission but not a person. It&rsquo;s selfish. People don&rsquo;t want to have themselves be replaced by robots or ai but an artist is allowed to be replaced because they don&rsquo;t view them the same. For we forget that we are easily replaceable as well as the human artists we view beneath us.
