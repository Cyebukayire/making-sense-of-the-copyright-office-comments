I think that using copyrighted materials to train AI constitutes copyright infringement. I have seen many examples of AI-generated art pieces that recreate a copyrighted work almost fully, in such a way as would constitute copyright infringement.<br/><br/>I believe that neural networks should train on public domain works or works for which a license has been paid for, allowing the scraping of data and the training of an AI on that data.<br/><br/>I also believe that not treating this (training an AI on copyrighted material) will lead to a deleterious outcome on the creative sector. If one of the intents of copyright is to ensure that creators (of art, novels, music, medicines, etc) are able to profit off of their creations and thus continue to create, then allowing AI to spoof these works will lead a devaluation of compensation for human creators, disincentivizing them from creating more original material (which will lead to a dearth of material for AI to scrape, leading to less creation overall).<br/><br/>Thank you for your time!
