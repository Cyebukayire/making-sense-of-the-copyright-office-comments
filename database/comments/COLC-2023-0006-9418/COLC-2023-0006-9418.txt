I support the current status quo, where AI work can be be protected by copyright only when it is part of a larger work with clear and significant human authorship, and where wholly or even just mostly AI generated works without clear and significant human authorship - something more meaningful than just the training data and prompts fed to the AI system - cannot be protected by copyright law.  This framework preserves the use of AI as a new tool in the hands of human creators, as with the innovative use of AI technology in the Pixar film Elemental.  At the same time, this framework remains true to the underlying purpose of copyright law which justifies the legal imposition of a temporary artificial monopoly in the first place - namely establishing a financial incentive to encourage and reward the production of new works by human creators.  AI engines do not require, and indeed are incapable of responding to, such financial incentives.  Worse, extending copyright protections to AI works are likely to have the effect of discouraging the production of new works by human artists, working to the exact opposite of the purpose of copyright law.
