AI is a useful tool if utilized well. It can be used to visualize concepts and streamline work.<br/>However, I don&#39;t support the collection of creatives&#39; (musicians, writers, artists, etc.) work and using it to train these models (e.g. Midjourney) IF CONSENT IS NOT GIVEN. It violates the creator&#39;s right to own their works.<br/>The use of AI also cheapens the hard labor that the creators put into their work.<br/>Permitting free usage of AI means that creators will struggle to find jobs in an already oversaturated and highly competitive market.<br/>If AI must used to produce something, I believe it should be law that it be stated clearly and be visible on the product. This would let the public remain informed about what kind of content they are purchasing, and if it supports human creatives or if they are purchasing a product that was generated by a machine.
