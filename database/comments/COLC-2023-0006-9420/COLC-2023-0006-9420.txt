I don&#39;t believe AI should be allowed to file copyright claims. I don&#39;t believe something made by an AI that trawled the internet looking for the average answer should be eligible for copyright. I don&#39;t think AI being given free rein would be fair to artists, programmers, writers, singers, actors, voice actors, dancers, politicians, most if not all government agencies, and anyone who wants to post a selfie and keep their clothes on. There is already a browser extension that uses AI to detect and censor pornographic material, and if it can go one way, it&#39;s entirely possible to go the other. <br/>AI generated media MUST NOT have ANY legal precedent in a courtroom. None. I believe this for the simple reason that if it is allowed, there WILL be audio recordings, pictures, and video recordings  of both sides that would lose them the case, reducing the entirety of the justice system to a popularity contest of &quot;who didn&#39;t make their opponent look bad enough&quot;, specifically because AI can be made to do ANYTHING. It might not do it well, but it will do it. <br/>In terms of copyright law, anything made by an AI MUST be inadmissible for copyright, trademark, or patent. Why? Because in the case of copyright, the AI can be proven to have stolen art from sources outside the public domain, and even if it can&#39;t, that would mean all of its sources had come from the public domain, making it ineligible for copyright. The same stands for trademarks. I find it unlikely at best that an AI could come up with a patent, but if it could, how could it be proved that someone else had not come up with the idea first, and then had it taken from them to you by the AI or beneficiary thereof?<br/>Therefore, I say AI and copyright are like solid metal potassium and water. They should be kept far from each other everywhere outside of a controlled environment.
