AI-generated material that is trained on the work of individuals who did not consent to their work being used for said training should not be copyrighted. Furthermore, AI-generated material was not made by a person, but by a program putting together various pre-existing works it gathered based on prompts a person gave it. It does not have the capacities to properly fine-tune or edit material the way human eyes would. This can lead to misinformation of AI just throwing together articles, as well as copyright infringement of people using AI to mimic specific art styles.
