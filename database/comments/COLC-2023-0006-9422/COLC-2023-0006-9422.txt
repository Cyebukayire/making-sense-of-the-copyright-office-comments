To who it may concern:<br/>As someone who has written as a hobby, written those works in google docs, and published those works publicly, I firmly believe that AI work should not be able to copyrighted if the creators of the AI generator did not obtain permission and fairly compensated the original creators of their sources for their work. This is something that has been coming for other fields such as artists and voice work. There have been flagrant examples of people using AI to create work with prompts such as &quot;Portrait in (Insert Artist&#39;s Name)&#39;s Style&quot; or &quot;Voice this Dialogue in (Insert Voice Actor)&#39;s Voice. These generators and their content can easily be used to create content in a similar style to an artist or even with someone&#39;s actual voice which can hurt that voice actor&#39;s or artist&#39;s ability to gain work. Going back to my own field, I am very worried about how not only my publicly available hobby writing has been used for data set for an AI Writing generator. Even once I publish my first novel, I am concerned with if someone will take my book for such a purpose. Even if your work is not being used directly for such purpose, AI content is also being used to profit off of authors such as in the case of Jane Friedman having books uploaded to Amazon under her name https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/10/tech/ai-generated-books-amazon/index.html What that article doesn&#39;t say is that Jane Friedman had to go to X formerly Twitter to complain about her problem to her fanbase and even gaining the attention of a law firm before Amazon actually took any action in removing those books. As per the article, other authors have also said that their fans have told them about buying their newest books only to find it is someone else who generated a book via an AI text generator to convincingly match the author&#39;s style. It is  of vital important for the US Copyright office to protect the rights of everyone in creative industries as these AI generated images, audio, and text continue to be used for impersonation and cutting creators out of future work by using AI generators that have been trained with data that were taken without permission.
