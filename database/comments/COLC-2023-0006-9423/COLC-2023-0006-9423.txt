I do not believe that AI outputs should not have the protections of human authorship. The products are entirely derivative, using art, text, and video that actually are created by people, usually being used without the creator&#39;s permission or knowledge. Due to the fact that the products contain no element of human authorship (save for the stolen works of other creators) I cannot reasonably believe it deserves any copyright protection.<br/><br/>Perhaps in the future this question can be addressed again if things change drastically enough, but for now? Absolutely no copyright protection.
