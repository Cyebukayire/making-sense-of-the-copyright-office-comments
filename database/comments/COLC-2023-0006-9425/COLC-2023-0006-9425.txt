As an editor and person who works with created content, I support the rights of humans and their unique ability to create over a machine that amalgamates, corrupts, and steals the works of those humans without crediting or transforming sufficiently. This form requests that I confirm I&rsquo;m not a robot, because the words of humans matter while the words of robots are generated and meaningless. Consider laws decided by an amalgamation of past decisions. No civil rights movement. No women&rsquo;s suffrage. Let&rsquo;s not put art in that position.
