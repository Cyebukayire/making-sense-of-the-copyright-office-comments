AI work should not be protected under copyright because, as AI content generation stands now, it has already flown in the face of copyright protection as a whole. The general public was never asked for consent until it was already too widespread to feasibly stop. As such, I believe art, music, etc. created by AI should be exempt from copyright protection, and entered into public domain by default.
