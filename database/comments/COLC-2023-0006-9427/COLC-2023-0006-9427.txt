I don&#39;t think that corporations should be allowed to copyright things created by AI. AI is often trained on works that have been stolen, and don&#39;t have the copyright owner&#39;s permission to use. Large companies, where people are posting things, like Facebook, or Instagram, or Twitter (currently known as X) etc, are now changing their terms of service to say they can utilize everything that&#39;s posted to train AI, which frankly is a gross violation of the copyright owner&#39;s rights. I would hope that the copyright office would protect the copyright owners&#39; works, and stop large companies from profiting while utilizing stolen data.
