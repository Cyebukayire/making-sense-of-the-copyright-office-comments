The question of whether AI work should be copywritable is a question of the purpose of copyright. Is it to protect the intellectual property of human beings? Or is it a tool for corporations to assert control of the media landscape without having to pay anyone?<br/><br/>AI can generate outputs far beyond the productivity of what humans can manage, what is to stop a corporation from automating the generation of an incomprehensibly huge content library of art and writing, publishing it to their own site, and then sueing real people whose creations happen to have similarities to the generated content? <br/>This isn&#39;t even touching on the matter of how unethical the data harvesting for training AI models is. <br/><br/>Our society(and economy) are deeply unprepared for the Pandora&#39;s box that is automatically generated content, and to grant them more rights and protections at this time while artists and writers and struggling is cruel and tone-deaf pandering to tech giants over real artists creating some of the most important aspects of human existence.
