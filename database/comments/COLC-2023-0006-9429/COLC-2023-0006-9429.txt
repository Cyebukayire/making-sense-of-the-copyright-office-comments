The use of AI greatly concerns me, as I worry about having my data breached by AI scraping that could be allowed by companies. For example, what if Google allowed AI to train from Google Docs, at a price? Intellectual property and privacy is very important to me, because without security my data could be sold to the highest bidder without my knowledge or consent. The ability to collaborate through the internet and share unprecedented amounts of information can and will be compromised if companies allow AI to train on copyrighted and personal, private works. I am already concerned about the AI tools that already exist that have been trained using stolen data, since the companies seem either unwilling or unable to return the stolen material. The theft remains permanent, and the ideas and talent that went into creating an original piece of artwork is uncredited, unearned, and stripped of its unique value by this replication.<br/>As a consumer, I would like to know what works are created with AI, and how much AI input these works received. I would like to know how that AI was trained, since the material AI &quot;learns&quot; from is the actual source of whatever the AI creates.<br/>If AI depends on the input of humans, namely the works it&#39;s learned from, then those humans own the copyright of the work, and the person using the AI generator is commissioning it. They may have a clear idea in their mind of how the work should look, but they are still not the artist and creator, and cannot hold the copyright.<br/>If you argue that AI is transforming the works enough that it&#39;s distinct from the original human creations, then this alteration is being done by the AI, not the person typing it commands. The AI, as a non human entity, cannot hold a copyright.<br/>In every case AI generated material cannot and should not hold a copyright, and allowing such a copyright to exist would allow creative theft on an unprecedented scale as people copyright and profit off the works of other artists and writers and creators.
