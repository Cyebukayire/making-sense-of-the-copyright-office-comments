Anything made by AI shouldn&#39;t be considered to have any protections under the law, which includes copyright. In addition, nobody should be able to profit from this work or call it their own. Any sort of AI art, literature, music, etc. is solely made by robots. At best, this work is wholly fake, and at worst, it is nothing but theft as it is all created through references from stolen artwork, usually with no request sent to or consent given by the original creator(s). Thank you for your consideration
