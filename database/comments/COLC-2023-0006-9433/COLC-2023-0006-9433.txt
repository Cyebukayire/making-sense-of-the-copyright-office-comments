Things made by AI (artificial intelligence) can be interesting. However, this comes at a cost for artists and other creators. For example, a person might use an AI website to create a piece of art.  That piece of art isn&rsquo;t AI: it is normally a combination of lots of creators&rsquo; art. I believe that AI art should be used for personal or educational use, as long as the individual who generated it doesn&rsquo;t claim it is theirs. In the future, if there is a way to credit every creator&rsquo;s work that shows up there, they should receive credit. Copyright is an extremely important thing. Without copyright, people may not want to share their work. Sharing work has led to publishing, which has led to thousands of loved creations around the world. AI should not be able to take that away from people.
