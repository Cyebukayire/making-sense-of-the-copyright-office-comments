This does not create new materials, simply bastardized current materials without the explicit consent of the original copyright holders. AI created items have nothing of value because the thoughts and intention of arts is what is the valuable part, not just the final product. If AI is allowed to be copyrighted it is first of all stealing from original IP holders, as well as creating massive job loss not just in the United States, but around the world, putting more straight on current welfare systems. Please do not take our passions, hard work and jobs from us. Allow us Humans create arts the way we have since the dawn of mankind, with our hands.
