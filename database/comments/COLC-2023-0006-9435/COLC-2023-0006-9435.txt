Artistic work produced by artificial intelligence is really just a collage of other artists&#39; work, remixed together. While I think riffing on others&#39; work can be a form of expression and homage, to do so without properly crediting and compensating the original artists whose work trained the AI is simply theft. We do not consider a Xerox machine&#39;s reproduction to be a new work created by the machine because it was fed the original. AI is similar, and copyright law should reflect that to protect the people who use their talent, imagination, and uniquely human brains to create... without fear of that work being stolen and plagiarized. Thank you.
