I feel very uncomfortable about the current state of AI development.  It is my understanding that AI art copies from existing art without prior permission from the original artist, and many artists that I know have reported fewer commissions since the usage of AI art generators became widespread.  Usage of free or low priced AI art generators causes the work put into original art pieces to become devalued, which brings to mind the current cultural attitude towards the arts (i.e. the current need for a writers strike being brought about by the current mistreatment of those working in the entertainment industry).  Furthermore, on the side of academics, AI has been used for academic dishonesty as well as the unintentional spread of misinformation.  <br/><br/>Obviously fair use laws make the usage of copyright material for AI training purposes tricky.  As someone who isn&#39;t involved in the AI production industry I do not have the technical knowledge to know whether or not it would be possible for an AI to &quot;unlearn&quot; copyright materials that were used in the training process.  As an outsider I believe that it would be best to limit these programs to public domain works, though I have fears that using them to train AI generators would undermine the original character of the work.  The best solution that I can think of would be informed consent (in which AI creators would need explicit permission from the creator of the original work or the creator&#39;s estate to use a piece for AI training purposes) but even then it is clear that the usage of AI art in the first place has undermined the value of artists and many are concerned for the future of traditional art.  AI developers should be legally required to publicly disclose which works were used for training to ensure that they received permission to use works for training purposes, thus allowing those who did not opt in to pursue legal action.
