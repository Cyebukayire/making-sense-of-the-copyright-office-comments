AI-generated art is dangerous to the livelihoods of individual creators and artists working in creative industries. These programs are trained directly off of the artwork of people who did not give permission, nor transfer any copyright rights, to allow their work to be trained off of. These programs do not behave the same way that a human does; it does not have a brain or the capacity to &#39;take inspiration&#39;. And it also does not take the effort a human does to create its art, and does not have the actual knowledge to understand concepts it was not directly fed. You can make the argument that it&#39;s impossible for artists to become null at the hands of AI art because people will always appreciate art that is handmade, but this argument does not work in a society run by capitalism. The fact of the matter is that artists are losing their rights and losing opportunities for jobs due to AI-generated art. From fine art contests with money prizes being won by AI submissions to companies like Disney and Netflix using AI to make animation at the expense of their workers. There is indisputable proof that artists are losing out in the industry to AI-generated artwork that was made from the very art they created and shared online in the past.<br/>With that being said, everything here I mentioned affects artists on an individual level. Many artists do not have the power or money to file a lawsuit against a large corporation who is discriminating against them. I think it would be disadvantageous and create a class system if you only enforced laws against AI-generated art on a lawsuit basis.
