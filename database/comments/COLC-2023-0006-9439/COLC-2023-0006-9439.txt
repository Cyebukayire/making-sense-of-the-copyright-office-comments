Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment.<br/><br/>I am an author as well as a supporter of authors and artists, and recognize that it is important in a democratic society to support the creation of art. As such, I feel that it is highly unethical to allow AI to be trained using material that is copyrighted or used without the creator&#39;s express permission.<br/><br/>Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution. In addition to this, the Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.  This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.  Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the creators whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.
