1. While potentially beneficial for ease of creation to all involved, use of copyrighted material or other systems of theft without consent and the design of these tools being intended to phase out creators altogether creates a hard negative on the idea of using them in any copyrighted work. If a system is fed with stolen material, not only should it not be copyright protected but it should be taken down as infringement. However if everything fed into the algorithm was done so with consent by original creators and the result has been agreed upon to be used for financial or other purposes in which copyright is necessary, it should be allowed.<br/><br/>2. Yes, as a vocalist it makes me very concerned that my voice can be taken without my consent and recreated without me being able to prevent it though legal action.<br/><br/>4. Algorithms should be fed only with content which has been given express permission by original creators alongside financial compensation, credit, or whatever else is agreed upon between a company producing an ai and the original creator.<br/><br/>5. Absolutely, see section 4.<br/><br/>6.1. Through scraping via algorithms trained to do so, I would say the vast majority of material is gained in this way as it&rsquo;s an automatic process.<br/><br/>6.2. Constantly and without limit. Oftentimes these materials are stolen wholesale with no regard for the original creators and without compensation. To my knowledge these works can mostly not be copyrighted but the systems themselves shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to be kept up.<br/><br/>6.3. Public domain works and non copyrighted material are used for ai training to their fullest potential though they make up a minority of the total. I see this as fine as that&rsquo;s why public domain exists but few if any companies or developers actively commission work when theft is an option.<br/><br/>6.4. From my understanding yes they&rsquo;re stored, in what ways I don&rsquo;t know.<br/><br/>7.3. Put simply, no.<br/><br/>7.4. Not to my knowledge.<br/><br/>8. Under no circumstances would this be fair use.<br/><br/>8.2. This should be seen as an accessory to copyright infringement or a perpetration altogether.<br/><br/>8.3. If done for a commercial nature no material used in training should be copyrighted or used without copyright holder consent via contract on an individual level.<br/><br/>9. Affirmative consent to opt in should they desire along with an ever present ability to opt out.<br/><br/>9.1. All uses.<br/><br/>9.2. Any processes that were trained on data in which a copyright owner opted out of this use should be held as copyright infringement, though I don&rsquo;t have expertise enough to say if there&rsquo;s a way to detect this short of having publicly viewable data banks.<br/><br/>9.4. The data trained on the content of said objection should be removed and the company or people behind said ai should be held as if they&rsquo;ve committed copyright infringement with the full legal repercussions therein.<br/><br/>9.5. Yes, and under the same system as copyrighted material under assumed copyright.<br/><br/>10. Through the model&rsquo;s owners contacting a creator or copyright owner directly and working out a contract with them on an individual level as one would with use of copyrighted works.<br/><br/>10.1. Yes, and if a situation arises in which it&rsquo;s not then the ai simply may not use that content under any circumstance.<br/><br/>10.2. Both feasible and desirable. <br/><br/>10.5. No<br/><br/>15.  Yes to both.<br/><br/>15.1. Original creator, source of intel, the intel itself, as much as possible to collect.<br/><br/>15.2. Disclosures should be made to anyone who requests them.<br/><br/>15.3. Publicly available lists of third parties and full responsibility alongside said third parties for any breaches that may arise due to their use.<br/><br/>16. Full obligation to disclose this to them and allow them to opt out, failure to do so should constitute copyright infringement<br/><br/>18. Yes if the trained content was not copyrighted and the user gave the needed commands.<br/><br/>22. No. <br/><br/>23. No, it should be founded based on both the content it was trained from and substantial similarity to another work.<br/><br/>24. Irrelevant as the model should maintain said records or be taken down under possible infringement. It is up to these companies to maintain said records to prevent infringement.<br/><br/>25. The party that owns and operates said model alongside whichever party owns and operates the system that collected the copyrighted work of applicable. The end product should be destroyed if need be. <br/><br/>28. Yes if the user agreement of said AI requires it so based on agreements made between the original material makers it&rsquo;s trained with and the company who owns it.<br/><br/>28.1. The end user or via watermark automatically applied with the creation<br/><br/>28.3. This shall fall under breach of user agreement, the work should be destroyed or copyrighted under the artists behind the original material.<br/><br/>32. Without explicit permission of the artist they&rsquo;re imitating this should fully constitute copyright infringement.
