AI software tools like ChatGPT and Mid-Journey are plagiarism at their most fundamental level. These engines are trained on copyrighted or owned material, created by third parties who have not provided consent for the use of that material, have not been appropriately compensated, and often have no knowledge that their material is being used. The AI engine then processed, mixes-and-mashes together words, patterns and phrases, and concepts to create an idea that still has strong connections to copyrighted material. To allow AI products to be copyrighted sets a dangerous precedent that would erode the meaning and legal strength of a copyright.<br/><br/>How long would it be before people can use the argument that a screenplay, book or song they &quot;wrote&quot; used AI, so that&#39;s why it strongly resembles another work? If you allow corporations to use AI as a tool to create copyrighted material, the US Government will be setting a dangerous precedent that defeats the purpose of copyright laws. <br/><br/>In addition, we must also weigh the impact legitimizing AI has on humans and our jobs. If AI tools can be used to create copyrighted material, then any job currently creating copyrighted material will disappear in the next decade, if not sooner. Millions of people will see their careers and livelihoods disappear overnight, replaced by robots that are making this material for free. And anyone who wrote material prior to 2023 will never see a cent for any material they made that was used to train the robots that replaced them. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I ask and beg of you to ban the use of AI in the creation of any material that will be copyrighted. Please do not let corporations steal our work, violate our copyright and avoid paying creators what we are owed. Please protect the American worker and honor the spirit of the laws that give us the right to own our own work. Thank you for your time.
