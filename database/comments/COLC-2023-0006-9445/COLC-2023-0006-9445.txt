AI generated artwork and written work should not be eligible for copyright. Images and words created by a computer, means that work is not created by a human. Inputing prompts and asking it to make something for you is a far cry from creating the work yourself. There is also the issue that AI machines have been fed work that is under copyright without the permission of the copyright holder. There is no way to know if what the computer spits out is part of a work that is already under copyright. <br/><br/>Granting copyright to work that has been fed a few lines of input is a slap in the face to all artists who use their own skills to create unique works.
