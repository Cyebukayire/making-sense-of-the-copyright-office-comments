It is plagiarism and theft to train AI on material from human artists (writers, visual artists, directors, etc) without their explicit consent. It undermines copyright laws. My work is not in the public domain! And the use of it as such is a legal loophole that these companies are exploiting for their sole profit. We are standing on the precipice of a turning point in human history and your action or inaction on this matter will have a lasting effect on generations to come. I urge you to stand with your fellow humans and help us protect ourselves and our work.
