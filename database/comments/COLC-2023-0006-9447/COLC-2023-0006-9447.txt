Content created with AI should not be considered copyright because it was not created by a human being, unless one of the following is met:<br/>If the AI collection was done using the art of 3 or fewer human artists, it should be under the copyright of those individuals.<br/>If a high enough percentage of the piece was created or modified by a human AND the changes are covered under the existing definition of &quot;transformative&quot;, that artist would hold copyright under existing fair use laws.<br/>AI training sets should be considered copyright, and should be both publicly accessible and subject to existing copyright laws. Media used to train an AI without explicit permission by the existing copyright holder should be considered in violation of copyright law. However, any image generated using these data should not be considered copyright material unless it falls under one of the two categories stated above.<br/>Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for accepting public feedback.
