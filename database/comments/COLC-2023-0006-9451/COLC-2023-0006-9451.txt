Artificial intelligence should not be used when it comes to being an option for writing services. As a television writer who has written for iconic series such as Tom &amp; Jerry, Snoopy, Sesame Street and more, I worry about the jobs that could be at risk due AI. Writing is a job unlike any other as you bring pieces of yourself and lived experiences to everything you write. AI has no lived experience and is just taking bits and fragments of other (already copy written scripts) to use for its own Frankenstein repurposing without crediting the original work or author nor is it compensating the author or owner of the work financially. This is a clear copy right infringement and cannot be allowed to thrive without a major overhaul and examination. Thank you for your continued investigation into this.
