I appreciate the Office&rsquo;s interest in this topic and its request for public feedback. I support authors and artists, and feel that it is important in a democratic society to support the creation of art. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo; Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating authors for the right to their writing is inconsistent with the Constitution. Protection of intellectual property is a cornerstone of American democracy and economy. The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act. <br/><br/>&quot;No part of this publication may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, or stored in a database or retrieval system without the prior written permission of the author.&quot; I believe allowing AI to &quot;read&quot; and train itself on copyrighted material would violate those terms.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.
