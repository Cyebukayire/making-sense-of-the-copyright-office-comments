As Federal Judge Beryl Howell ruled two weeks ago, AI art lacks a human author, and is therefore ineligible for copyright. Extending copyright to AI art would logically open it to copyright of a bird&rsquo;s nest or an anthill. While these works are created, a human, even a human who owns the animal in question, cannot claim authorship for the piece, nor can it be reasonably said the animal was hired for the piece, as it has no concept of ownership, creation, or payment. The same holds true if not truer for AI generated art, which, in addition to lacking any kind of coherent mind and therefore any true creative process or ability to understand an offer to work, is not paid for its work, and cannot possibly receive a payment that it could in any way value. Unless Artificial Intelligences can be somehow verified as truly intelligent, which would require measurement systems that do not currently exist, it is absurd to allow their work to be copyrighted.
