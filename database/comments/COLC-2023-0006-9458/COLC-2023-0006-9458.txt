Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment. I am a supporter of authors and artists, and recognize that it is important in a democratic society to support the creation of art. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Permitting generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings is inconsistent with the Constitution. Additionally, I find it morally reprehensible for any corporation to use an individual creator&rsquo;s hard work and craft so as to make money off of it in an artificial and dehumanizing way, whether or not the creator actually has legal copyright. As such, I firmly believe and would ask that the Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act. Thank you for your consideration on this matter.
