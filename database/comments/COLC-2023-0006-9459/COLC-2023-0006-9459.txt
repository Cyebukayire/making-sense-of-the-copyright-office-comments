I don&#39;t think the products of artificial intelligence should be copyrightable. One of the key components of art is creativity, and for all of human history creativity has been a uniquely human domain. This investment of intellect, refined skill, and raw emotion is what makes some of the greatest works of art so noteworthy. <br/><br/>Allowing AI-generated art to be copyrighted allows for the corporations who own those AI to pump out cheap art pieces by the thousands and starve out genuine human artists. Our nation and culture is defined by the art we create, art based off the myriad of human experiences and emotions that artists draw upon in the act of creation. Artists also practice their craft for years or even decades to refine their art, a significant investment of personal resources on their part. Allowing corporations to flood the market and public consciousness with soulless mass produced &quot;art&quot; allows the very soul of our nation to be copyrighted and sold, and if we allow that then we lose something very fundamental as a society. <br/><br/>From a more practical standpoint, many of these AIs are trained on art samples from human artists and writers. An argument could be made that they aren&#39;t truly creating anything; rather, they are just recreating a pattern based on the works of human artists. Allowing AI art to be copyrighted allows for the copyright holder to indirectly profit from the work of human artists without fairly compensating them. <br/><br/>AI artwork should not be copyrightable. Let the public use AI, sure, but since prompting an AI to make something isn&#39;t the same as actively creating art then whatever the AI makes should stay uncopyrightable public domain. Art is more than images and sounds- it&#39;s emotion and soul, and its something computers still haven&#39;t been able to mimic.
