I do not believe that AI-generated content should be granted any of the benefits of copyright, nor do I believe that the developers of AI should be able to copyright any product of AI. If a person(s) were to copy, via more traditional techniques (painting or sketch, for example), AI-generated content, I would then support their claim to copyright. I am principally concerned that a person or group with enough computing power could seek to generate a great deal of content, using only broad themes or vague keywords, and thereafter be able to claim many independent works as being in breach of copyright, effectively coming to have control over these themes. Human effort must be the measure.
