I am a professional television writer, and rank and file member of the Writer&rsquo;s Guild of America. I&rsquo;ve written on multiple hit television shows and have been writing professionally for nearly eight years. I have devoted my lifetime to studying and honing of my craft, years upon years spent writing countless screenplays and short stories. All in pursuit of furthering my abilities as an artist and storyteller. I have pursued the economically tenuous life of an artist because I believe that storytelling is a fundamental part of our human experience. It is how we make sense of the world around us. It is one of the things that makes us human. And writing, contributing to that larger tapestry of human experience, is both my connection and contribution to this world. <br/><br/>I applaud the protections that US Copyright law has afforded writers like me. I would not have the career I&rsquo;ve had without it. Because it means the work I do, as a human writer pouring his blood, sweat, and lived experiences into the stories I create, has value. And that value, and my fundamental ownership of it, has given me the economic life I have &mdash; modest home ownership and a middle-class lifestyle raising my three little girls. In short, something once called the American Dream.<br/><br/>And it is because I am so grateful to the Copyright Act that I am so abhorrent of everything the AI companies have done. Trampling copyright protected material during their LLMs training runs without a care or concern in the world. They want the economic sweat off my brow, my creative labors, along with millions of other writers, artists, and designers just like me, without having to pay a cent for it. <br/><br/>They apparently think that because their technology moves so fast, they aren&rsquo;t beholden to the same copyright restrictions that others are. Well, those restrictions exist to protect artists like me. <br/><br/>And what AI companies like OpenAI have done, using the &ldquo;corpus of the internet&rdquo; as training data sets for their LLMs is piracy and digital theft on an industrial scale. <br/><br/>And to what end? I&rsquo;ll tell you &mdash; to further enrich their VC and private equity backers. At the expense of people like me and my family. <br/><br/>I find it disgusting. And abhorrent. And the fact that they are now seeking to extend copyright protections to the pale facsimile of creative work that these LLMs call writing is only a further example of their unrelenting greed. <br/><br/>I&rsquo;ll end it here with this plea &mdash; please re-affirm the need for HUMAN authorship in works afforded Copyright protections, go after the AI lawbreakers for criminal copyright infringement with everything you&rsquo;ve got, and don&rsquo;t kowtow to the Sam Altmans of the world and their false-headed gods of &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and &ldquo;progress.&rdquo; Because those are just buzzwords to mask what they really want &mdash; to extract value from human creators without having  to pay for it.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
