Because generative &quot;AI&quot; (including stable diffusion models, language learning models, etc.) are trained on existing work, the rights of the creators of that original work should be considered significantly. I base this belief on the idea that these models, lacking the capacity to think, much less do anything with intent, cannot create an output that is meaningfully transformative. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to police the creation of datasets used for training these models. As a result, I believe that, unless the specific dataset is provided and the holders of the rights of the works in the dataset are confirmed to be compensated fairly (I know nothing about how this could be done broadly, so my instinct is to allow individual rights holders to determine what is fair for them, but perhaps this could become able to be abused by large organizations), if these generative AI tools are used in the creation of a work, the submitter of the copyright application should not be able to obtain a copyright for it unless actual transformative changes have been made to the work in between AI generation and copyright submission (in which case the original AI generation should be submitted for proof alongside the submission.<br/>To end my comment, I would like to reiterate that the part of my comment that is most important to me is that it is extremely difficult for users of widely-available generative AI tools to know what dataset generative AI is trained on, unless an individual creates the model themselves. I believe work produced by an AI trained on these large datasets cannot be fairly claimed to be original work of the submitter due to the inextricable influences of other works, in a purely moral sense. To apply this to the law, I believe that this could possibly be viewed as a trade-off: using an AI tool without care for the dataset it pulls from will lead to a work that is unable to be copyrighted. I hope the Copyright Office decides on a solution that will protect the creators of works used in these datasets.
