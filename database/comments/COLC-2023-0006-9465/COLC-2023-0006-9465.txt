AI is already destroying artists careers. <br/>The entertainment industry is on strike thanks to AI yet I know companies in other fields that are still considering replacing their talent with plagiarism (AKA AI) <br/>Our hard work is getting stolen by these AI softwares and then being used to replace us!..<br/>Artists barely make enough to survive and now we have AI that is taking the crumbs away from us. <br/>What&rsquo;s more despicable is that even the art software we have to use (because they&rsquo;re industry standards) have been caught stealing artists&rsquo; art and feeding them to their AI machine ( I&rsquo;m talking about Adobe). We pay adobe membership fees, we use the software and in return adobe got caught stealing art and feeding said art to their AI. <br/>CEOs are already replacing talent with AI. <br/>When will the government wake up and regulate this? <br/>AI is plagiarism scam that is heavily marketed towards greedy CEOs to replace actual human workers. <br/>They make money off of our hard work while we lose our jobs to them. <br/>If AI is allowed to exist the way it&rsquo;s operating right now then we no longer have copyright laws. <br/><br/>
