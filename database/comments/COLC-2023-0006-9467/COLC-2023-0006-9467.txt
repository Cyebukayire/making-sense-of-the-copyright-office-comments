Legitimately, I find this trend of imitative/recombinant software to be really really worrying as an artist, even though I&rsquo;m just an amateur. Online art spaces I once frequented have been thrown into absolute disarray as a small new contingent of folks - people looking for training material for their generative &ldquo;AI&rdquo; programs - immediately and remorselessly perpetrated a ton of straight-up theft by feeding peeps&rsquo; artwork into their training data. Like, back when, people would get up in arms if your character looked too similar to theirs or you cribbed one of their poses and layouts. lots of people thought that was kinda silly because folks reference things or find the same sources of inspiration or whatever, but you can kinda see where the accusers were coming from when people in their sphere of awareness were basically lifting certain details wholesale. But this AI thing is so egregious because your whole catalogue gets fed into the wood chipper for reference and the best you can often find is an &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; feature. And you sometimes don&rsquo;t get a say at all?? Because even when there are protective measures these AI folks will just scrape the data anyway? It&rsquo;s just a scary time to be online for people who produce their own content. It&rsquo;s also a scary time to be in a work force when corporate employers decide that both visual and text-based roles can be filled by &ldquo;AI&rdquo; with astonishingly little foresite and no regard for the high likelihood of inaccurate info or plagiarism. I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m so tired and I feel like people with more money or fewer principles are always moving the goalposts, and I can&rsquo;t stay safe or be certain that my communities will remain intact. I&rsquo;m sorry.
