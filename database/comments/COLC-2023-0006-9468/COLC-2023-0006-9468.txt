I believe AI generated content should not be able to be claimed under content law as it relies on machine learning from multiple people who may not have consented to having their craft used in the learning model, and this not only devalues the hard work the person put into their work but removes the need to create and floods the market unfairly with cheap &lsquo;art&rsquo; that makes it so artists and creators can no longer create meaningful pieces, since the odds of those being used to train a for-profit ai who can vastly undercut them makes ai a legitimate threat to the creative process of humanity in general
