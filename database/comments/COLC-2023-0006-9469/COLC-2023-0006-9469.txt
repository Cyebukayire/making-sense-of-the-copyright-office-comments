AI &quot;art&quot; is by definition not original.  It is at best derivative and at worst theft. The bots are trained by stealing copyrighted images and overlaying them.  While this might be classed as fanart - fanart is also not copyrightable. It&#39;s fair use which is non-commercial only. <br/><br/> Even if you put that aside, the is created by the computer/ AI not a human who just typed a few words.  Therefore the only entity who would, in theory be eligible to claim copyright would be the computer.  The computer itself - not the corporation who wrote its software or host its databases.
