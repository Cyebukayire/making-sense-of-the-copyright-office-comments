AI-Generated Works Should Not Receive Copyright Protection, and Training AI on Copyrighted Material Does Not Necessarily Constitute Infringement<br/><br/>Arguments Against Copyrighting AI-Generated Works<br/><br/>Lack of Human Authorship: AI-generated works do not meet the U.S. Copyright Office&#39;s criteria of being the &quot;fruits of intellectual labor&quot; rooted in human creativity. This aligns with the guidelines set forth in the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices.<br/><br/>Originality and Creativity: AI-generated works often lack originality, a key requirement for copyright protection as emphasized by the U.S. Supreme Court in Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.<br/><br/>Ownership Ambiguities: Copyrighting AI-generated works would create a legal quagmire around ownership, complicating the application of traditional copyright laws.<br/><br/>Potential to Impede Innovation: Granting copyright protection to AI-generated works could stifle technological progress by introducing legal barriers to AI development.<br/><br/>Arguments Against the Notion that Training AI on Copyrighted Material Constitutes Infringement<br/><br/>Transformative Use: The use of copyrighted material to train an AI model could be considered &quot;transformative use,&quot; a concept upheld in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music. This could weigh in favor of a fair use defense.<br/><br/>Absence of Specific Intent: AI models, being non-sentient, do not have the intent to create derivative works. This lack of intent could be a factor in determining whether copyright infringement has occurred.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>Based on existing U.S. copyright law, which emphasizes human authorship and originality, AI-generated works should not be eligible for copyright protection. Furthermore, the act of training AI on copyrighted material does not necessarily constitute infringement, especially when considered under the lens of transformative use and the absence of specific intent to infringe.<br/><br/>Sources:<br/>U.S. Copyright Office, Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition, 2017<br/>Feist Publications, Inc., v.
