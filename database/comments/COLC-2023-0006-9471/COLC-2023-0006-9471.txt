Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment.  I am a supporter of authors and artists, and recognize that it is important in a democratic society to support the creation of art.  There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.&nbsp; While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.&nbsp; To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.  The Copyright Office should adopt positions finding that training generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors of those works violates the Copyright Act.  Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.
