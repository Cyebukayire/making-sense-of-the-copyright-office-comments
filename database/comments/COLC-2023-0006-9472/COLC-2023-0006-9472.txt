Thank you for your time. I would like to state my general dissatisfaction with artificial intelligence (AI) and believe that ALL AI should not be able to be copyrighted. Allowing AI material to be copyrighted will flood the world with inhuman garbage, further removing any chance for the average person to pursue a life of art and creation. This will also remove any possibility of competition between entities because the largest and richest entities will be the only ones with access to extremely powerful AI. These powerful AI will be able to flood the copyright system claiming all that they create. This will slow the copyright system down to a grinding halt.<br/><br/>I work as a voice over artist and already we have been seeing jobs stolen by AI, causing a race to the bottom. While humans have a limit of how little money we can live in society with, AI does not it can always go lower.<br/><br/>AI is not perfect. It was created by humans who have their own flaws and those flaws are distorted and exaggerated as AI is trained on more and more flawed data. The data used is flawed therefore the AI is flawed. This creates issues especially in instances of government surveillance and police intervention. Facial recognition software already causes false positives without the use of AI. With AI, this problem will grow to the point of allowing a computer program to arrest individuals.<br/><br/>All information, unless explicitly purchased from the individuals it represents, is stolen. This information has been scraped from websites and databases without permission. Entities will do this without permission and the only way to stop it is extremely heavy fines, unless they are hurt it is simply the cost of business.<br/><br/>The further use of AI in any instance harmful to life and should be destroyed for the safety of mankind.
