Artificial Intelligence is *plagiarism* software, plain and simple. It is based on programming requiring a human to enter works of writing and art, originally created by humans, so it can create nothing other than a facsimile. It also has been, and will continue to, take away human jobs. It has been killing the Broadcasting industry for 20 years, with corporate greed making automation commonplace--which eliminated overnight and weekend jobs, where newer broadcasters could cut their teeth and hone their skills and become the best they could be, and now, without that training, the quality of Broadcasting--by young, inexperienced, not-allowed-to-be-creative broadcasters--has drastically gone down. This has made it, consequently, harder to find advertisers and therefore, support itself as an industry. Look at grocery stores--how many self-checkouts are there? These have been slowly proliferating over 20 years, also. If there are 8 self-checkouts at your favorite grocery store--that&#39;s 8 people who used to have jobs.  The Entertainment world (Writers Guild, and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Radio &amp; Television Artists) are fighting the use of A.I. so that the use of human&#39;s likenesses is not recorded and abused and un-compensated, in perpetuity. People must be paid for their work.  Computers cannot replace humans. 100 years down the road, after decades of not being able to work, earn a living, feed, clothe and house ourselves, because a handful of rich Corporate overlords in Politics, Computers, Automotive, and Entertainment industries decide to cut costs with computers to do those jobs--who will be left to rule over, when humanity dies out? END A.I. and VALUE HUMAN PEOPLE, HUMAN LIFE, HUMAN CREATIVITY, HUMAN WORK, HUMAN EXISTENCE.
