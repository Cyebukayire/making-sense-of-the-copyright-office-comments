Although the code of an AI is incomprehensible to humans, AIs seemingly incorporate some or all the work they&rsquo;re trained on into their code. This means that the AI itself is a copyright violation, if trained on copyrighted work without permission, just as an ordinary program would violate copyright if sections of its code were lifted from a copyrighted program.<br/><br/>AIs often generate things that are blatant copyright and trademark violations, too, because of how they&rsquo;ve stored this material. You can generate images with well-known logos and sections of writing that clearly plagiarize multiple consecutive sentences with minimal rephrasing.<br/><br/>Unless it can be proved that the work was generated with an AI that was not trained on any copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright holder, the work should not be copyrightable.<br/>
