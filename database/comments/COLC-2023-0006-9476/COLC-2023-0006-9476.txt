I am a screenwriter and proud member of the Writers Guild America. I am currently on strike over this issue, and as a sci-fi and speculative fiction writer, I have done my research. I am also a person, an artist, and a huge fan of art that other people have made.  For years, we have been told not to make copies of movies or music or art for our own enrichment. We certainly cannot SELL the copies of movies or music or art. Even times where another artist has only taken a tiny part of someone else&#39;s art - say, a still photograph taken from a movie, or a sample from a song - you do not have the rights to do so without explicit permission from the creator of the art. To encourage generative AI without strong protections is tantamount to sampling our work as writers and artists for the ongoing greed of studios who prioritize profit over people. Generative AI software should more rightly be called exactly what it is - plagiarism software. Plagiarism has never been allowed - especially for the financial benefit of the plagiarizer. So why would it be suddenly okay now? <br/><br/>As a reader, writer, and human - I have learned from the work of other artists who have gone before me. I have studied their work, learned from it, and grown from it. But that is NOT the same as hundreds and thousands of scripts and movies being fed into the maw of an endlessly ravenous large language model, to be stripped to bits and processed through a predictive algorithm that can spit out &quot;possibilities&quot; for a story.  <br/><br/>If we allow this plagiarism of work that writers, musicians, artists and actors have truly worked for on a human level - if we allow their creativity to be swept into a &#39;dataset&#39; for future generations, we are abdicating our responsibilities as humans, and as artists. We are choosing algorithmic answers over the deep work of wrestling with the world we have today. That is not simply taking a shorter route - that is cheating. (Crossing the finish line of a marathon does not count if you drive 26 miles, then exit your car to run the last 500 steps of the race. Running a marathon means you put in the work, and the training, and you run every single step yourself.)  <br/><br/>For generative AI companies to use our work to train their AI models to one day spit out &quot;art&quot; is plagiarism, plain and simple. It is stealing. It is cheating. It is taking the deeply human drive to create and imagine - and handing it over to machines + machine learning. It is allowing generative AI companies to profit from our work, and destroy our future. Please, I urge you to make this kind of theft illegal. It devalues the life&#39;s work of thousands upon thousands of writers and artists - and condemns us to a future where we only look to the past of what&#39;s already been created instead of looking forward to our future.
