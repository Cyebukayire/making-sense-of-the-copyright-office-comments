Generative A.I. uses the content created by other artists as the basis for it to generate something else, whether it is a written document, novel, script or an image like a photograph or video or even a song or lyrics. It cannot generate anything on its own without the uses of other people&rsquo;s work&hellip;work that was used without the original artist&rsquo;s approval. In music when someone &ldquo;generates&rdquo; something based off of other people&rsquo;s work, it&rsquo;s called sampling and they are need to be financially compensated. When Generative A.I. &ldquo;samples&rdquo; people&rsquo;s work, how could they be compensated? They can&rsquo;t and therefore that work should not be shielded by a copywrite. It&rsquo;s generated from someone else&rsquo;s work.
