The usage of AI when it comes to the creation of something (writing, illustration, animation, etc) should not be be protected under any form of copyright. When it come to the process of creation, a person(s) is the one creating it and that is the most important fact about that. When an AI generates an image or a block of text, there is no human involved in the process of making it. It isn&#39;t even an Artificial Intelligence. There is nothing intelligent about how it behaves or moves, it is simply a machine learning algorithm that is making a guess on a prompt its given based on other images its been shown. No person made it, they simply point to a bunch of randomized pixels or words and say that they did.
