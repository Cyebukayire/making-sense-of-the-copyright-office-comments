I do not believe that AI-generated images, scripts, or anything should be granted copyright because algorithmically predicting what word comes next or algorithmically photo-bashing are, by design, uncreative processes. Instead of making creative decisions, AI uses data that it is (likely illicitly) trained on to make an educated guess at what goes where. There is no intent, only data-driven guesswork.
