As an author married to an illustrator, I believe that &quot;training&quot; a LLM on copyrighted material is theft. Programmers pretend that the computer is learning just like a person who looks at art or reads a story, but that&#39;s crap. You don&#39;t look at the Mona Lisa and then paint portions of it into other artworks. You don&#39;t read a book and then write portions of it into your own story. That&#39;s theft and plagiarism. Data sets that trained on ANY copyrighted material without the rights holder&#39;s permission should be illicit and any artwork/text created with AI assistance should be uncopyrightable. Anything less is permission to steal.
