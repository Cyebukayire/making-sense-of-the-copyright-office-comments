I find it exceptionally appalling that people are attempting to use other humans&rsquo; work for their own gain. Art, especially, should be human and other people should not be able to profit off of artists who have put in the time to learn a craft and then to be treated as artists themselves.<br/><br/>AI should in no way be treated as a unique practice and should have no rights to copyright, as most AI artwork is essentially stolen. We&rsquo;re not talking about predictive texts or suggestions, computers that follow code and copy assets as instructed. We&rsquo;re talking about people using programs that have &ldquo;learned&rdquo; from authors and artists and then pretend that they themselves have accomplished something when what they have done is used the stolen talents of others to make themselves appear talented.<br/><br/>This is unacceptable and I deeply hope that the copyright office steps up to denounce these practices. It needs to start from the top-down, because large corporations are hopping on the bandwagon of stealing from artists and writers as well, largely underpaid and clearly undervalued craftworkers.<br/><br/>I appreciate your time in reviewing this. Thank you.
