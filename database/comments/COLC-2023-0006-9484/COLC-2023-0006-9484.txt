It is of importance that individual ownership of ones own work, and the right to use and sell that work as one wishes stays intact. The right to the protection of ones own work, is vital for this to apply. Currently, as it stands now, AI works produced by programs created by companies such as OpenAI or DeepAI should not have the same rights as individual works. The simple reason for this, is that these programs use training data that is owned by others, and most certainly do not count as simply tools. If you&#39;ve used an image or story AI generator, you would understand the simple fact that it is much more than a tool. It&#39;s as simple as typing three to five words and having an entire work spat at you. A work that is made from a mass of other, actual artists works. The main question is whether these programs are simply tools, and will say, with one-hundred percent certainty that they are not just tools. Photoshop is a tool, a paintbrush is a tool, spell-check is a tool. But the most important part of these programs that we accept now as tools, is that they do not use others works. A paintbrush is manufactured, but it does not steal the motions of an artists hand, spell-check uses a word bank, but these words are language, and are not owned by anyone. AI images, written works, music, and especially drawn or painted art as it currently stands, should not be able to be copyrighted. If someone generates something using AI it should be owned by none, and especially not the company that owns the AI that generates it.
