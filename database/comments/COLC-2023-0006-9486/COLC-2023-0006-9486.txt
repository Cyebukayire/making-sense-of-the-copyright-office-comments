It is my opinion that AI generated works not be viable for copyright protections. There is a significant risk of AI potentially removing any sort of human element from creative works, such a thing would be tragic as human creative expression is one of the hallmarks of our species. AI generated works should not be eligible for copyright in order to disincentivize the use of AI as a replacement for human works as well as incentivize the continued development of human made works. Careful regulation will be necessary to ensure a positive outcome in the future of AI, and critical attention must be paid to any decisions that have the potential to destroy human potential for the sake of bowing to an algorithm.
