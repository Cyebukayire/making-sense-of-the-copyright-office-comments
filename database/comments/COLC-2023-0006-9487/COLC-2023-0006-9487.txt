During the last months, ai &bdquo;art&ldquo; has become more and more of a thread for artists. Back in the days, when this wasn&rsquo;t a thing, humanity always spoke about how ai will make our lives easier. How it will do the hard work, so we can be more creative. What those people in 2023 have done to us is inexcusable. Art is something wonderful that should be made by humans for humans, there was never a problem with that. With ai &bdquo;art&ldquo;, people were trying to fix a problem that never existed in the first place. It&lsquo;s hurting us real artists, as it steals our work without permission. Ai &bdquo;art&ldquo; and open source ais should be banned completely, as long as it steals from us and doesn&rsquo;t even give us any kind of compensation. I don&rsquo;t want to live in a world where the robots are being creative and the humans have to do the hard work.
