I think that creatives should be asked for their consent for their work to be used to train AI. And that if they don&#39;t consent, their work isn&#39;t used. I think creatives should have control over how their work is used, and be paid for their work. I don&#39;t think AI should be trained using creative work that has been taken without asking and without permission of the creative who made the original work.
