I find the event of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to be comparable to the Industrial Revolution - a period of global transition of human economy towards more efficient and stable processes. <br/>However, AI will affect many more aspects of our working lives than manufacturing. <br/>What is more, AI affects the creative industries in ways that bring into question the issue of copyright. <br/>I believe that copyright exists to protect the intellectual property of individual creators, meaning the person or persons who are the original creators of works. Artificial Intelligence, as we currently understand it, does not create anything original per se, but rather takes what is available on the internet, i.e. original works, which are likely subject to copyright, and puts all these ideas together to create something &#39;new&#39;. Nevertheless, this &#39;new&#39; work contains essential elements of the original copyrighted works it gleaned from the internet, whether that be audio, video, image, text, or others, and is therefore nothing more than an extremely complex and technologically sophisticated form of plagiarism.<br/>Therefore, nothing that is created by AI can be deemed to be original and, by default, nothing that is created by AI can be deemed to be copyrightable.<br/>Moreover, I would push for international agreements, or even legislation, that would require all works created by AI to be labelled as such.
