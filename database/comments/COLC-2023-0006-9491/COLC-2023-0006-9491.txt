To Whom It May Concern,<br/><br/>As a United States citizen I believe that AI in all its forms should not be protected by copyright in any way whatsoever. To even call Amy technologies that exist today AI is misleading at best. AI tools do not produce new content, but recycle existing, often stolen, content made by creators and infringing upon those creators&rsquo; copyright. AI is not capable of independently learning from its mistakes. It is not capable of producing any form of art without someone else&rsquo;s works, and it implicitly requires eliminating the human creativity necessary to create a copyrighted work.<br/><br/>Under no circumstances whatsoever should so-called AI works be protected by copyright and to do so would be a grave disregard for actually copyright protections and a declaration that copyright is in fact meaningless. Copyright law can not, should not, and must not protect AI works.
