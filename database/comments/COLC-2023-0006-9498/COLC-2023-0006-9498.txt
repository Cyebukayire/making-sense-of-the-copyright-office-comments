The user of Articial Intelligence, it is currently implemented, relies on the hard work of actual people which, in many cases, were acquired without the knowledge and/or consent of the original media producer. Using &quot;training data&quot; from actual visual artists and writers and then having an algorithm produce similar content should not be trademarkable. This would allow the producers of the A.I. algorithms to trademark content based on someone else&#39;s works which doesn&#39;t seem at all fair.
