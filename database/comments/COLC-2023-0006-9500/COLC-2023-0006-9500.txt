Hello,<br/>My name&rsquo;s Branden Blowey and I work as a game developer in the industry. Over the past year AI imagery has gone from something eventually in the future to rapidly evolving in the present. While the technology for it has been impressive and has many uses, at the end of the day how AI imagery is made is a form of making a collage of already existing material, same goes for written AI. Making a collage of copyrighted images does not escape copyright infringement. AI in its current form cannot make something from nothing, and needs to use its database of high quality work to create a good result. The problem comes from this database pulling from everywhere on the internet without a filter for copyright or fair use. It doesn&rsquo;t account for if the image it&rsquo;s adding to the database is Woody from Toy Story or a Clipart of a star, both go in without any oversight. This was one thing back in the research phase when the technology was being developed, but now that AI models are starting to generate revenue from their databases of stolen, copyrighted work and artists livelihoods are in question it shouldn&rsquo;t continue as it is without regulations in place. In its current form AI art should not be able to be copyrighted due to this collage process and greater transparency is needed from these tools as to what images they&rsquo;re collaging from. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
