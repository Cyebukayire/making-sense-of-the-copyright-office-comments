I have learned that social media companies are using my posts and my photos to train AI, and other companies have used my content to do so without asking my permission or compensating me. It&#39;s high time that all of us whose content has been used to train AI without our knowledge or consent be compensated. AI companies should also have to request consent. If creators don&#39;t give their consent, they should have to remove the information generated by that user. If they can&#39;t they should be shut down.
