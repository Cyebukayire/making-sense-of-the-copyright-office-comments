Hi,<br/><br/>I don&#39;t think that AI material should be copyrightable when all it&#39;s doing is chewing up and spitting out other people&#39;s work. If we allow it to be so then no one will ever pay an artist or writer ever again, and then what&#39;s the point of copyright in the first place? <br/><br/>I&#39;m a graphic designer, but not one in an industry that&#39;s currently being threatened by AI generated art. What upsets me more is the idea of artists, writers, and even just anyone putting a picture or writing on the web potentially being able to be copied and sold. As it is right now if I post a picture of myself, I own that picture, and a company can&#39;t use it to pretend I&#39;m a customer or to sell images of me. If they do, I can go after them. But if AI generation grows more mainstream, they can just say, hey, we didn&#39;t steal this picture-- we just accidentally generated one that&#39;s the same! But this one&#39;s ours.<br/><br/>Then they own my face, without me doing anything at all.<br/><br/>It&#39;s terrifying.
