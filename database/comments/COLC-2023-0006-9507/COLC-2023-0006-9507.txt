AI as a technology is amazing with what it can do, but it is very important to begin deploying it ethically into the world or we could be setting an extremely dangerous precedent for the future. What has happened here is, AI companies like midjourney have been trained using images that they do not own or have any rights to, which is basically stealing your work, to replace you.<br/><br/>If the follow the same kind of mindset, we could be looking at a scary future. Please do the right thing and ban these apps until they get proper permission from artists themselves and do not allow companies to slyly change their policy to fool artists into giving up ownership. Thank you for hearing our concerns and I really hope you make a solid decision.
