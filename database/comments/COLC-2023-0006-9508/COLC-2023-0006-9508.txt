Drawings should definitely still be considered copyright able, but that isn&rsquo;t that far fetched of an idea. Should text be copyright able? Immediately the answer is yes, but why? AI learns from massive amounts of data that influence its output, but don&rsquo;t humans learn the same way? I have heard that when writing people has this invisible signature, and it&rsquo;s the words used and the length of the words, but does AI have that same invisible signature or would it be a mix of everything it&rsquo;s learned from. Words just as words would be extremely difficult to copyright, if I write a book of all common phrases will I be able to sue people for writing those common phrases? The only time when copying becomes apparent is when data is involved, but what if 5 different companies write about the same thing? And what if the data is presented in the same way? Will they all be called &ldquo;The Original&rdquo;? Also even if the data on one article is presented in a certain way, would that still could if AI presented it in a similar way? Can facts be copyrighted? Can data be Copyrighted?
