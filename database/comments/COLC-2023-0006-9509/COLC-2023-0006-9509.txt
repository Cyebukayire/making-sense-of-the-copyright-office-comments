AI generated content should NOT be copyrightable. <br/><br/>The engines generating this content are frequently trained using unknown mishmashes of copyrighted and uncopyrighted works, often including many sources that do not even wish to be in the training materials. As such, allowing copyright of these essentially ill-gotten gains would be like allowing anyone who can produce a knockoff Coach handbag to copyright that design. <br/><br/>Furthermore, copyright should be reserved solely for humans in general. AI-generated material simply should not be eligible. No one wants to live in a world where the computers are doing all the &ldquo;creative&rdquo; jobs and we&rsquo;re all stuck as the low-pay workers packing boxes for Amazon. This is basically the antithesis of the dream of automation.
