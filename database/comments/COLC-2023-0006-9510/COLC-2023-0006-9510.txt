The use of AI to &quot;scrape&quot; images as training data is problematic for artists who need to have a public presence and advertise, but also make their living from the art they create. AI companies, by skimming huge amounts of data that they do not own, are essentially creating piracy machines. While style should never be copyrightable, the methods to obtain the data used as training sets is inherently problematic in how it uses pieces created by individuals without either permission or compensation.
