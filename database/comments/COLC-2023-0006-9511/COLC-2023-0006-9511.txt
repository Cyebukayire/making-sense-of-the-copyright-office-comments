Thank you for being open to comments. I do not believe AI works should be copyrightable. AI programs are trained on the copyrightable works of humans, and if anyone should own the copyright, it should be those who (likely unwillingly ) contributed to the model. Since this is incredibly impractical, I think the best solution is to make AI &quot;creations&quot; unable to be copyrighted. This will protect the livelihoods of American artists, who otherwise stand to lose their jobs due to the cost-cutting efforts of companies. Art is a fundamentally human experience and no matter how well AI is able to mimic the appearance of art, it is ultimately meaningless and soulless. Why should my art be used to train something that intends to take my job?
