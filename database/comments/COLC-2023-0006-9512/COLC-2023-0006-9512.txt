AI Art is stealing jobs, income and opportunities from creators nationwide, even worldwide. I would prefer it if AI was not permitted to take the place of artists and writers. As a fun toy or game, it might be okay, but not if it&#39;s robbing people of a living. At the very least, AI Art should have to record itself as being created by such and not be allowed to be sold or used for commercial gain.
