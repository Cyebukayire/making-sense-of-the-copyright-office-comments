While generative AI does in fact use other people&rsquo;s work in its training data, there are more than a few elements to take into consideration. 1.) The AI does not and will not create an exact replica of someone else&rsquo;s work (unless the author deliberately makes changes so that&rsquo;s the case). The violation in copyright in that example would fall into the lap of the creator, not the generative program. 2.) While yes there are going to be bad actors as this tech gets better, copyrighting specific styles of writing, drawing etc. would not just harm the bad actors, but also every other creator. This would give corporations power to take down any art that they didn&rsquo;t like, and most creatives would not have any power to do anything about it. On top of that, specific &ldquo;styles&rdquo; of writing/drawing, have been proven time and time again to not be enforceable by copyright because it&rsquo;s far too difficult if the author did make the style the same intentionally. 3.) While I think that generative models can be incredibly powerful tools, the fact that they are trained on huge heaps of information without anyone&rsquo;s consent is worrying. There are plenty of fantastic models out there that are trained with both public domain and opt in works. In addition, it is very troubling to think about the fact that the databases that most of these generative models are trained on have been discovered to have illegal content like child porn in them. For these reasons, I think that AI databases should be required by law to either be comprised of public domain works, works that were lent to the database with the user&rsquo;s permission or both.
