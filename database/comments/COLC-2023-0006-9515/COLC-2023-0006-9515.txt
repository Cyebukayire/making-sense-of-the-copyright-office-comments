I believe that ai generation isn&rsquo;t like using tools to get a job done, but is instead closer to asking someone to make something for you. In the tool example you would still be the one making the pictures or writing the response, but that&rsquo;s just not the case with how modern ai works. If you generated a picture using stable diffusion, no you didn&rsquo;t. Stable did Sufi on made that picture and then showed you its results. The only party who can absolutely claim copyright over generated works would be the ai that made said work, and the &ldquo;monkey selfie&rdquo; case has set up a precedent that all non-human made works are considered public domain, therefore making copyrighting them impossible, let alone giving the copyright to an uninvolved party who&rsquo;s only process of creation was suggesting what to draw or type.
