Hello to whoever is responsible for reading this! I hope it isn&#39;t too tedious, or if it is tedious I hope you are paid well. <br/>I believe that usage of copyrighted materials to train AI models does, in fact, constitute infringement. It&#39;s one thing to take inspiration from a copyrighted work, but when a human does that they still have to put in effort to make it stand out and to actually create the new work from the ground up. However, an AI cannot do this. There is no actual decision making involved by the AI, and as such no actual transformation can occur beyond the most superficial appearances. Every part of the end product can theoretically be traced back to a specific piece of content it was fed.<br/>I believe that AI-generated content should not be able to be copyrighted. If it was, the results would be disastrous to a wide variety of different fields. If such a thing was legal, then all it would take would be one individual with a powerful computer to rush to generate and copyright all manner of art, designs, stories and other things while having absolutely no qualifications for doing so. It could get to a point where it would become staggeringly difficult for anyone to produce new content without being sued for infringement, as the &#39;owner&#39; could point at the randomly-generated stream and find something that matched. They themselves did not actively create or think up the content. Think of it like the &#39;monkeys on typewriters&#39; argument.<br/>I do not feel qualified to provide an opinion on how specifically liability should be held if an AI infringes on a copyright.<br/>Finally, I believe that AI mimicking of voices and styles of human artists should absolutely not be allowed, for a multitude of reasons. For one, it could be considered a form of identity theft and forgery, just with the latest set of tools. If neither of those things are  legal, then why should they be allowed by someone using AI? Second, if AI was used to generate art in any medium, then this would defeat the point of art entirely. Art is a vital part of human existence, and to automate it to a level where it could even remotely compete with human artists would deprive countless people of the ability to feasibly create art. Automation and AI is an incredibly useful tool for assisting in human labor, but the entire point of art is that it is done out of passion and enjoyment. To allow automation of that would be to surgically remove the soul from humanity. If we automate the things that people actually like doing to a point where there&#39;s even a chance they can outcompete real people, then what&#39;s the point of living if you can&#39;t do the things you love?
