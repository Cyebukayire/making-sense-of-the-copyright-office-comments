Regarding AI creativity and intelligence, it can never be truly artistic or intelligent. He can only learn from what we, humans, teach and share with it and therefore doesn&#39;t deserve to be copyrightable. Maybe the algorithm that created AI can be copyrightable but not what the AI produces. It may be working with stolen art or stolen information, and these artist and people deserve ether recognition for helping out the AI. And because of that anything that AI produces should be automatically public domain and you should be able to know from what piece of art / information said AI work was created from.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.
