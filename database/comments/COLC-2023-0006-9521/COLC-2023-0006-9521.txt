From what I have seen as an average citizen, AI is not the true artificial intelligence boasted about in movies and books. Instead the technology seems to be best at replicating previously used words or previously drawn/photographed images. To me that is not true intelligence. True intelligence means the ability to create new content, while current AI can merely replicate it. Some would go so far as to say it&#39;s actually a virtual stealing program. I would take a tamer position. I think AI is a tool, and like any other artist tool, whether it be a pen or a brush, tools can do good and bad things depending on who wields it. However all I see is people using AI to generate an image and calling it a day, not caring that the image their AI formed was made of another artist&#39;s personal work. At this moment I don&#39;t feel like an image made by AI should be copyright-able. If I imagine a photo of a waterfall can I copyright it? No because I didn&#39;t do anything to generate the image in the real world, and if I did, it&#39;s going to be exactly like a photo of a waterfall I saw previously so it still isn&#39;t mine. If it can&#39;t create anything new and original, then how could it be copyrighted?
