I believe that &quot;AI&quot; generated content should not be able to be copyrighted unless 100% of the training data is owned by the copyright holder. I have seen too many online artists be negatively affected through the unauthorized use of their work as training data, making it more difficult to get commissions. I believe that writers, actors, voice actors, musicians, and artists of all kinds should be able to perform their craft without worrying of it being stolen from them.
