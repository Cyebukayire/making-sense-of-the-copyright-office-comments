AI image generators are capable of imitating an artist&rsquo;s style if they have been trained on that artist&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;Art style&rdquo; is the primary way an independent artist can create a &ldquo;brand&rdquo; and maintain recognizability; it is how artists gather and maintain an audience, and by extension how they find work. AI image generators, then, pose a real and present danger to individual artists and their ability to find work. So I do not believe that AI learning models should be trained on copyrighted material without the consent of the copyright holder. Additionally, as the artists are the primary source of value to AI and integral to its function, any copyright of AI works should be in the name of every artist whose work was used to train the AI. Thank you for your time.
