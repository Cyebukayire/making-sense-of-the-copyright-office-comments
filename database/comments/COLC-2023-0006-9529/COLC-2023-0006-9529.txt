The use of A.I. is plagiarism. It steals the work of writers and artists to create its own, taking pieces of other work to make something unoriginal. While some artists can grant permission, the reality we have witnessed over the last year is that many of them have not, yet A.I. is still used to take from work that hasn&#39;t granted permission for use. Any development of A.I. moving forward must consider the rights of artists, writers, actors etc., whose work/likeness may be at risk of being stolen for the use of developing A.I. that may eventually deprive them of work, threatening their livelihood.
