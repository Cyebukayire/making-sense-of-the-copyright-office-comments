I have been doing moderation work for an art gallery based website for about 6 months. One of the rules we have is to not allow any generated content (what is commonly referred to as AI), or content that uses generated pieces within whatever is submitted. As part of this, a big section of my job is to remove and track this content, which allows me to get a pretty good understanding of the use case of such generated content. Overall, the vast majority of it that gets flagged is produced with intent to bypass copyright, or to scam. The reality of the matter is that there is absolutely no way of preventing AI from scraping or re-using copyrighted content. It&rsquo;s a black box; data goes in and images or text or sound comes out. I see no future where any reasonable argument can be made that AI generated media can or should be able to be protected with copyright.
