While I am not a professional artist, I follow many on social media and have dabbled in amateur art myself. The consistent evidence of copyrighted works being taken and used to train Ai is little more than theft outright, and the works generated on the backs of these copyrighted works should not receive legal protection any more than usual plagiarism and thievery would. If there existed an Ai model trained purely off the work of the individual using it, then that individual should own the copyright of the content generated, as their own work was used to create it. Likewise, works generated from content in the public domain should be public domain. Work generated using the copyrighted works of another artist should either fall under public domain, or should have copyright attributed to the artist(s) whose work was used to generate the content.<br/><br/>The easiest solution to all of this however would simply be placing all generated content under the public domain.
