As a professional screenwriter, I urge Federal regulators to ban artificial intelligence software license or copywright applications that 1) HAVE THE POTENTIAL to replace the work of human screenwriters and 2) enable entertainment conglomerates that ALREADY hold copywrighted material written by me and others as &quot;writers-for-hire&quot; to recycle my/our work using AI bots.
