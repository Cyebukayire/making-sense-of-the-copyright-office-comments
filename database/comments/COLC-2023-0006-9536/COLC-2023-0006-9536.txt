I&rsquo;m a freelance copywriter. I have worked in the business for more than 20 years. <br/>I have seen the upheaval that AI has caused in creative fields up close. For years, my bread and butter was business blogging. I recently lost two major longstanding clients for that to AI. Recently another client who has always returned over and over because they like my writing style has recently turned to AI. <br/>Instead of hiring me to work on their latest project, they ran my previous work for them through ChatGPT to generate copy with my tone and style&mdash;for free. I did not give permission for this, and I was not paid for it. The idea that clients can now hire me once or twice, like my work, and then continue to generate it for free rather than hiring me for ongoing work is more than just professionally violating. It threatens to gut my career. <br/>There are many creative career paths that sustain people and families, and that are and can be stable. AI threatens to replace all of that and displace creative workers who have spent whole lifetimes honing their skills. AI may not be able to write as well as me, but if it reproduces my work well enough, clients will happily take it for free rather than hiring me or another copywriter. The same is true for visual artists and other creatives employed in marketing and other creative fields. And the worst thing is that clients can hire us once (or find our work online), and use our style over and over through AI without compensating us.<br/>It is not just that it uses our hard work to train itself. It&rsquo;s also that it uses our hard work to replace us and suck up all the money in creative fields. AI is already replacing creatives and upending careers. So far my only defense has been to keep my clients informed that AI text and other art is not copyrightable, so they don&rsquo;t technically &ldquo;own&rdquo; that work. If that was not the case, there would be nothing stopping a client from using AI rather than hiring creatives. <br/>I sincerely hope that the patent office considers that concerns with generative AI go beyond plagiarism to income replacement. If I can have my own work and style used to replace me through generative AI, then my career becomes unsustainable. There has to be some protection for that.   If current copyright law doesn&rsquo;t allow for those protections, then it needs to be changed. <br/>
