1. We are currently seeing AI&rsquo;s effects on creators, copyright owners, and the public through the SAG-AFTRA strikes. I&rsquo;ll spare you my tirade on the intent behind the rising push for AI generation, since it wouldn&rsquo;t be entirely relevant to the topic at hand and the workers reading this have enough to do, with 16000+ comments having been submitted at the time of writing.<br/><br/>www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/52030/1/people-cant-distinguish-between-ai-artificial-intelligence-human-art-new-study<br/><br/>www.techspot.com/news/99658-study-shows-how-often-people-can-identify-ai.html<br/><br/>www.businessinsider.com/openai-cant-identify-ai-generated-text-bad-for-internet-models-2023-7<br/><br/>People are horrifically bad at telling AI-generated content and human generated content apart, and the success rate for common people is falling. Furthermore, many publicly accessible &lsquo;is this AI&rsquo; tools fail to properly identify AI-generated content, especially in the case of text; a favorite test of mine is copy-pasting snippets of the Bible (which cannot be AI-generated due to its age) into these systems. In many cases, I get false positives.<br/><br/>This poses a grim threat to the reliability of information in our society in all forms, whether it be misinformation and disinformation on social media, the degradation of reliability of evidence in court, or similar circumstances, let alone how it shifts the economics of art in general.<br/><br/>Additionally, I believe it is a grave economic risk. AI providers, by providing art, voice acting, writing, and so on at impossibly cheap rates, even in middling to bad quality, risk monopolizing creativity, significantly damaging the diversity of expression available to consumers and limiting the ability to protest unethical behaviors. This has been seen time and time again as businesses grow and stamp out their competitors, and in this case, the competitors are a disorganized diaspora of creators that are bound by human needs, like needing to sleep and needing time to draw/speak/write.<br/><br/>AI generation threatens to crush this diaspora, making protest impossible (an artist is a shitty person, so they lose their customers, or a business does terrible things so people swap to consuming media from competitors; can&rsquo;t do that if the &lsquo;artist&rsquo; is one of a handful of multibillion dollar corporate monoliths providing AI generation services) and completely destroying a market for basic human communication and expression through overcommodification/monopolization.<br/><br/>I do not see any notable benefits that outweigh these risks. Yes, production becomes faster and cheaper, but the cheapness will never be passed down to the consumer and the speed will simply drown out human effort. It&rsquo;s already hard enough to get commissions as is, without a machine being able to do what you do, but hundreds of times faster without any moral, ethical, etc. qualms about the task. <br/><br/>The risks and harm are notable enough that tools are being developed as countermeasures for automatic training of AI models, such as Glaze, a tool made by University of Chicago students. These tools help protect against style mimicry, allowing artists to stave off the onslaught of AI threatening to outcompete them in their own style for a little longer by altering their publicly distributed images in ways that an AI model misinterprets, but human eyes don&rsquo;t.<br/><br/>2. As someone seeking to go into game design and development, yes. Games of many forms require massive up front investment for a deferred return that is far from guaranteed. A large part of this is asset generation. This does bring the barrier to entry down for hobbyist and independent (indie) developers, but also threatens to further saturate an over saturated market. Thankfully, Steam (the most major video game distributor for PC platforms) has outright banned all AI content over copyright concerns, which delays the harm for a while.<br/><br/>As a student, it&rsquo;s also devastating to the value of the assignments I complete and to my qualifications as a whole; if a student can cheat using AI so readily, further saturation and devaluation of qualifications can be expected.<br/><br/>4. The United States regulations should at least in part mirror the EU&rsquo;s stance, (especially regarding disclosure of the copyright status of generative AI data sets) and as far as international consistency is concerned, the restrictiveness of legislation (but not necessarily its implementation) should be as consistent as possible. Additionally, generative AI content should not be copyrightable unless all of the training data is licensed to both the AI&rsquo;s trainer and the end user of the AI.<br/><br/>5. Yes. We need new regulations desperately. We cannot expand the realm of copyright to include things like style, for that would be equally destructive as what we stop with it. However, voice, style, and textual impersonation through tuning these models to match the products of existing people does need to be banned.
