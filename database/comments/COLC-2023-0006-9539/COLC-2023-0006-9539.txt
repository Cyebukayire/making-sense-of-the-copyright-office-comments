AI generative technology is a direct threat to humanity&#39;s culture; not to mention the entire field of art. An artist&#39;s right to their work is their strongest asset. It is their proof of skill and visions. But artists cannot keep their work hidden behind visual paywalls. They must show their work to the public via social media or their online portfolios as a way to attract new clients and show the world their vision. This makes them vulnerable to data scrapping. As we know ALL of the best AI art generators have been trained using copyrighted human work, scrapped from online. This allows anyone who&#39;s never picked up a pencil, never thought once about the labor that goes into creating art, to create a half-baked but good enough imitations of their favorite artist online - while paying the developers of the AI but not the artists who&#39;s work made the AI&#39;s ability in the first place. Allowing AI generative art to be granted copyright is completely unethical and will no doubt hurt hundred of thousands of artists - the artists who have delivered our favorite stories and America&#39;s most popular characters that are beloved worldwide.<br/><br/>That&#39;s not to say AI does not have its place. It does, it can be a powerful tool to aid artist but this is not using AI as a tool. This is stealing. Developers are stealing work and money from the hardworking artists who made their inventions possible. <br/><br/>Should AI generative work be able to receive copyright, this will kill the dreams so many creators are barely clinging onto during this time. It is not worth it. Keep human work in human hands.
