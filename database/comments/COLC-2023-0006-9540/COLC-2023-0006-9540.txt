I am an arts major at my university, with a focus on illustration. It is my goal to obtain a job after graduation working on merchandise designs. The unregulated, rampant use of AI would hinder my ability to acquire meaningful work after I graduate. <br/><br/>AI does not generate new ideas from scratch. These AI banks are trained by companies illegally feeding them mass work from artists who are not credited nor compensated for their work. This &quot;mental bank&quot; of infringing material is then blended together and spat out by the AI algorithm, similar to how a blender produces juice from whole fruit. Due to resorting to databases of material that is already copyright infringing to begin with, it is my opinion as a creative and a future professional that these AI produced images and text are not and should not be copyrightable under the law.
