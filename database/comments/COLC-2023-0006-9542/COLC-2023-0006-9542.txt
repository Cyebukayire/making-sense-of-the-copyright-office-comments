I am a scientist working on HIV research, and I am deeply troubled by the seemingly unregulated usage of AI to circumvent Intellectual Property restrictions. For decades, government agencies in India and China have ignored international law and stolen patented American scientific IP. This has had a serious and negative effect on American industry, research, and technology, but it is nothing compared to the threat of AI. If AI tools are not heavily regulated and soon, public databases which exist enable researchers to collaborate and innovate will become prime targets for text-generative AI. If any person, foreign or domestic, can pirate scientific data and have an AI interpret and publish it for them, how long until researchers cease contributing to public databases all together? This would mean the end of open-source research, which has historically been the foundation of American scientific innovation and academic freedom.<br/><br/>AI must be prevented from accessing and analyzing data under intellectual property restrictions, and any AI software must make its source code and training data publicly available. I have no issue with generative AI that uses public domain materials as its training data. Yet AI companies are illegally pirating materials already under protection, slightly modifying them and claiming that this is fair use. This is an existential threat to the United States&#39; economy, society, and culture of intellectual freedom. AI companies must be prosecutable for their gross violations of IP law, and regulators must intercede to restrict further rampant abuses of these technologies.
