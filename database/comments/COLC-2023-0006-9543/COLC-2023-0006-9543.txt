AI art scrapes and recycles pre-established artwork without the consent or reimbursement of the artists whom it integrates. As an artist myself, I&rsquo;ve lost opportunities for multiple paid commissions in visual development when clients chose to utilize AI art programs to fulfill their needs. Thank you for considering our input.
