Thank you for opening the window for public comment on this issue. I am a strong supporter of authors and artists of all kinds, and I am even stronger in my belief that it is vital that their works are protected. Let me first assert that while I believe generative AI may have its uses, the current models have been built on a unethically sourced material. As long as these models are being built on a foundation of copyrighted works without permission, they are hollow and immoral. As artists and authors have exclusive rights to their material for a set time, it is a violation of copyright to use it without consent and/or compensation to train AI modules. These models cannot create; they can only copy. While they are technologically impressive, they only regurgitate the content that they are fed. Model-generated content cannot be considered art, and should not be able to be copyrighted (or otherwise treated) as such without significant human modification. I firmly believe that the current models must be destroyed and rebuilt on material that has been sourced ethically, with works in the public domain and with works by authors who have given permission, perhaps with compensation. This is crucial to the protection of authors and creators of all kinds. It is my wish that the Copyright Office takes positions to consider AI models built with copyrighted material, and works made by these models, to be a violation of copyright. Thank you for your time and consideration.
