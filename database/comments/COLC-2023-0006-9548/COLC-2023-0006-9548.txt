AI-created works should absolutely NOT be copyrighted or copyrightable. These machine learning systems are created using scraped (stolen) data from authors and artists and everyday people. No one should be able to copyright something they stole.<br/><br/>I&#39;m a writer. I&#39;ve heard countless stories of people losing out on work (or being underpaid) because someone can just &quot;do a draft in ChatGPT&quot;, as if that&#39;s in any way ok. It&#39;s not. My livelihood and the way I support my entire family is at risk if these people manage to copyright stolen AI-generated stuff.
