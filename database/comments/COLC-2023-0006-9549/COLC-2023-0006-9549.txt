In my opinion &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; auto generation systems impede on the copyright of an individual with how it will copy and build on preexisting artworks, voice models, text documents, etc.. This poses a threat to the free market on which this country is based upon and should have some form of regulation over it to ensure it is not misused. As with how most laws are there to regulate those who wish to do harm and have malicious intent, there appears to be a need for an overseeing of this new technology, not for the moral but because of those who use this tool to, as I can best describe it, cheat the system and bypass the hard work required to hone ones skills to be able to create. There also poses the threat of using these &quot;AI&quot; systems to obtain illegal information via careful word usage to break the systems out of the guidelines that the programmer may have set for the system. There have been various accounts of people using this process to gain the steps to make illicit drugs, obtain classified information, gain the private information of other users, the list goes on. I am supportive for the implementation of regulations on these systems to ensure the safety of this country and also our communities.
