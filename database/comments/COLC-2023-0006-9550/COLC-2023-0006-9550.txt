When I do a web search I will be directed to images and written material answering my query. If I choose to &quot;right click&quot; and take the image and use it, I am knowingly violating someone&#39;s IP and I&#39;m subject to the inherent risks associated with doing so. Most people, I believe, do not attempt to contact the copyright owner and seek permission to use the image or material - and they do so at their own risk. most of the time their use is personal so &quot;no harm no foul.&quot; However, if I were to use someone&#39;s images or written material and do so in something where I claim copyright, I am doing so knowingly and belligerently. In the case of using AI-generated content - which may full well contain copyrighted material, it should be incumbent on me (the user) to research what, if any, material AI provided, is protected. So, while the generating of content via AI may take only seconds, it may take hours for me to research whether or not what I have (been given) is copyrighted. In summary, I am suggesting that it is the sole responsibility of the (human) user to ensure that any attempts to copyright AI-generated (however much AI contributed) content does not contain any copyrighted material. This is an inevitable consequence of AIs being &quot;trained&quot; with materials that were protected by copyright.
