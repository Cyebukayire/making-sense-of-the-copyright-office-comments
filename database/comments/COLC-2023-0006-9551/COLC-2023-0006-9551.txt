Works created by AI, and not a human, should not be eligible for copyright. <br/>Even if the prompt was entered by a human, and then created by an AI (for example if I asked it to draw me a picture of a cow that was a grateful dead fan), the AI did the work not the person and thus it should not be eligible for copyright. <br/><br/>However if the person created the work on their own, without any AI, than it should be eligible. <br/><br/>AI created works create a problem for artists of all mediums and should not be eligible for copyright. <br/><br/>
