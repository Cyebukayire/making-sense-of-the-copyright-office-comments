As a citizen who has a lot of their presence based in online communities, I have seen a variety of arguments on the adoption of AI Generated media. It is of my opinion, though, that AI Generated media should not be granted copyright as a majority of the time, the media generated is based off of previously existing works that were not given approval to be used to studied by Generative AI. The largest example that comes to my mind is in the field of AI Image Generation, specifically AI art. There has been a large influx of AI Art within my spheres of interests and friends, and a majority of the feedback has been negative so far. As mentioned previously, a significant portion of AI Generated images have not gone through the proper methods of training these programs, often using art done by several human authors without their given permission. This alone is enough for me to be against giving AI Generated media its own copyright status, as the act of generating media is more akin to commissioning an artist, and when an artist is comissioned, the copyright stays with the artist, not with the client, unless explicitly said in advanced. Generative AI uses improperly sourced samples to create what appears to be original, but it is anything but original.
