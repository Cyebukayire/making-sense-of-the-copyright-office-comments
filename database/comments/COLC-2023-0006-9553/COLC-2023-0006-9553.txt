AI is okay for personal use but using it for anything commercial is simply stealing from artist who would otherwise benefit from it. People are using AI as a way to save money on artists because AI is usually either free or much cheaper than an actual artist who charges accordingly. It is unfair to the artists. On the other hand it is perfectly fine to use at home for personal use. In that case, there is no profit to be made, people aren&#39;t trying to replace artists, they are just having fun. In my opinion, AI isn&#39;t inherently bad, it should however be illegal to use commercially. Especially now, with the strikes across the country. Artists are tired of being treated like robots and being replaced by them.
