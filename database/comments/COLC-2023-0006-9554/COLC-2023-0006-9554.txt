Hello, I am writing this based on my stance on AI art and copyright. I believe that strengthening copyright is the worst way to go about this. We&#39;ve seen how copyright has ruined the music industry, we do not need this to happen to illustration. While I understand that artists are frustrated, we need to think of better solutions. This will absolutely harm small artists.
