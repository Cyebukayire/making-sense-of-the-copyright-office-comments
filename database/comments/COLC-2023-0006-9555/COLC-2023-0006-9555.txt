As an artist and content creator, I strongly oppose the use of my copyrighted images and online content as so-called &quot;training data&quot; for generative AI. As the copyright holder for my work, I view the unauthorized use of the artwork (prints, photos and poetry) as an infringement on my copyright and no different than someone photocopying my work and using it without permission or license. I do not consider this unauthorized use to be in any way simply &quot;fair use&quot;.
