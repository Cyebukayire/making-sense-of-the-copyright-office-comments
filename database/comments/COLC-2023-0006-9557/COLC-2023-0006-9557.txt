AI art should be subject to the exact same coppyright laws as human art, with the punishment for violoating them falling on the human who distributed the violating image.  The fact is that there is nothing ethicaly differnt between an AI taking inspiration from previosly existing human art, and a human doing so. We have already worked out how much inspiration a human is alowed to take before tey cant call it origional, just aply that to the AI. Not that I think our curent coppyright system is perfect, but thats a separate issue.
