AI brings no real value to us, it is flawed and unreliable. It is inaccurate and only replacing the reliance on people. This creates less jobs and incapacitates all expression of creativity. AI is eradicating all forms of art, whether it be writing or drawing, pictures or words and sounds that could be beautiful because of the effort and emotion behind it are being undermined by a machine that has none of those things that quite literally defines art. Why would I rely on this for information? If it is as sentient as some argue, that gives me even less assurance.
