Hello,<br/>I am a concerned citizen who doesn&rsquo;t want to live in a world where human creativity becomes fodder for AI learning. Works created by artificial intelligence will never be able to be copyrighted because of the way that AI learns. The internet has already made it incredible difficult for artists to maintain control over their IP, but allowing AI works or AI &ldquo;prompts&rdquo; to be copyrighted would be the end. Artwork, media, and other creative works are the thing that keep us most connected to our shared humanity. I don&rsquo;t want to know what it would look like to live in a society where we stop valuing that. The technology is developing faster than laws can keep up and it&rsquo;s a scary time.
