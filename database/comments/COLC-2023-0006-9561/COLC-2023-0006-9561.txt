Creative copyright and licensing are the foundation of the entertainment and creative industries. AI essentially uses copyright materials to &#39;teach&#39; the AI to then output creative work. The materials they used are not a licensed library. I worked at major entertainment companies and if we wanted to use a music, sound effects, stock library, font, art, etc for any purpose, we needed to have a licensing agreement to use it or purchase it outright in perpetuity. These AI companies are basically &#39;disrupting&#39; the entire creative industry similar to how they &#39;disrupted&#39; every other industry - by skirting regulation, contract, and labor laws. Tech makes things &#39;efficient&#39; by turning salaried or decent paying jobs into gig work or by trying to entirely cut out professions. And then once they bled the competition dry, they then start charging it all for themselves...which would have been spread out across the entire middle class before. <br/><br/>If an AI is &#39;training&#39; it&#39;s algorithm, it must have a paid legal contract agreement with the copyright holder of said work it is training from.
