Like all technologies, AI needs regulation to ensure that it is used in a responsible manner. The use extant works covered under copyright protections to train AI, without compensating the holder of the copyright, should not occur. Otherwise, we are allowing an entity (company) to profit from someone else&#39;s intellectual property. The fact that this is happening en masse does not negate the law. <br/>Furthermore, no AI generated content should be copyrighted. AI is a computer generating content from a database of the works of others. It is not creating content.
