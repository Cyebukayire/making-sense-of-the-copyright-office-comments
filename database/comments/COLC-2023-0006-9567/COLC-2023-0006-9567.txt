AI can do a lot of good for mankind but I believe in the long run AI takes away from the creative process of many people. When we start trusting AI to make choice, biases, and opinions in any scenario, we are giving up our human right to choice. While it may be easy to say AI can write this script, or edit that book, what we really are saying is our humanity cannot do what it has done since the beginning. What AI does, is start to influence us through its opinions of what the AI thinks we like. I hate that there are even algorithms in place online to appeal to me through ads, but that isn&rsquo;t why I&rsquo;m writing this today. Big companies who want to cut corners and use AI to write things or edit things will ruin what us as humans have been cultivating since the beginning. When an artist makes something, it can be truly appreciated by others. When I see something that AI has created, I can be impressed and blown away but there is a feeling in the pit of my stomach that what I&rsquo;m looking at is fake. I have no real appreciation for it and therefore it&rsquo;s a waste of my time and emotion. I have no intention of ever seeing a movie, reading a book, or enjoying artwork done by AI. All the efforts put into creating the AI by companies to cut corners and be cheap will be a waste and all that will be left in the end is a bunch of artificially created content that has no soul. I want to appreciate someone&rsquo;s work, not something&rsquo;s work. Using AI for anything in the entertainment field is spitting on humanity and its creative process. That is why I believe AI should not be used for anything in the entertainment field and if it is used in any other, that it needs to be monitored and regulated with extreme prejudice.
