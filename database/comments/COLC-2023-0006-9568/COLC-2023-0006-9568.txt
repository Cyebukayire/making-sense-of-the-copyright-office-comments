I&#39;m an independent author and my business segment has already seen a proliferation of use, and likely abuse, of AI. From partially to fully AI generated books, to covers designed entirely via AI, to audiobook narration done via AI.  This proliferation, in my opinion, is not a net positive. It is well known that the datasets of the major AI builds include scraped copyrighted data that the organization in question neither obtained permission to use nor adequately compensated the owners for. Others are now using that stolen data to bypass processes that used to otherwise require more time and/or paying someone else to do. It thus serves to threaten the livelihood of those who provide support services to authors - such as cover designers, narrators, and editors - while also threatening the livelihoods of other authors themselves. In my opinion, AI generated works should not be eligible for copyright protection. For starters, the effort to generate AI derived works is minimal compared to the actual effort a human might put in.  Secondly, thanks to the state of the current datasets, the AI generated output is likely built off of other copyrighted works that were illegally obtained, thus negating them from having protections themselves.
