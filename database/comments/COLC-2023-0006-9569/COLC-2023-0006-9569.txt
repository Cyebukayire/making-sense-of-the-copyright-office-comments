I believe that when used as a tool, LLMs and other AI models are no different than autocomplete on your mobile phone, or Photoshop&#39;s previous generation filters or its magic wand feature.<br/><br/>The quality of works produced 100% by AI, with zero human input, will not be competitive, and market forces will push it to the bottom. <br/><br/>Today, many open source builders and innovators find novel ways to work with AI and LLMs to produce amazing works, where the LLM is one component of many. As &#39;prompt engineering&#39; becomes less important over time, and the tooling matures, I think this will become more obvious.<br/><br/>Copyright is supposed to protect the small business, the single inventor, the one-person shop, the family business. It&#39;s been largely abused and used by giant organizations to stifle any new innovation.<br/><br/>We need a fundamental change to how copyright works in this country, as the current law could not have accounted for AI (nor can it account for where AI will go). We need guidelines rather than firm policies, as this technology is likely to change in ways we cannot predict.
