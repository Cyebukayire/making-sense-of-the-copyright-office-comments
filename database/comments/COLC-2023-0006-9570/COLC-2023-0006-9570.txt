Large Language Models (LLM), because to call the programs as they stand Intelligence is an insult to every degree of sentience, currently are fed all manner of created material, from paintings and stories to photography and instruction manuals without any form of retrieved consent from the creators of such material. This is a copyright violation based solely on the concept of fair-use. LLM&#39;s are not educated, critiquing, or capable of satire. They are large data processing programs. The processing of created material without permission from the owners is illegal. The things produced by LLM&#39;s are merely reorganizations of  created works, blatant theft of intellectual material. They are acts of plagarism. The users of these LLM&#39;s and the creators claim that these end results are unique and fully original, however the structures, characters, even sentences used have all been taken from copyrighted material without compensation and passed off as something new.
