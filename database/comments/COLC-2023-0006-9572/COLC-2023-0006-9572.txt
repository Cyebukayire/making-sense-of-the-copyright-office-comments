I&#39;m a journalist and a novelist, and I have two main concerns about AI.<br/><br/>The first is training data. I understand that AI is not cut-and-paste plagiarism, not a collage, and is a transformative work. So, in theory, it should not require permission for gathering its training data. However, when the results are used to directly compete with the creators of that training data, I believe that the AI companies need to get permission, or reimburse creators, or both. So, for example, if John Smith is a current artist, and an AI is trained on John Smith&#39;s work, and the AI companies allows its customers to generate images &quot;in the style of John Smith&quot; and charges for those images, then the AI company needs to get John Smith&#39;s permission and reimburse him for the generated images since they are in fact direct competition for his own output. For example, John Smith might want to create his own AI, trained on his own body of work, and sell those images himself. The AI company would cut into his income.<br/><br/>My second concern is that of copyright of finished work. I&#39;m personally on both sides of this issue, since I&#39;m a writer and journalist and would hate to be competing with a bunch of works created by companies who would then be able to copyright their output and no longer need to hire me to write it. However, I believe that AI images do deserve copyright protection, for the following reasons:<br/>1. Yes, AI images can be generated &quot;with the press of a button.&quot; But so can photographs. And photographs can be copyrighted.<br/>2. Yes, AI images can require little or no work on the part of the person entering a simple prompt. But this is also true of photographs.<br/>3. AI text -- or images -- are not always an &quot;all or nothing&quot; proposition. In fact, they soon will never be. AI is already used to correct grammar, for example, or to rewrite paragraphs to sound clearer. Photoshop has built-in generative AI to allow artists to modify small parts of an image, the background of an image, or the entire image. AI images can be generated based on pencil sketches that a human drew. AI text can be generated based on outlines that a human wrote. Then, after the images are generated, artists and writers -- the writers and artists who would want to claim copyright, especially -- will modify those images and those texts to better fit their vision and style.<br/>4. A photographer can copyright photographs that were taken on a timer -- they didn&#39;t even have to press a button. What matters is the intent. I believe the same should be true for AI text and images.<br/>5. Yes, two people using the same prompt (and the same seed) will create the same result. But two photographers standing in the same location with the same cameras at the same time with the same settings can take identical photos -- or identical enough not to be distinguishable by human eye. But they can both copyright their images.
