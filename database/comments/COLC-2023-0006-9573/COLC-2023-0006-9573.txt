Hi. I think AI is complete and utter trash. The fact that we as a society in the US have stooped so low to try and create art, something that is extremely human, via machine algorithms, shows to the rest of the world how little we care about anything and are always eager to replace. This also shows to that people would rather steal ideas (no surprise) from individuals who have worked their skill for many years instead of learning. And there are also individuals who steal because they have no time to learn any of the skills that are being stolen from AI technology because there is no time for free time in America. Maybe instead of funding AI, we could, oh I don&#39;t know, put that funding back into schooling to support the arts for students again or perhaps making workshops for adolescents and adults to attend to hone a skill in the arts.
