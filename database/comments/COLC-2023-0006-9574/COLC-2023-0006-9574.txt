I do believe that AI imagery, as with many things created with generative AI, should not be considered for copyright protection. The minimal amount of human effort involved takes very little skill to master and the output is generated from a plethora of different mediums, including copywritten material and massive amounts of personal media. A study by Somepalli et al (Diffusion Art or Digital Forgery? Investigating Data Replication in Diffusion Models) has researched the effects of ai generation, that, even if fractional in chance, AI imagery can contain visibly copywritten material, especially at the rate in which it is outputting images. AI should not infringe so effortlessly on the artistic sphere when it blatantly survives off of the very artists it is trying to compete against.
