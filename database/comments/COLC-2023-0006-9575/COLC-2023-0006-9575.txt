I am a firm believer that works made with Artificial Intelligence should NOT be able to be copyrighted. Copyright exists for human intellectual property. Since AI is not human and has no brain, its ideas can never be original. All AI can do is study and regurgitate the work of others -- often without their permission, which presents a whole other issue. When AI &quot;creates&quot; something, it can have no authorial intent, deeper meaning, or nuance. Work made from AI has no soul and cannot present anything new, not even a new twist on an old idea, which is the whole point of copyright. How can something be original and worthy of protection when it is just stolen pieces of other work? Those who want to copyright AI works are only seeking to do so in order to remove the need for artists, writers, etc., in order to cut costs, but what they are left with is work that cannot bring anything authentic to culture or create any kind of change because it is made by a machine. This poses the greatest danger to art, as work made to be so effectively &quot;harmless&quot; not only robs artists of their hard work as AI feeds off of it, but also robs the world of the medium that has been the driving force to move it forward throughout history.
