as an artist, ai as it currently is, in my opinion, is inherently copyright infringement and a violation of labor rights. if my art or writing or likeness or questions to a chatbot are part of an algorithm used to generate ai work, and i was not asked for permission for my work to be used in that way, that is a violation of my rights. the only ethical or legal way to have ai should be opt-in. programs and algorithms are not people, they do not have rights, they are a tool to make people money and should be strictly regulated as such or they risk hurting people.
