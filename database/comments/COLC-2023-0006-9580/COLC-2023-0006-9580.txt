It is impossible to copyright anything produced by AI. These generative AI programs are essentially a plagiarism machine, pulling patterns out of copyrightable work and regurgitating them. <br/><br/>Anything &mdash; an image, a song, a video, etc &mdash; composited by a program is not copyrightable. Something with no intellect cannot have intellectual property. A human putting in prompts to generate a &ldquo;work&rdquo; is not sufficient intelligent involvement to constitute authorship of that &ldquo;work.&rdquo; That would be like saying that the guy who puts a quarter into a jukebox holds copyright over the song he chooses to play.<br/><br/>On top of that, though perhaps less poignant, is the fact that there is no way to measure &ldquo;how transformed&rdquo; a work is when it&rsquo;s used to train an AI program and then is regurgitated, as these programs are trained on scraped and stolen content rather solely on images, etc that are in the public domain. <br/><br/>For example, if a movie studio were to use AI to generate assets such as character design, there would be no way to establish a chain of inspiration to ensure that the design is wholly original and does not closely resemble an existing work to the point of being grounds for a suit. <br/><br/>You would not be able to hold the program responsible for any potential copyright infringement resulting from its use, therefore it cannot be treated as a legitimate copyright holder in its own right.
