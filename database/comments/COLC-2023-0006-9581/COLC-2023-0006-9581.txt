I am a hobby visual artist with several professional artist friends. AI art is not art it is theft  of intellectual property. These programs are trained by feeding them the hard work of individuals who have spent years honing their skills always without their knowledge, consent, and with bo clear way to opt out of it. An AI art thief could &quot;create&quot; a piece of art trained using the art of a real artist who did not give permission or consent and if they sell it or generate any funds from it its no different than someone printing out art made by someone else and selling it for a profit with no intention to give part of those funds to the actual creator.
