I believe AI should not be allowed to train using copyrighted works, or must obtain all the proper licenses and pay proper fees to use copyrighted works. It is unfair to artists and writers whose art and writing styles can be copied and reproduced by AI without offering credit or compensation. Additionally, because AI is trained on outside sources, anything produced by AI should not be eligible for copyright. Allowing AI produced content to be copyrighted disincentivises companies from hiring and paying artists and writers, and would have significant economic impacts.
