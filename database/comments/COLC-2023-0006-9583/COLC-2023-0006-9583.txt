I don&#39;t think anything that has been written by AI should be able to be copywritten, even if it is touched up by a human as AI is just plagiarizing other work that is already out there. This will lead to a downward spiral of art as art is an expression of human emotions and experiences, you can&#39;t have a computer recreate that and have it copywritten as an original piece.
