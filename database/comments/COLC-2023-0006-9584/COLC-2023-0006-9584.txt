AI generated content absolutely should not be eligible for copyright, and we desperately need further documentation and regulation into what types of content can be generated, and where these algorithms get their content from.<br/>We are dealing with mass theft, mass plagiarism, mass misinformation, and it needs to be quelled. I myself am an artist, and I do not consent to having algorithms copy my work. There are famous artists who have not consented to having their names, their styles, their very livelihoods, stolen and re-packaged as keywords. It is downright theft, and it is abhorrent.<br/>Artists desperately need to be protected from this.<br/>Artists are hard-working, dedicated creators, who spend their entire lives perfecting their craft.<br/>And all of that is being exploited by an uncaring technology, wielded by lazy profiteers.<br/><br/>We NEED regulation, ASAP.
