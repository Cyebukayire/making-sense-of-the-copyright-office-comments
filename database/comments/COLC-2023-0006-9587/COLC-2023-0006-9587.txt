My primary concern involving artificial intelligence and copyright relates to the livelihood of artists, writers, composers, and other individuals who rely on the act of creation to survive.<br/><br/>If an AI is trained on artwork that I have made without my consent, that AI may then be able to create work that mimcs my own unique style. This could then jeopardize my livelihood, because the AI can create work at a greater volume than I can.<br/><br/>I am of the belief that having independent artists, writers, composers, and so on, is  net benefit to our culture. As such, I would like any legislation to take these people&#39;s needs into consideration.
