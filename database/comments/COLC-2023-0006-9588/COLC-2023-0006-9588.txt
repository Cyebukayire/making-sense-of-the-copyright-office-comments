As an individual creator who makes money selling art on the side, it is imperative to me that AI-generated content CANNOT be copyrighted. All an AI-artsit is capable of is sifting through other people&#39;s rightful intellectual property and recombining it according to an algorithm &ndash; in other words, theft. Whereas human-created content can draw inspiration from other artists, AI is capable of no such thing, only theft of other people&#39;s art.
