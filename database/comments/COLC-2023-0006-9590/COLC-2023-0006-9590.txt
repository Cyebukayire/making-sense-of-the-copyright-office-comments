AI-generated content is not generated by AI, it exists by taking existing data whether it is textual, visual, or aural and taking various elements of existing data and putting it through an algorithmic process to take a best guess at what a given user prompt is asking for. The existing data is the creative works of numerous authors, painters, songwriters, singers, and other artist scraped and broken down without compensation or license in order to build this technology. As an aspiring writer, i am terrified how this technology could steal my own creative work and repurpose it withou consultation or comment. It is imperative that the copyright office step in, force the companies to disclose every creative work sampled and used for the construction of their models, and force compensation to each artist who have had their work appropriated by them.
