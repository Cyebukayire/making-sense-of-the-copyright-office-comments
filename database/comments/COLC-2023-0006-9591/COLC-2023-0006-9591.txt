Name: Joseph Ucuzoglu<br/><br/>I think that an AI &quot;bot&quot; should legally be treated and held to the same standard as a human employee agent. AI bots should not be scrutinized more or less due to their lack of &quot;human-ness&quot;.<br/><br/>A creator of a bot (i.e. Anthropic, OpenAI etc...) is an employer training an employee that they then contract to other users. If they steal materials that they did not pay for in a manner that would be illegal if training a human employee then they should be held to those legal standards. If they are training on materials that are legally available to other humans (for free or legally paid for) then that training for bots should be fair game. If an employer trains employees on materials that the employer attained illegally that employer (not the employee) will be penalized and the damaged party made whole, but there is no expectation that those learned and stored ideas in the mind of the employee must somehow be erased. It is generally accepted that once someone learns something they retain that even if they did so through illegal means. Yet that person is still always held to the standard that they may not infringe on the rights of the legal owner of that content. Knowing the content is not infringing. Fair use of elements of the content where it is legal is not infringing regardless of how that content was gained.<br/><br/>With respect to humans who contract with the bot creator for the employees &quot;AI Bot&quot; time the product produced by the bot should be held to the same standards as it would be if the creator were a human.<br/><br/>An author who uses an AI bot is using an &quot;writing assistant&quot;. If that writing assistant uses the same prose for several jobs (real people have done this) then the use of that prose if it had already been registered would not be lawful. However, where a person can contract another entity (person or machine) and then have that entity sign over the use of that material to the registrant it should hold the same level of utility regardless of if that entity is human or machine.<br/><br/>A writer using a machine to write curates that content in the same way that a writer with means might hire a human to write content that they later curate and submit to the copyright office.<br/><br/>I think there is plenty of precedent to make these determinations of fair use if AI Bots are classified in the same manner as a 3rd party human contributor would be classified. This might be less a question about Artificial Intelligence with respect to Copyright and more a question of the legal standing of AI Bot contracted content to 3rd party registrars and how that impacts submissions.
