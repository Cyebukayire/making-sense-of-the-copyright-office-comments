I would request that the formal study into AI and whether it breaches copyright law be taken with the utmost seriousness. The websites responsible for the art projects have to specifically train their bots by feeding art into their databank to be copied from at a later date, generally without the creators knowledge. This trend has bled into companies like Wattpad and Twitter sneaking clauses into their extensive terms of service that enable the company to outright steal content created by people and then edit it with AI to then make a profit from it. There are many many creators who run their businesses online, and if the AI content stealing isn&#39;t dealt with, then many people will suffer.<br/><br/>It has already spread to some artists I know being turned down for having a relatively cheap commission price and being told the buyer could &quot;just scan some of your art and use the prompts anyways,&quot; as if the artist who created their artstyle and was still working a full time job, didn&#39;t deserve to be paid for their labor. This cannot be allowed to set a precedent.
