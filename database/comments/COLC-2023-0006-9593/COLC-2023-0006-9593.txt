I don&#39;t believe that any works generated by AI should have a copyright claim. It seems to me that the core of copyright is the human element, and to remove that element is to remove the validity of copyright. There is more legal grey area in AI generated materials that are then molded and shaped by human input, but the underlying work is still ineligible for copyright. It also seems that many AI generated materials are actually engaging in copyright infringement by drawing upon copywritten sources.
