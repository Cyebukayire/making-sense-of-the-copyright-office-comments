Under no circumstances should AI generations be protected by copyright. The most AI should be is a tool to assist in creation, and cannot be regarded as a creator in its own right as it is unable to create original content. Additionally, copyrighting AI content is an insult to the many creators whose works have been used to train the AI, almost always without consent. Many of these creators already have issues with not being credited for their own work, or with others claiming their work as their own. Adding AI to the struggles of smaller creatives is an injustice. Lastly, allowing AI to exploit copyright laws would mean many creatives would be robbed of their livelihood, as large companies would jump on the opportunity to not pay for their labor, which may lead to an economic crisis.
