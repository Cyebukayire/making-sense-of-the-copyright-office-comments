Thanks for opening this up for comment! I am an author and artist and have quite a few artists in my immediate circle, and we are all concerned about the way AI is being used in art. Current copyright policy grants creators the exclusive right to their work during the copyright period. This use policy should apply to AI as well--ilet it train on public domain materials, but not recent works. Allowing generative AI to train on copyrighted works without gaining the creator&#39;s consent violates their right to control how their work is used, and makes it harder for artists to receive fair compensation for their skills. <br/><br/>Generative AI that trains on copyrighted works without gaining the creator&#39;s permission should be found in infringement of copyright law.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time!
