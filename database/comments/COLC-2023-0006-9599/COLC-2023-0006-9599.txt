ai as far as generative art is concerned uses the artwork, writing, photographs and images to train their algorithms in order to create this work. because of this, someone using these programs can purposefully OR unknowingly be creating something derivative of another persons work which includes individual creators, but also companies in film, games, etc. because of this the art should not be able to be copywritten as it is using pieces that are already so, and most of the time, without consent from the original creators. in that sense, it could be argued that ai art and writing often is already violating copyright by merely doing what it does.
