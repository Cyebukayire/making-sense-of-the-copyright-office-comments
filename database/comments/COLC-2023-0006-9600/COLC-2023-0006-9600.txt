hello! i am a concerned youth and aspiring artist in many avenues of creativity and i strongly feel that AI works SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE COPYRIGHTED. this is because artificial intelligence creating art and other things that would, in the past, need creativity and human ingenuity can be solved like a math equation. this to me defeats the purpose of art and most important media that requires a human understanding to make.<br/>art is NOT MEANT TO BE JUST VISUAL REPRESENTATION. since the dawn of time the purpose of art has been to express yourself and the unique experience of being human. handing the brush off to a program may produce perfect results visually, but it lacks one crucial aspect of art. soul.
