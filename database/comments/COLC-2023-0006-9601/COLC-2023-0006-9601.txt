Thank you for seeking public input on this matter. I believe that AI generated pieces  should not be copyrighted, as it is borrowing works from multiple artists and writers. While this tool can be helpful in one&rsquo;s personal life, it is at best glorified plagiarism in a professional setting. AI art is made because of the general public, and it should belong to the general public.
