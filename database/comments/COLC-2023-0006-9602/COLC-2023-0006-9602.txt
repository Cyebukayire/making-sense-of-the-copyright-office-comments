Content generated purely by artificial Intelligence should NOT be eligible for copyright protection. These programs are not conscious, there is not &lsquo;intellect&rsquo; crafting an &lsquo;intellectual property&rsquo;. It does not think or consider anything, and merely skim data archives for input to recombine in the approximation of a given prompt. No one made it, there is no author or artist behind what it spits out. There is nothing to plagiarize and therefore nothing to copyright. Unless something generated by an AI has been altered substantially by a person to the point that it is recognizably distinct and separate, whatever has been generated should be ineligible for copyright.
