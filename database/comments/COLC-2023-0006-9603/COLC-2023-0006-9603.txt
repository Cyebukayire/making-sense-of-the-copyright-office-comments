I am a professional illustrator, and I do not think that art created by AI should be copyright protected. I have seen how generators are used and have a basic understanding of how they produce &quot;new images&quot;. The person imputting the prompts is, at most, doing the work of an art director. However, the key difference is that they are utilizing the work of people who they do not employ, credit, or compensate in any way. Often people will prompt generators to use a dataset comprised of the works of a famous artist, and they explicitly use the name of the artists in those prompts. Those cases are the most blatant example of exploitation. In our field, an art director or client must commission or employ us for these things. With generative AI, our art is used in datasets without our knowledge, consent, or even compensation. To my knowledge, even companies like Adobe who claim to have a compensation system do not actually provide the compensation and very rarely enforce their own removal policies unless the artist complaining has a broad social presence.<br/><br/>Generative AI isn&#39;t evil, but the way it is currently used is often exploitative of the art that it is built on. Many circles who are fond of AI actually revel in the idea of putting artists out of work by unfair means. There are people who get excited about literally using our own work to put us out of work.<br/><br/>I do not think Generative AI can be ethically copyrightable in this state.
