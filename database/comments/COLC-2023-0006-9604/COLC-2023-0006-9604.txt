Generative models are derived works of every element in the training set. Cooperative generative tools (smart infill etc) are derived works of every element in the training set and the work currently authored by the user of the tool. I believe these statements are intrinsically true and obvious. The model could not exist in the current state without the training set.<br/><br/>Copyright allows for the control of licensing of works. Derived works generated without a license for the original are subject to copyright by the holder of the original work.<br/><br/>I believe generative models are and should be subject to 1 count of copyright violation per unlicensed work in the training set per image generated. Licensure for training generative models should not be inferred except in cases where the work is wholly owned by the entity (as in prior work for hire assignment).<br/><br/>It is the responsibility of the licensee to know that the chain of licensing is correct. In the event a breach is detected by a service offering generated works, they should remove the unlicensed work from the training set and discard the original (unlicensed) model and notify any clients/customers of unlicensed works they created or helped create. This means license failures should be costly not only in the form of fines and regulatory action, but also in the need to fully retrain the model using only fully licensed components.<br/><br/>The US copyright office should not allow the whitewashing of copyright to the detriment of artists and creative people/organizations to line the pockets of technology companies whose interest is to compete with the people whose work they stole in order to enter the market. However, if the full chain of ownership and licensing is available, I don&#39;t see any issue with the technology or improved tools for artists.
