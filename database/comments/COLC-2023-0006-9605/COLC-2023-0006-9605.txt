I&#39;m not someone who makes my living off art or commissions. However, writing is still something I&#39;ve loved and engaged with my entire life. I have over a decade&#39;s worth of writing, both academic and creative, in Google Drive and published across different platforms. I am concerned that the increase in AI scraping across the internet will result in unintended plagiarism. The last thing any student needs is for them to submit their research paper, which they&#39;ve worked incredibly hard on, and lose points because it scans to an AI generated article using similar academic writing techniques. The last thing I would want as a student and historian is for me to find my words and research used in an AI-generated article. It would also be heartbreaking to see &quot;academic&quot; articles and research generated without the human element, which would fundamentally alter how we study history. And it would also irreparably damage career opportunities for prospective historians to have AI take over a huge portion of their specialty.<br/>And as a creative writer, even my unpublished writing feels very much like intellectual property. And again, I can&#39;t emphasize how heartbreaking it would be as a prospective author to try and get something reviewed or published and have people reject it because it&#39;s too similar to an AI-written story or narrative. AI that scraped my writing to begin with.<br/>Overall, I have no expertise to comment on most of the copyright issues presented by AI. But as someone who is creative and academic, I can speak to the desire of simply not having my writing and intellectual hard work and property stolen by machines. Especially if those machines have other humans behind them.
