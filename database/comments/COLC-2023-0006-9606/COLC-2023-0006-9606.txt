I have lost freelance fiction editing opportunities to AI software such as ChatGPT. I have seen the editing this software does and it is subpar for the industry when not actively false or plagiarized. This software seems to be degrading over time as it is exposed to more and more literature as well, which I find odd considering the assumption that more exposure would allow the algorithm to hone in on correct language. AI art is theft. It is drawn from existing artwork only. There is no such thing as an AI &quot;artist&quot; and those that use the programs for images should not be allowed to claim copyright on their images.<br/><br/>I am also concerned about AI&#39;s use in nonfiction. Books generated in this method, especially cooking and foraging books, pose significant threats to consumers&#39; wellbeing because the algorithm does not seem to be capable of fact checking itself. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trusting-field-guides-mushroom-hunting-225527626.html
