It actually should be called applied statistics with its obvious theft of information taken from artists, writers, actors, and anyone that has so much as typed, spoken, or appeared online. The current state of the online world is even more fractured from search engines&#39; top results being generated answers/images that are factually false, and there is even now a book about mushrooms that was &quot;written&quot; by &quot;ai&quot; that is completely inaccurate and could get someone killed.<br/><br/>I realize that this is purely a question of how Copyright laws should move forward with &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; and it should not have the status of being under copyright protected.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a much bigger issue that needs to be discussed with greater issues in our society that even allowed this to come about. The dismissal of the Arts in society is only to be seen as a means of &quot;content&quot; and nothing more.<br/><br/>There are already accounts of artists who were pressured by their superiors to feed their work into a generator, so their superior can claim the final result as their own work. It was not.<br/><br/>There needs to be greater protection for the disempowered because it will be used as a means to cut corners and steal the very soul of humanity itself.<br/><br/>As ridiculous as that sounds, people have already have had their livelihoods stolen as those on top chose to get &quot;free&quot; options instead of actually paying actual humans.<br/><br/>&quot;Oh, but they signed their rights away!&quot;<br/><br/>With the emergence of using one&#39;s biometrics to gain access from bank accounts to the very phone I&#39;m using to type this comment, its going too far to claim a person&#39;s information for life and then some.<br/><br/>A recent film used a dead man&#39;s likeness, and so, we have officially crossed the threshold of a reality where the existence of zombies is a fact.<br/><br/> They have brought the dead back to life in the most disgusting way possible that violates the rights of the dead. I do not care if their estate allows it because the dead have no one to speak for their best interest (worse so when it is a studio), and if it means going through this avenue to help in the case of living, so be it.<br/><br/>I apologize for my lack of concentration on how much of a breach this will become to every facet of human civilization, but this is a much bigger issue than the current political war encroaching on our right to privacy.<br/><br/>To the individual that is reading this, thank you and I truly wish you a great day.
