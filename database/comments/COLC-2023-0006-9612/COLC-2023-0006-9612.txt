<br/>Copyrighted works should not be allowed to be used to train AI models without the copyright owner&rsquo;s consent. Using copyrighted material to be regurgitated by AI constitutes an unfair use of the copyrighted material. <br/>As the law currently stands, the material generated using AI systems cannot be copyrighted. This should continue. A machine does not create, it regurgitates information that was fed into it. As such, there is no creation, no inherent act to create. This lack of creation should be met with a lack of copyright.<br/>AI systems owners should be held liable for infringing on works generated by their AI. AS it currently stands, AI systems regurgitate information. This information is based on what was fed into it. As we have learned, current LLM AI was fed a steady stream of copyrighted works. By regurgitating these works, they are infringing copyright. As such, the AI system owners should be held liable for infringement just as a person would be held liable for infringement. The AI system owners, not the AI itself, for it is not a human, should be held liable for the infringement. <br/>Generative AI that imitates the identity or style of human artists should not be able to be copyrighted. It is taking copyrighted material, often used without the artists&rsquo; permission, and regurgitating similar artwork in ways that do not constitute fair use. <br/>
