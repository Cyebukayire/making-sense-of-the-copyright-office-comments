I myself am not a visual artist, but I&#39;m friends with a lot of people who are, and I genuinely believe AI art to be one of the greatest threats to any potential livelihood they could be making to this day. Not only does it prevent people from being able to claim any kind of ownership to their designs, it also creates a great degree of consumer confusion as to which pieces are real and which are not, and could have a chilling effect on further creative fields (many of which are already deeply suffering economically)
