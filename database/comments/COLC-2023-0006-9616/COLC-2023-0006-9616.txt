AI systems pose a threat to the essence of human creativity. We cannot underestimate the danger they represent to creative professionals. There&#39;s an imminent risk of funneling economic power into the hands of a select few AI corporations, leaving countless creatives in the lurch. We must grasp the urgency of this situation.<br/><br/>AI&#39;s ability to generate text, images, and music hinges on the quality of its training material. Currently, AI developers exploit the creative works of individuals without consent, without recompense, and without regard for the consequences. Creative professionals are unjustly excluded from sharing in the economic gains derived from their own creations.<br/><br/>We must demand immediate action. The digital realm must safeguard the works and accomplishments of creative professionals. The mere technical capability to mine text and data should never legitimize unauthorized use.<br/><br/>Fair compensation is the lifeblood of creative work. AI companies are driven solely by economic interests. Their commercial utilization of creative works must be regulated, licensed, and appropriately compensated.<br/><br/>We demand transparent training data as a non-negotiable requirement for AI providers. Market approval for AI systems should hinge on their ability to unequivocally demonstrate author permissions. The responsibility for adhering to copyright law and using compliant sources lies squarely with the user, not the author. AI systems must exclusively train on transparent, copyright-compliant sources.
