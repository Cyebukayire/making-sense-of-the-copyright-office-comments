Generative AI allows increased access to the creative arts for individuals with disabilities, such as long covid and traumatic brain injuries. While there should be some guidelines put in place to prevent abuse, it should be allowed so that individuals are able to continue with their creative works. Generative AI as a tool is powerful at assisting in this work. Currently, it is not strong enough to replace the work of a creative human without substantial work. Additionally, it should be noted that there is a lot of human interaction and intention in creative prompting. One cannot simply type in &quot;draw a dragon&quot; or &quot;write a story about a dragon and a knight&quot; and get anything good. It takes effort to create a solid prompt to render anything useable, and even beyond that often editing is done. Generative art images are no different from stock images, while opening up more diversity (easier to find POC, different body shapes, etc - everyone is not a 20 year old supermodel.) Generative text is critical to allow writers assistance with outlines, brainstorming, fighting &quot;blank page syndrome&quot;, writer&#39;s block, and more. Please do not allow short-sighted people who yell loud roll back all of the benefits of this technology. It would be like rolling back smartphones. The assistance of these tools is unparalleled.
