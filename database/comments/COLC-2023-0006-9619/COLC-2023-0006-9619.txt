I have real concerns about the use of copyrighted or trademarked materials on AI learning algorithms. I am a creative, and my own intellectual property may have been used without my knowledge in AI training. I never gave my permission or consented to having my work used in this way.<br/><br/>It&#39;s my opinion that scraping or using any art protected by copyright or intellectual property law without the express permission of the creator should be illegal for AI. Just like it is for humans.
