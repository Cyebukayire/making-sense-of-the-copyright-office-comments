I am a musician and make my entire living from my art. While AI-generated content undoubtedly has its place in our collective future, the simple fact is that every instance of AI in mainstream use was &quot;trained&quot; using samples stolen from human creators. While the tech industry will claim that this is just &quot;inspiration&quot; akin to a human artist emulating another human artist, that&#39;s tantamount to saying M.C. Hammer was simply &quot;inspired&quot; by Rick James&#39; &quot;Superfreak&quot; when he actually stole a sample for his #1 hit.<br/><br/>The implications of copyrighting AI-generated are dire for those of us creating art from scratch. What happens, for example, when a song draft I&#39;ve uploaded to Soundcloud is used to &quot;train&quot; an AI model, then someone creates an AI-generated song that incorporates my music, then copyrights it before I&#39;m ready to release the original work? This is industrial espionage, not innovation.<br/><br/>Under no circumstances should AI-generated works be eligible for copyright without the assertion that the AI model was trained entirely from either royalty-free sources or the publisher&#39;s own intellectual property. Even then, those stipulations put an onerous burden on artists who typically lack the capital to sue these entities for plagiarism.<br/><br/>This nightmare needs to end before it begins.
