Protect humans, not AI! AI must be fed human work in order to develop art/words. There&#39;s no way around that. Copyright is there to protect humans--and to ensure progress. AI regurgitates past human work. It neither creates something new, nor does it progress humanity&#39;s understanding of art or knowledge. As an author who makes her living with words, I think it&#39;s vital to protect authors&#39; original works. My books are pirated often, and copyright ensures that I can at least take the pirated works down. AI pirates my work by blending it with other pirated work. Without the support of the government, AI will stifle creativity, limit humans from succeeding in the arts, and promote workarounds. Additionally, beyond the arts, AI information is NOT credible, as has been proven countless times, and a reliance upon AI will dimish scientific and other nonfiction resources. It actively spreads misinformation that seems real, such as articles with falsified citations. Artificial intelligence may be artificial, but it&#39;s certainly not intelligent.
