Artificial intelligence, or more accurately, machine learning is currently producing &quot;art&quot; following prompts. These &quot;works&quot; created by the machines are built off of stolen work because of their internet scraping models. &quot;Art&quot; stolen by these machines should not be able to receive protections, and, i believe that people using machine learning should not be allowed to make &quot;art&quot; unless given explicit permission from those the machine is learning from.
