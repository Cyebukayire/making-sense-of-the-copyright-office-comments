I am a screenwriting, aspiring to be a member of the Writers Guild of America (WGA). I have been practicing this craft for seven years, and other forms of writing, including poetry, songs, press releases, and academic papers, for over a dozen before that. All of this has helped me become the writer I am today. I could could soon be in direct competition with AI and my previous work could be used as training for AI software, if it hasn&#39;t already. I am very concerned with copyright law and policy regarding AI systems. I applaud the Copyright Office&#39;s 2021 affirmation that artworks &quot;all require human authorship as a condition of copyrightability.&quot; This is merely a first step, as new legal cases and precedents pending. The Office needs to put forth legislation that enshrines the ruling and will further prevent works written by humans using AI systems to obtain copyrights. Works generated by AI is no different than plagiarized work. Indeed, since AI is trained on works on the internet, it does not actually create anything, merely regurgitate previously published materials, albeit in a slightly different form and order. Works written by humans, on the other hand, are informed by experiences, emotions, inspirations, and come with an individualized voice. Humans create materials; AI merely copies and rearranges it, almost always without paying the original authors whose work was used in training. Using AI only devalues and undermines the work written by real humans who have trained for years, tapped into (often hard to face) emotions and traumas. I urge the office not to allow plagiarism to continue unabated. Thank you for your time.
