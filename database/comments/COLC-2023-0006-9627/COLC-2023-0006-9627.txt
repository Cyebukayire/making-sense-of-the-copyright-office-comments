Generative AI runs on a mass amount of copyrighted material theft, i would like for you to demand all current datasets be destroyed. and to never grand copyright protection to AI generated works of any kind.<br/>art is very personal, and to see it be automated like this, it just feels wrong. and it will destroy absolutely all creative industries. imagine a world without art. no more TV and movies, no more Music on the Radio to listen to at work. no amazing paintings to give life color. to make art is to be Human. this whole Democratization argument is a lie. Art is already the most accessible thing in the world, anyone could learn it if they have enough drive for it, people think they can&#39;t draw because no one teaches em how, and making art is discouraged in all fields of education, well outside art itself of course.<br/>art is fun, i get to create little worlds on a page. all generative AI programs do is hit a random button and produce slop, it does not think like a human. it is not a tool, a Ruler is an Art tool.<br/>if these programs continue to exist i fear our god granted souls will die and be replaced by emptiness. we&#39;d just become soulless husks.<br/><br/>below is a screenshot i made when i searched my Deviantart username. i saw a few of my old artworks inside the dataset that was used to train StableDiffusion, i was not contacted by either Deviantart or Stability AI if i was ok with my artworks being used to train these AI models. i only found out after the fact.
