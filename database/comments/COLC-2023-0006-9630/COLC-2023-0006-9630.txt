As an artist, the current state of AI is extremely concerning to me. All available AI is currently trained through data or content scrubbed from the internet, and while this data may be available for public viewing, numerous artists (myself included) have been effective by these programs using our intellectual property without our consent. What this means is that anything these AI programs produce are created using stolen content, which the public can, without necessarily realizing what they&#39;re doing, use or profit off that content. This is extremely damaging to the creative community at large, whether it is visual art, writing, music, or video, many of which may even be under copyright protection as it is.<br/><br/>These AI programs are not true AI, they do not create something new, they simply butcher and paste together existing work created by real people. People whose livelihoods could be impacted by mimics claiming to be original works, mimics that plagiarism programs can&#39;t identify, which could very realistically cost someone their job. Artists have a hard enough time with digital thieves impacting our jobs and reputations as it is, this country can&#39;t allow them to copyright those thieveries as well. This country needs to stand by its hard-working people, its artists, and its culture, not by mechanical mimics.<br/><br/>
