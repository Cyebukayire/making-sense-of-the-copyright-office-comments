I find artificial intelligence to be honestly, a farce, a complete and utter farce. There is no intelligence from these tools, emphasis on tools, because they only learn from images put into their memory and nothing else.<br/><br/>They use already it to plagiarizer artists&#39; work, then claim its their own. entirely these &quot;ai&quot; tools are a way to cut the legs out from under artist&#39;s for not underselling or selling out to companies who do not want to pay their fair share to artists<br/><br/>These &quot;tools&quot; are entirely used for anti-competition work, its the equivalent of tracing as well as ripping an image to just change a few things to it. <br/><br/>If these companies want art they should pay their fairshare to the artists, and stop trying to outsource everything from people who deserve a living!
