I am a beginer artist on the internet, as well as fans with many people where art is their lively hood.<br/><br/>An artist&#39;s style is almost like their fingerprint. While we can emulate another&#39;s style, and do our best to make our art like another&#39;s, it&#39;s almost impossible to be done by hand. An AI, however, can sample art indiscriminately. If properly trained, it could also be used to replicate art nearly-perfectly. To the point where only the artist themselves would actually know if they drew it. It could be used to make people say things, or endorce things they don&#39;t actually. It can be used to take money away from the people who depend on comission money. <br/><br/>AI, especially AI in the arts is incredibly dangerous, and ads next to nothing into the industry, outside of danger.
