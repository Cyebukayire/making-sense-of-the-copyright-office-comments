I do not beleive that works authored or co-authored by generative ai systems should be available for copyright. I beleive the businesses creating these generative models should be held responsible in attaining express permission to use the work of copyright holders in their training data, ideally through opt-in programs. In accordance with this, businesses which seek to use the biometric data of their employees for use in generative ai models must also attain strict written permission.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as a citizen of the United States, I firmly believe that it is in the best intrest of the general populace that text, images, videos, and audios generated by these systems be subject to unique identifiers that label them as such. For example, these works could contain disclaimers about how they were created or they could include identifiable watermarks. This could potentially help protect consumers. Thank you.
