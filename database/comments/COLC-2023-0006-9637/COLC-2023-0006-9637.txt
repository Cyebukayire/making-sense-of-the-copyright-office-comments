AI algorithms are trained off of massive quantities of data, most of which consist of works whose creators did not give permission or consent for their works to be used in said algorithms. The algorithms then patch fragments of these works together to create something that mimics an original piece, but often include unique features of the works it was trained on. Works created with AI should not be copyrighted, since they are the product of so many different artists, most of whom don&#39;t know their work is being used this way.
