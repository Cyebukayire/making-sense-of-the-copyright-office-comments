&ldquo;Artificial Intelligences&rdquo; are essentially just complex automation. <br/><br/>Automation of every sort must serve one purpose, and one purpose only: to materially improve the lives of people. Automation that actually materially worsens the lives of people not only should not exist, but must not exist. Legislation and government enforcement are by far the most powerful tools that people have in fighting to ensure that all automations materially improve the lives of people, and to the greatest extent that they can.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s important to further define what it means for lives to be materially improved. First, any good that it causes must be tangible and not just notional. For example, it does not benefit mankind simply to &ldquo;advance technology&rdquo; or &ldquo;make life easier&rdquo; or &ldquo;create efficiency&rdquo; or &ldquo;make this before someone else does&rdquo; or other nebulous terms. Second, any automation must improve individual lives much more than it harms them for a net positive. Third, it must improve vastly more lives than it harms. Finally, any harm that it causes must be incidental and remediable. <br/><br/>We have implicitly enforced these concepts for millennia, and yet now we see software companies and individual developers challenging these notions without even considering the consequences.<br/><br/>When it comes to AI and copyright, we run into several enormous problems:<br/>-Current AI is trained on material that directly violates existing notions of copyright.<br/>-Allowing rampant AI development and use without strong copyright enforcement leads to conditions where human writers will be unable to practice their profession, leading to the mutual destruction of human writing and AI writing, as AI writing depends on being forever fed new material created by humans.<br/>-Without stronger protections around things created by individuals, the consolidation of ownership will continue into the hands of fewer and fewer super-rich, super-powerful people and the corporations they use as their tools. This is made far worse by AI because there is no natural limit to what a computer can steal and remix from humans.<br/><br/>Please consider doing or advocating for the following:<br/>-Make all AI-generated art, literature, music, etc. ineligible for copyright.<br/>-Require creators submitting copyright claims to declare that AI was not used for the creation of the item in question.<br/>-Require companies that make machine learning tools to gain the express permission of every single creator or individual whose work is used to train the software.<br/>-Require that all machine learning tools and companies cite all sources used for machine learning, under threat of banning the software and levying massive punishments.<br/>-Forbid, by law, any contract or terms of use from allowing machine learning based on a user&rsquo;s data or work as part of a larger end-user license agreement. All contracts for use of a person&rsquo;s material for machine learning must be exclusive to that transaction.<br/>-Require, by law, a legally-enforced standard royalty for the permitted re-use of any person&rsquo;s work using AI.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration, I appreciate your interest in this policy decision.<br/>
