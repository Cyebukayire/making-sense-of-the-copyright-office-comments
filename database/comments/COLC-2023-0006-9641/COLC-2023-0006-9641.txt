The use of AI to generate content depends on ripping off the work of others. These programs do not create &quot;original&quot; work, rather they use what already exists to attempt to make something and they do not understand the patterns they try to replicate, leading to error and repetition and lack of memory of its own content.<br/>AI, by nature, steals works already existing, including copyrighted works or original artwork and literature. This in itself is a theft from creators and companies; It is taking advantage of what would otherwise be protected. If an artist or illustrator were to steal from the same copyrighted content, action would be taken against them, and I think this should also apply to AI generators rather than letting them off the hook.<br/>This is unavoidable though and hence AI should not be allowed copyright rights. It would be similar to attempting to copyright a store brand version of a brand item, like Krispy Rice being a store brand of Rice Krispies. <br/>The rise of AI generators lack real substance and effort that artists put into their work. Giving them validity and rights and copyright would allow them to far surpass artists and even put them out, leaving a lifeless version of what used to have detail and effort.<br/><br/>AI is surface level. There is no human detail or emotion or effort beneath it. And we shouldn&#39;t treat it that way. I fully reject allowing copyright of AI generated work. Thank you.
