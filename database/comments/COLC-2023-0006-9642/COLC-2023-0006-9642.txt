AI as it is right now, and as it is being used right now, is a danger to creative endeavors everywhere. It takes almost no time to look into the current state of AI and see that the current databases are absolutely stuffed with stolen, copyrighted material. There is currently no recourse for artists to remove their work from these databases, with many hosts actively refusing. Companies are already getting rid of their creative teams to replace them with AI generators, destroying jobs and gutting entire industries. It&#39;s important to note that these systems don&#39;t even work as intended right now -- one example being an eating disorder therapy group replacing live chat with an AI, only for the AI to then start telling blatant lies and recommending dieting tips, which caused immense harm to those attempting to use the service.<br/><br/>When it comes to education, the use of AI has become a shorthand for students to submit essays, which means that professors have had to adapt by creating more complicated and ridiculous methods to ensure academic honesty. Not only does AI need to be legislated for the safety of artists who are having their work stolen, it needs to be legislated to ensure that our universities can handle what is rapidly becoming the biggest &quot;cheat&quot; we&#39;ve probably ever seen. <br/><br/>That alone is a problem that needs to be legislated to protect copyright holders and their intellectual property, but beyond that is the issue of &quot;deep-fakes&quot; -- the act of using AI to create convincing misinformation. I believe that this is the most dangerous part of AI. There have already been examples of people creating fake news stories with AI generated images that stir up panic and outrage on social media, as well as the generation of deep-fake pornography wherein a person&#39;s image is stolen and falsely recreated as pornography. There is also the issue of AI generated voices that steal the voices of real people and create clips that can defame the character of the impacted person. <br/><br/>The potential for harm is astronomical and it has ALREADY done immense harm, socially, financially, and creatively.
