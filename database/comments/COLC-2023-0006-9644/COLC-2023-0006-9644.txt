I am opposed to AI being granted copyright for several reasons.<br/><br/>First, they&#39;re &quot;trained&quot;/created using materials these companies never licensed for this purpose. There&#39;s already requirements for software license regarding use of another company&#39;s code, there&#39;s no reason to differentiate between a software library or art assets here. And there&#39;s absolutely no reason any of these AI toys should not have a full accounting of all that they are &quot;trained&quot; on, and permission to use from the copyright holders. It may be an onerous burden to their business plan, but their plan didn&#39;t involve crediting artists or paying license fees... so it was never intended to follow existing laws and regulations.<br/><br/>Second, there have already been instances of an artist streaming their process online, and someone taking an image from the stream and feeding it into an AI toy, and claiming the actual artist is imitating the result, which was created by stealing from the artist in the first place. This would be a nightmare for your office as the AI products would be finished faster than the real art.<br/><br/>Third, the &quot;AI&quot; works, even if they were created ethically, did not include in training or input any infringing material... once no humans produce art, the only thing they can &quot;train&quot; upon is work from other &quot;AI&quot;, and we&#39;re already seeing that produce some amusingly awful results. And it will drive humans to stop sharing art online, and what company would pay a human for creative work if it weren&#39;t forced to? Take a look at the writer&#39;s strike of today, and remember that the &quot;ChatGPT&quot; and its type simply can not write worth a damned.<br/><br/>There is no benefit to society from granting these things copyright or legitimacy, and substantial harm.
