AI generated art should not be considered as being eligible for copyright protection. Artificial intelligence is incapable of producing art without using art from millions of pieces of work created by human beings, and as such, I would think that AI generated artwork could be considered a copyright infringement. If somebody makes artificial intelligence &ldquo;create&rdquo; something, I do not think the person who &ldquo;created&rdquo; the piece of work should be able to legally claim it as theirs&mdash; the AI had to pull from so much content to create such a piece of work that does not belong to the user.
