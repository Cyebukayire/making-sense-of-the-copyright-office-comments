I personally believe that a work should involve a higher degree of human input (beyond producing prompts) to warrant a copyright claim. Additionally, many AI engines such as Dall-e and ChatGPT source their products through outside input. As of now it is very difficult for artists and photographers to know for certain if their work is being used to train these engines or how to be fairly compensated for their work if it is. If a copyrighted work is something that has been stolen from another copyrighted work, then it should not be copyrighted to begin with.
