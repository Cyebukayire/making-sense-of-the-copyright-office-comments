I appreciate the Copyright Office for opening up this topic for public comment. I create my living through art and writing, and rely on the monetization of my work to survive. As well, I am part of many artistic communities which promote and support other artists like myself. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution requires Congress pass laws &ldquo;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo; Allowing generative AI to train on copyrighted works without fairly compensating artists for the right to their intellectual properties is inconsistent with the Constitution. The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.  This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.  Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright. The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training. Thank you for your time and consideration of these important matters, this issue affects artists across many different mediums and I hope you will hear their voices.
