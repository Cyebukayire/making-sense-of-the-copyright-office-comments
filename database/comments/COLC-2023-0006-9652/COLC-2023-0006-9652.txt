let authors specify which of their artworks can be used for AI training and which cannot. People would then only be allowed to train AI models on the permitted artworks.<br/><br/>This is likened to how Disney does not allow derivative works to be made from its characters. People can learn from these characters as much as they want, but they can&#39;t upload creations based on them.<br/><br/>The idea is that learning could be freely allowed, but during the monetization process, it should be checked whether the model was trained on permitted artwork. If not, distribution and monetization should be prohibited.
