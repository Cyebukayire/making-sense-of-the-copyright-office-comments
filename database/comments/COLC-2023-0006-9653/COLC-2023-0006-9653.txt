As a hobbyist who has been interested in AI for several years, generative AI is very important to me as an interest, but I understand that it needs regulation. <br/><br/>I believe that works by an image generating AI should only be able to be copyrighted if manually altered by a human (ex. Through paintovers, redraws, or heavy image editing) <br/><br/>I believe that artists should be able to opt out of AI training on their art. However, this may be hard to enforce, as AI models do NOT contain any of their source images directly.<br/><br/>I believe that voices in general should not be copyrighted. Anyone should be free to use an AI voice trained on anything, as it is imperfect and akin to a human impressionist doing a voice.<br/><br/>I believe that major corporations using AI to replace human workers is incredibly questionable, but hobbyists using AI for their own purposes is almost always fine.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m filling this out right, but thank you for your time!
