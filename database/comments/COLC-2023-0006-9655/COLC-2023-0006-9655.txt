My name is Anya Meksin and I am a TV Writer currently on strike in Los Angeles. One of the issues that led to this strike (and the resulting billions in losses to the American economy) is the refusal of major studios to safeguard our work from being gobbled up and regurgitated by AI models before being used to permanently put us out of business. If the use of AI in the entertainment industry goes unregulated, the entire class of working writers, actors, directors, and countless others will cease to be able to make a living from our art, with disastrous cultural ramifications for society at large. Do we want to live in a world where stories are generated by machines by amalgamating previously told stories in infinite meaningless combinations? Why can&#39;t AI be used to solve some of the world&#39;s problems that humans can&#39;t solve? Why must it be used to increase profits for the CEOs and shareholders of massive corporations at the expense of the vast majority of human beings? That is not progress. It is exploitation. AI models plagiarize our work, but drain that work of meaning. We all deserve much better than to be fed meaningless machine-generated drivel because corporations are too greedy to pay real artists to enlighten us with their hard-earned vision. And the plight of entertainment workers is just the canary in the coal mine for the effect of AI on other industries. The government must step in urgently to prevent mass unemployment across vast sectors of society. People want to work. They don&#39;t want AI doing their work for them--instantaneously and for free--so corporations can profit.
