I firmly believe that any content generated by an &quot;AI&quot; cannot and should never be copyrighted. Copyright laws exist to protect human creators and their projects, not regurgitated conglomorations of other people&#39;s work. If it is not created by a human, it cannot be copyrighted. This is true of octopuses photographing themselves and for elephants leaving lines on paper, which are inherently more intelligently crafted than the so called artificial intelligence, so it should remain true for programs as well.
