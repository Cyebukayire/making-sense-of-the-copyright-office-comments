Until AI can become something more than sophisticated plagiarism and is not used and abused by corporations looking to cheat the originators of the words, video, audio, and images that has been used to train the machine learning it should not be allowed to be treated or copyrighted as original work. As it is, AI models take in millions of points of data and reconfigure them to the whims of a prompt, but just as musicians must credit samples in new works of music, AI programs should be forced to name their sources and credit them. If that art is being used to make money, the original creators of the art should get a cut. AI art, writing, and music should not be able to be copyrighted as it is not the work of a group or individual but is rather a mosaic with pieces too small and blurred to be discerned and may be made of copyrighted works themselves.
