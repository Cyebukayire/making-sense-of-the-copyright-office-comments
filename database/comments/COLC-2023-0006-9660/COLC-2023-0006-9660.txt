I feel like AI art is going to ruin everything we hold in the industry in general. As an inspired artist, I feel like it threatens my dream and the dreams of other artists alike. Everyday in Twitter,  it gives more and more of a bleak future of what the future of art would look like. Cold un inspire future where feelings of motivation repetiveness reigns supreme. Plus, AI is built upon the blood and sweat of other artist to make their beautiful drawings too. Their should regulations to AI. Right now, it&#39;s already giving why it needs to be regulated, its exploiting everyones hard work. We the people must say no to AI.
