AI developers chose to enter into the creative domain and take content that is copyright protected to train their applications based on existing writer&#39;s and artists&#39; content without getting their consent prior to doing so, and per the creative commons laws is against the intellectual property rights of those same writers. The only content that over 100 years old is permissible to be taken and adapted for use in the creation of another writer&#39;s published works unless explicit permission is granted to another entity to utilize a work and licensure for that purpose is provided. Because the creators of this technology did not ask for such explicit permission from any of the works that were used by their program in the training of the AI&#39;s creation there exists a severe lack of accountability and there is no one person who is clearly identifiable as the responsible party nor the creator of the content that AI produces. This causes a rift in both giving proper credit and payment to original human creators and the legal repercussions that would normally befall another human creator for plagiarizing another creator&#39;s content. This alone makes AI use for the creation of writing and production of art dangerous due to it being able to easily steal from others without there being anyway for those creators to ask for cease and desist orders or to protect their own original intellectual property. This means the only party (ies) that can be held accountable are the very developers of the AI who failed to seek permission prior to training and programming this technology which has since gone on to commit infringement violations on multiple persons and creative entities.
