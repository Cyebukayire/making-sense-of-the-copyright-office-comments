This topic is of great importance to me as a professional artist, and I hope this reaches you well.<br/><br/>Artistic endeavors have historically relied on human effort, skill, and intent. The meticulous planning, design, and transformation of existing pieces into something new and unique are the hallmarks of artistic creation. Even for art such as collages that involve the use of others&#39; imagery, there is still a considerable amount of effort, design, planning, skill, and human expression involved in taking those pieces and transforming them in a way that is entirely new and unique -- plus there is a recognizable appearance to the result that lets it be easily known to the viewer that the process involved unoriginal works, and it is understood that the work done was putting them together in an interesting way, not that the collage pieces themselves were originally made.<br/><br/>AI introduces a paradigm shift by instantly amalgamating elements from millions of images with minimal human intervention. Tools like Img2Img and ControlNet leverage existing images as a foundation, making it effortless for AI to derive entirely new creations. For context, Img2Img denoises from a specified image, and ControlNet takes images and &quot;controls&quot; the output to follow it as a guideline in various ways such as following edges of objects, or copying the depth perceived by the AI from an image. It is thus very easy to use copyrighted works, input in various ways such as these, on top of training a model on copyrighted works. With all these combined, it can become incredibly obfuscated, yet the outcome can take very little effort or even understanding of the image being generated.<br/><br/>In the realm of traditional image editing with software like Photoshop, technical alterations, such as applying filters, can yield different visual outcomes. For example, I can use filters which &quot;stylize&quot; an image. However, the original image remains identifiable, albeit altered, and it would be deceptive to present this as an original piece. One may recognize that it is not original and that it is just an edit in Photoshop.<br/><br/>This is not usually the case with AI-generated art, as it can create entirely new compositions that lack any trace of the original sources.<br/><br/>Digital editing tools like Photoshop have already reduced the effort required to transform images significantly. AI further accelerates this trend by automating the creative process to an unprecedented degree. This automation raises questions about the value of creative labor and the potential devaluation of artistic effort as we see a drastic increase in AI-generated content.<br/><br/>When AI models are trained on vast datasets of images, the original sources are effectively &quot;compressed&quot; into the model&#39;s parameters, making it nearly impossible to trace the origins of the individual components. Those who train these models do not need to retain the data they are training the model on, and can essentially use data to train the model, and destroy the original data. Traditional copyright enforcement relies on identifying sources, which becomes exceedingly challenging when AI-generated art lacks recognizable patterns or watermarks. This untraceability renders most AI-generated works practically unprotectable and thus threatens creators&#39; rights.<br/><br/>On a tangential note, this is problematic in terms of data privacy and laws regarding this, as one could claim they do not hold your data when they are not supposed to, although it could be permanently trained into a dataset for AI to use, from art all the way to identification of individuals (i.e. facial recognition). I have also seen that there is also the idea of putting these into a blockchain that is uncontrolled in the way that Bitcoin functions, so that it may never be deleted or otherwise altered.<br/><br/>AI models are now being trained on specific artists&#39; works without their consent. This differs fundamentally from artists studying and imitating other artists&#39; techniques. AI directly copies and combines patterns from existing works - whereas an artist generally would not take the images directly and cobble them together, but rather dissect the image in a way that they can recreate it using tools like paint or digital paint, additionally AI does this without any human input of how to cobble them together like a human would with a collage.<br/><br/>As AI technology advances, it may extend beyond static images to interactive media like video games. In this hypothetical scenario, independent video game developers could invest years of hard work in creating a unique game, only to have a large corporation use AI to replicate their creation swiftly. This &quot;new&quot; game would be devoid of the creative effort invested by the original developer, akin to a student altering a paper just enough to evade plagiarism detection. This scenario underscores the importance of protecting creators&#39; rights in a digital landscape where AI can easily replicate their work.<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your time.
