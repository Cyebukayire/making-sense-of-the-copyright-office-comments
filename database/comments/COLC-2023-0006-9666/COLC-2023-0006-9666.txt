While in some edge cases there should be copyright given to an &quot;author&quot; such as when a program is trained using data or works that originated from the author looking to receive a copyright, usually copyright should not be provided to &quot;AI&quot; produced works. This opinion stems from the way many &quot;AI&quot; models are trained using data not belonging to the author and therefore the produced works of an &quot;AI&quot; trained as such are not original content.
