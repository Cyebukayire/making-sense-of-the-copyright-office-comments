I believe that any &quot;work&quot; that is &quot;created&quot; by an A.I. program in inherently different from work created by a Human. The fact that A.I. takes (for lack of a better description) literal bits and pieces from other works and knits them together into their product makes any A.I. art a nightmare to properly accredit to the original creators and obfuscates what amounts to creative theft. It takes with impunity, and does not &quot;create&quot; in the way a human does. When a human creates, yes they draw from a lifetime of creative influences, but the intangible essence of being human transforms those influences into new expression - even when the artist is attempting to mimic or evoke other&#39;s work. To claim the intangible essence of humanity doesn&#39;t seem like the logical way to explain the difference, but we are discussing the nature of Art here, and Art is inherently human and thus doesn&#39;t fall into strict, logical parameters. In the same way Justice Potter Stewart&#39;s claim &quot;I know it when I see it,&quot; makes it a human&#39;s decision to define whether or not a piece of media is or is not obscene, you must to acknowledge that same grey-area when discussing the nature of creative works as a whole. What is art without the human element? If no person has processed thoughts and ideas in the unknowable space that makes us human, and turned that into creative decisions, then what is the outcome? Not art. Merely a simulacrum - no thoughts, no &quot;soul.&quot; Some may claim that the person who creates an A.I. program is the &quot;author&quot; of a work the A.I. generates, but I disagree. Whatever an A.I. generates, no matter who controls the A.I., is still an empty collage of stolen parts. The A.I. program, it self, is a created work - built by a human making choices - but the A.I. is not creating, merely simulating via creative thievery. Do NOT allow A.I. generated content to be copyrightable, to do so is to grant clemency on stolen goods masquerading as legitimate.
