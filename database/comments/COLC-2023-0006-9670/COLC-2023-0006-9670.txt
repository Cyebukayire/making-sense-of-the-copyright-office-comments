I am of the opinion that AI should not be legally distinct from any other form of technologically-generated content. Computers have been used for decades as tools to assist humans in creating things. Recent AI breakthroughs are a very useful and impressive new technology, but ultimately it&#39;s just a better version of previous tools, and legally I don&#39;t see why there is any difference between the old and the new.<br/><br/>While AI does usually work by scanning and compiling material from the Internet - which could raise some concerns of theft - I should point out that humans also take inspiration from each other&#39;s work all the time, and no one calls this theft. An artist who has never seen a tree before would not be able to draw one, and when one draws a picture of a tree, it would be unfair to ask them to compensate anyone who has ever shown them a tree.
