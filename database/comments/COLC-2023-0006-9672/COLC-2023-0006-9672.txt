AI is plagiarism software, by design. It cannot be allowed to be copyrighted because there is nothing original to what it creates, by definition. A computer cannot create, it can only repeat, and much of what it is repeating is being collected at a rate where consumers will struggle to not have their words used. Software already purchased now has clauses stating we must use AI or forfeit use of the product we already purchased... website we mus use work work, programs out jobs require are now stating our words and voices will be stolen from us, and we not only get no royalty for this theft, or payment of any sort. It violates what the copyright office stands for and its noble and important mission.
