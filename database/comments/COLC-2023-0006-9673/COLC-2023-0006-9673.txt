AI art has no right to be considered copyrightable. Not only is it not made by a human, it also learns by using other people&rsquo;s art in order to improve itself. It takes the work of other creators in order to create art, which in and of itself is theft. The many artists I have known have had their art used in AI unwillingly and do not endorse the use of AI. Not only is it disrespectful, it will put many people out of a job. An AI should not be used in the place of a human being just to save a quick buck and to bypass the use of theft.
