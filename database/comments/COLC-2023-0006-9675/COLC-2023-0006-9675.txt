I have several months of experience with both visual and text-based AI generation, and do not believe the user of any such services has a claim to copyright over the content they generate. The user is manipulating data from existing copyrighted content (books, artwork, etc.); the process is legally similar to an automated version of Photoshop. Given these tools can easily mimic the styles of the existing creators they were trained on (e.g. &quot;an essay in the style of Malcolm Gladwell&quot;), and given that two separate people putting in the same prompt could generate identical works, the content produced cannot be construed as new or original, and therefore cannot be copyrighted; at most, the copyright could be held by the company owning the AI program. The use of these programs does not constitute a creative process, and should not benefit from copyright protections.
