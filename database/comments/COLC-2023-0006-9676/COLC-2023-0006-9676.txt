My name is Lisa Haney, and I&rsquo;m a freelance illustrator living in Boulder, Colorado. I&rsquo;ve made my living as an artist for nearly four decades, working for newspapers like the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and too many magazines to mention. The issue of AI is obviously very important to me; I believe copyright protection is essential for the creative economy of the USA.<br/><br/>This new technology could be useful for medical applications (radiologists, genetic mapping), for the purposes of text generation, and for generating programming code. None of these require copyrighted data for training.<br/><br/>You have probably already read this paper from the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) &ldquo;AI Art and its Impact on Artists&rdquo;: <br/><br/>&lt;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3600211.3604681&gt;<br/><br/>&ldquo;In summary, we advocate for regulation that prevents organizations from using people&rsquo;s content to train image generators without their consent, funding for AI research that is not entangled with corporate interests, and task specific works in well defined domains that serve specific communities&rdquo;<br/><br/>For me, this is a reasonable solution, and most productive uses of the technology would not be affected.<br/><br/>Regarding the more &lsquo;creative&rsquo; generated material, these systems rely heavily on copyrighted data, and fail the &lsquo;fair use&rsquo; test by competing directly with working artists, writers, and actors. Depending on how tightly the algorithm is fit, they may not be sufficiently transformative..<br/><br/>This unregulated technology has already begun affecting artists. We see the SAG-AFTRA strike. People contributing to stock illustration websites have reported a drop in sales; as clients use plagiarized versions of their art, rather than paying the creators.<br/><br/>I was not surprised to find dozens of my images in the training data. Using the website &lt;https://haveibeentrained.com/&gt;, artists may &lsquo;opt out&rsquo; their images. This requires dragging picture files onto the search bar and looking through pages of results; since I have created over 2,500 illustrations in my career, I have only begun to scratch the surface.<br/><br/>Once the images are &lsquo;opted out&rsquo; (AI companies are not legally required to abide by this request), they may be re-scraped from the internet in the future. Under this system, I am required to do this unpaid labor forever, if I don&rsquo;t wish to compete against an algorithm derived from my own copyrighted works (which AI advocates refer to as my &ldquo;style&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s a mechanical derivation, despite the fuzzy language).<br/><br/>As the AI rolled out this past spring, I was preparing my images to sell on stock illustration websites. Now I need to rethink that, and perhaps forego the passive income from my images, to which I own the copyright, lest I &ldquo;feed the machine&rdquo; that will replace me. I will try to protect them with metatags (which may or may not be respected), and try to use Glaze (https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/), which supposedly protects them, but degrades the image quality, and takes time. This is all quite discouraging, and time-consuming.<br/><br/>For this reason, I believe AI models should be strictly &lsquo;opt-IN&rsquo;, as suggested by the ACM. <br/><br/>The question of &ldquo;just compensation&rdquo; highlights the fact that these generative AI programs were rolled out, free of charge, to the public in a purposefully premature way. I knew people working with LLMs twenty years ago , in an academic setting, and they were keenly aware of copyright issues. I don&rsquo;t think this institutional knowledge was &lsquo;lost&rsquo;; these new commercial players in the market chose to rely on &lsquo;proof of concept&rsquo; popularity to jump over potential legal hurdles before they could be erected.<br/>&ldquo;Move Fast, Break Laws&rdquo;, one might say. <br/><br/>I have heard in Senate hearings that the corpus of data is too large to assign compensation. These are some of the brightest minds working in technology. With time, they can devise a tracking mechanism to determine which works are referenced, at what percentage, and compensate proportionally. If you look at the data sets (using haveibeentrained.com), you see that a lot of the data is useless: low-quality fuzzy images, scans of text, pornography, etc. When they say they have hundreds of millions of images in the corpus, know that many of these images are not being referenced.<br/><br/>Alternatively, artists who &lsquo;opt-in&rsquo; could receive a monthly stipend based on how many works are accepted into the model, and the artists might renegotiate their contract with each new model build.<br/>Were we to leave it to artists to individually mount legal challenges to generated works that are too closely trained on their data, the Federal Courts could be swamped. Or, more likely, artists, writers and actors will simply move to other professions, finding the cost of legal representation too high; and the business of competing with their own work too demoralizing.<br/>Intellectual property is a big part of the US economy, and should enjoy the protection of Copyright.<br/><br/>
