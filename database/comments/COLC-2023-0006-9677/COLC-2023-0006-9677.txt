I believe that AI data bases should not be able to use copywritten material without the creator of the copyrighted material agreeing to it before hand. AI companies are in competition with artists. If artists do not have the right to deny AI to train on their material then they will not be able to compete with AI&rsquo;s level of output. Having to manually go to every AI data base and request they not use their copyrighted material is, functionally, denying artists this. One can barely keep up with the AI companies popping up, let alone track each one down to submit an opt out request. This also does nothing to prevent companies from simply creating a new &ldquo;company&rdquo; when it has too many opt-out requests.  <br/><br/>AI companies are also posed to negatively impact the art market. Artists must factor the number of hours they spent on a piece when pricing it. If a buyer is not able to identify an artwork that took twenty hours to complete verse an artwork that twenty seconds than the latter can control the pricing of artwork. AI artists can claim to have made someone by hand then sell the piece at a reduce price because they have no labor costs to account for. I fear that unregulated AI will lead to artists priced out of the art market because they cannot compete price wise with AI that is being passed off as handmade art. <br/><br/>I&rsquo;m sure you have received many comments about AI art being used to mimic real people. Attorney Generals across the country are already concerned about child porn of real children being created with AI (1). This mimicry is a huge concern that I&rsquo;m sure other people have more thoroughly explained to you. Instead, I will be focusing on another aspect of AI: its harmful impact on artistic reputations. <br/><br/>The author, Jane Friedman, experienced an example of AI impersonation. (2) AI books were posted to Amazon under her name and it wasn&rsquo;t until she went to social media that the books were removed. AI promises that it is either indistinguishable from human art or will be soon. Unless regulations are put in place that prevent AI from labeling itself as human made, artists are going to be one accusation away from having their reputations as artists ruined. <br/>Open AI has already admitted that none of the AI Detection tools available actually work (3). Jane Friedman was able to beat the claims only because the gap between AI and her work is noticeable. Other artists have voiced problems with being labeled as AI because it is aping their style. New artists are in danger of being abled as fakes because the flaws in their art is also things that AI has trouble reproducing. AI needs to be visible labeled as AI and no company or person will do this unless it is demanded of them by law. If the government does not do this, then no artists will be able to do what is vital for their careers: establish and maintain their reputation. <br/>Artists live and die on their artistic reputation. We see movies because we recognize the actors, and we pick up books because we recognize the author. We also stop seeing actors if they give a bad performance and drop authors that write bad books. Even ruling out malicious impersonation as in Jane Friedman&rsquo;s case, AI mimicry is a huge risk for artists. One just needs to look at the movies that have &ldquo;resurrected&rdquo; dead actors via AI to see what kind of damage could be done to a still living actor&rsquo;s reputation. Audiences are going to look at an actor&rsquo;s AI double, think &ldquo;what a shoddy job,&rdquo; and then write that actor off. <br/><br/>Which brings me to my greatest fear of AI. I do not fear it will keep me from writing books. Frankly, nothing could do that. What I do fear is selling a novel to a publishing house and them feeding it through an AI data base to produce five sequels. I fear that I will be faced with explaining to my fans that I had nothing to do with the sequels. That I will have to fight the &ldquo;bad movie adaptation&rdquo; stigma for my books. I fear that I will have to deny writing racist books because the AI included white supremacist doctrine. I fear that I will walk into a bookstore and see &ldquo;FROM THE UNIVERSE OF PYLE-CARTER&rsquo;S AWARD WINNING NOVEL: BOOKS 2-7&rdquo; and know none of them are mine and I won&rsquo;t see a penny. <br/><br/>AI needs to be regulated. AI art cannot be copywrited. Its data bases need to be opt in only and its outputs need to be labeled as AI in a way that cannot be removed from the output. Unless the government takes these steps then artists will not be able to make careers out of producing art. <br/><br/>Citations are in the attached word doc.<br/>
