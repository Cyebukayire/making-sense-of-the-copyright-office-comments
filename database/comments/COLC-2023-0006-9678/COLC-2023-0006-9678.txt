Thank you for investigating the opinion of the public on this matter. Regulation of the use of Artificial Intelligence is currently needed and relevant to your office.<br/>I am someone who supports authors and artists, and who believes it is important to create an environment where artists can continue their work.<br/>Current policy permits authors exclusive rights to their works for a limited time period, being the period the work is under copyright. Article One of the Constitution promotes artists&#39; work by requiring authors and artists be given the exclusive right to the content of their creations. Allowing generative AI to train on copyrighted works without the permission of the authors is inconsistent with the Constitution.<br/>The Copyright Office should find that training Artificial Intelligence on copyrighted works violates the Copyright Act and infringes upon those rights belonging to the creator.<br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in opening the discussion to public comments.
