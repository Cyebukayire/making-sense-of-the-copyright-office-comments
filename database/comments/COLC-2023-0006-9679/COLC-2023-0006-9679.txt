I&#39;m an artist in the video game industry and am in danger of having AI replace me and my coworkers at our jobs.  I don&#39;t mind using it as a tool, but it should remain without copyright.  All the images that they used to make the image based AI&#39;s were stolen from artists both large and small- people who will probably never be compensated but should be.  Small artists are barely hanging in there to survive.  Either AI art remains without copyright or ya&#39;ll need to get that universal basic income going so we don&#39;t lose our jobs enmasse.  I&#39;m terrified of that future.  Not just for me and my family, but for the sheer anger the least of us will wield.
