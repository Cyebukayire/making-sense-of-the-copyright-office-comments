One of the main concern of the use of generative AI regarding copyrights has been the infringement of copyrights. If the copyright owners use blockchain technology and NFTs  to authenticate and register the work it would be possible for the copyright holder to &quot;trace&quot; his/her/its rights on the web and specially know if the AI tool used the work to generate new work. Considering that, I believe we should start using blockchain technology and NFTs to register IP works and specially for copyright purposes.
