As a professional artist, I am seeing not only my work but my coworker&#39;s work being fed to an algorithm without our consent, programmed by some tech company that sees art as content and resold to me as some disgusting cheap knockoff. seeing my work turned into some Frankenstein monster and belittled as some party trick not only sickens and insults me but worries me that my job and skills are about to become obsolete. all because some tech bro decided they could steal my art and years of work and try to repackage it to me. its illegal, insulting, and immoral. do something for once government
