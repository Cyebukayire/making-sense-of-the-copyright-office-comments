Hello,<br/><br/>I&#39;m a stunt performer in the entertainment industry. Since I was born, America has given corporations too many rights and given them free reign to grab rights in unregulated space. This gives them precedent and legal contracts for things they shouldn&#39;t have rights to. Until we have a large collection of grievances or a person with tremendous resources we do not get back that space in personal rights. <br/><br/>This goes into digital rights and the tech Corp takeover. Currently, most apps, websites, and technology scrape data from every user. If you take the time to read the fine print in any digital experience, the individual has lost almost all rights. The corporations are monopolizing the space because of lack of regulation. <br/><br/>With ai and the way it&#39;s trained and designed there should be no copyright options. It should be regulated before it&#39;s weaved into every fabric of our society. Otherwise there won&#39;t be any room left for citizens. <br/><br/>As a performer my digital assets are everything I am offering. If technology steals my face, voice, and movement (it already can and does) then I can&#39;t compete with myself. The company will have legions of performers they can mix and match to create unique performances and performers. They can charge whatever they want as they have an unlimited roster. Then I have to compete with my face being used in ads without permission. The way I move on someone&#39;s else&#39;s bones. And the way I sound being projected from someone else&#39;s throat. <br/><br/>This same form of transgression is happening to artists. Adobe has stolen artists styles and were selling their art. Adobe has global reach and a built in global audience. There was artists competing against themsleves, however, adobe&#39;s version had a global fanbase. <br/><br/>These companies have no interest in protecting individuals, but rather gaining every foothold to leverage themselves into higher stock prices. This is costing the individual and is one more form of value being siphoned from the lower class to the upper class. <br/><br/>We need to aggressively contain privatized rights of ai. We need to release pressure as it goes into something sustainable instead of giving them carte blanche to ruin industries and individuals and then leave the cost of cleanup to those that have been victimized. <br/><br/>Please help contain this wave. We have so many fronts to fight on, let&#39;s reinforce the front line on this subject to the point that we aren&#39;t overwhelmed with the possibilities.
