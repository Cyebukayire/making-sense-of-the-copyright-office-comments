Generative AI is a collage work and needs to credit all of the artists it is pulling from. If any work, that is generated by an ai engine, is used for profit or promotional purposes it must have the permission of the sourced artists or creators. It should follow copyright and ownership and plagiarism laws. Generative ai should not be a free pass to steal others work. I believe it should not be allowed to be used to generate revenue for anyone unless it is trained solely on their own work. Ie. If Stephen King were to train an AI on all of his current publish works and use it to generate more works that would be acceptable. For anybody else using it they would need to give him credit and royalties.
