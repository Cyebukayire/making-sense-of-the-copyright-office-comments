As a hard-working artist, for the last 30 years, I am offended that it&rsquo;s now possible for people to generate AI art, and actually call it their own artwork. I am further offended that my name is in the database to be used to generate such art; people can now put my name in there prompt to try to generate images similar to mine, or any other artist. deceased artist won&rsquo;t mind, but living ones certainly will.  <br/><br/>A recent court case, allowed a so-called artist to duplicate a photographer&rsquo;s portrait. The photographer thought they would surely win the case because the painting was identical, except flipped around. That is a bad sign of things to come if we allow people who generate AI images to call those images their own artwork and sell it for profit. <br/><br/>I won&rsquo;t lie. I have generated such images myself but when I share them, I always make sure to include that they were AI generated, and I don&rsquo;t call it MY artwork. How is entering a prompt into a search engine and seeing what the computer generates, based on a database of existing images made by actual working artists, art &rdquo;work&rdquo;? It isn&rsquo;t. Please don&rsquo;t allow this to happen.
