I am grateful for the opportunity to share my views on this issue with the Office and to respond to its call for public input. My name is Liin and I am an advocate for the rights and interests of authors and artists, and I believe that fostering artistic expression is vital for a free and open society. The Constitution grants Congress the power to enact laws &ldquo; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for  limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their  respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;  Allowing generative AI to use copyrighted works as training data without adequately compensating Authors for the Right to their Writings violates the constitutional mandate. The Copyright Office should uphold the principle that copyright infringement encompasses the use of generative AI on copyrighted works without the consent of the authors whose works are being used as training data. I appreciate your attention and deliberation on this crucial matter.<br/>
