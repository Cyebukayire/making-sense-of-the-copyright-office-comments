I believe that AI needs to have far more copyright restriction. Not only is AI generation only possible by submitting human art for machine learning that these artists usually don&#39;t consent to, it&#39;s easy to endanger someone&#39;s livelihood on not just an individual level but on a far more systemic scale. I use the term &quot;artist&quot; here loosely to refer to anyone in the arts, voice acting, regular acting, writing, drawing, music, etc., because the effect is the same. AI is capable of recreating an entire person, and there have already been cases of actors having their likeness already taken and used for AI to &quot;replace&quot; them. This isn&#39;t just a matter of people&#39;s copyright being protected, but also people&#39;s jobs and personal safety. If someone can take your  voice and face, they can now use you to say or do anything they want you to, without your consent, and even if they never did it. They could use this to slander you online, send it to all of your friends, family, place of employment, etc. And you can do nothing about it.
