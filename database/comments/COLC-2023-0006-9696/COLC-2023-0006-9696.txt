The primary role of AI, I believe, will be to expedite the production of human-originated ideas and visions, a tool to bring our creativity to life more efficiently. <br/>The integration of technology into my life as a fiction writer has been transformative. It has accelerated the development of story ideas, plotlines, and more, providing invaluable support. Additionally, it has helped identify issues in novels I&#39;ve previously started and has breathed life into ideas that have long sat dormant on my computer. In essence, it has become a reliable creative partner.<br/>I&#39;ve employed AI for a wide range of tasks, from simple paragraph rephrasing to crafting entire novels. AI&#39;s capabilities are vast. However, what I&#39;ve come to understand is this: AI is akin to a racehorse. It possesses immense power, but its effectiveness depends on the skill of the human guiding it. Without my continual human oversight, storylines meander, the plotting becomes lackluster, and dialogue is often insipid. For the final product to align with the human author&#39;s vision, intervention is indispensable at every step.<br/>Therefore, I struggle to comprehend the reluctance to copyright a creative work that was either partly or supposedly &quot;fully&quot; AI-generated. The truth is, there&#39;s no such thing as a wholly AI-generated product. All AI-generated works emerge from human guidance, reflecting human-originated thoughts or visions. Some argue that the crucial question is how much human guidance went into the product. But does it truly matter? Is it significant whether the human author had to prompt the AI only once or one hundred times? Does it matter whether the human author only needed to make minor tweaks or had to rewrite the entire work? In either scenario, the final product bears the unmistakable imprint of human direction.<br/>I&#39;d like to draw attention to the age-old human practice of hiring ghostwriters. Human ghostwriters operate under the direct supervision of their human employer, receiving pay to produce a work that align with the employer&rsquo;s specific vision. The collaboration continues until the employer is satisfied, and it is the employer who retains ultimate decision-making authority. Under current rules, once a ghostwritten literary work is complete, the human employer faces no difficulty in copyrighting it, even if they didn&#39;t write a single word of it. So, what distinguishes having a machine ghostwrite one&#39;s work from relying on a human for the same task? In both cases, a human agent originates ideas, offers guidance, and determines when the literary work is ready and complete.<br/>Turning to the controversy surrounding AI&#39;s use of published materials, I can only say that it parallels the way we learn as humans. This is exactly how we train our students. We have them study, analyze, and sometimes even emulate the work of established masters, both alive or long gone. In fact, the more successful students are at emulating a master, the more we praise them. So, why should our training of AI be any different, especially when our goal is to make AI more useful to us? <br/>Some might argue that AI either produces plagiarized text itself or makes it easy for its users to do so. The first concern reflects a lack of understanding as to how large language models function and the second is a fear that arises when any new and powerful tool is developed. The answer to both is a greater understanding of the nature of the tool, both its limitations and capabilities, a strong sense of responsibility among its users, and clear guardrails against abuse or misuse.<br/>Last but not least, regarding whether writers should be compensated for the use of their work in training AI, I firmly believe that such use should be registered and that creators should be financially compensated.
