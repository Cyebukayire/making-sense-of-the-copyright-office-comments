1) Regarding the use of copyrighted works to train AI models: as the Authors Guild has recently stated in an open letter, thousands of copyrighted works were used without compensation to or the permission of the original authors&mdash;in some cases from pirate sites that serve as a clearinghouse for stolen, uncompensated copyrighted works. <br/><br/>Saying that the AI models are &ldquo;learning&rdquo; from these books is a fatuous misrepresentation. Humans who read books and learn from them are not then able to reproduce text with perfect recall. And humans who read books are not legally allowed to steal uncompensated copies of copyrighted works, whether or not the purpose is to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; from them. <br/><br/>AI should not be legally allowed to incorporate work into their &ldquo;learning&rdquo; that a human is not legally allowed to incorporate. Given an AI&rsquo;s ability to perfectly reproduce or summarize text, authors should be allowed to opt in to having their work consumed and later regurgitated by an AI. As the author of 22 books, at least 7 of which have been stolen and used to train AI, I would not consent to such a use. <br/><br/>2) According to the US Copyright Office itself, copyrightable works are &ldquo;independently created by a human author and have a minimal degree of creativity.&rdquo; This statement alone eliminates works generated solely by AI from being eligible for copyright. <br/><br/>The contribution of a human giving prompts to an AI in order to generate an output does not rise to the level of authorship, and therefore a human should not be able to copyright such an output. Leaving aside the issue raised above&mdash;that these LLMs are trained on the uncompensated and uncredited work of human authors&mdash;a human telling an AI to create text within certain parameters has not &ldquo;authored&rdquo; any text. When an editor gives me feedback on one of my manuscripts, their suggestions do not entitle them to authorship credit. A human inputting parameters for text generation is similarly serving in an editorial function.
