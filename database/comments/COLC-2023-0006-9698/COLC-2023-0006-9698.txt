As a full-time author who writes both for myself and for others (in the form of ghostwriting), making AI work copyrightable would have an immediate and detrimental impact on my ability to make a living from my craft. If AI work becomes copyrightable, publishers would have no incentive to buy from human artists (because AI work would be &ldquo;free&rdquo; to generate). If they did still purchase some books from human writers (because AI&rsquo;s writing quality is still nowhere near the level of a human professional), they would pay less overall, and author advances are already significantly lower in comparison to just two decades ago (according to the Authors&rsquo; Licensing and Collecting Society, ALCS, author incomes have dropped 60% since 2006).<br/>I am not concerned about AI being able to write better than a human or that it will &ldquo;outperform&rdquo; us at our jobs. In fact, I find &ldquo;AI&rdquo; to be a misnomer&mdash;it is not, as of yet, intelligent. It is a glorified version of autocorrect which, when left to its own devices without human-generated content, collapses, as modeled in the Cornell University study, &ldquo;The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget.&rdquo;<br/>There is also the problem of bias. AI frequently reflects society&rsquo;s biases&mdash;take the chat bots that turned racist and sexist mere hours after being exposed to the internet, or the US healthcare algorithm that ranked Black patients&rsquo; illnesses as less serious than their white counterparts&rsquo; (Obermeyer, et al. (2019). Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations. Science.) <br/>Fictional works generated by these language models are prone to similar ingrained biases. By its nature, AI can only recombine and regurgitate what it is fed, which means that the overall body of artistic work it produces is derivative. Its use will have a negative impact, not just on creators and artists, but on the overall quality of art, media, and goods available for the public to consume.<br/>The publishing sector faces unique issues that will arise if AI text is deemed copyrightable. I believe we need legislation to address these issues, as well as cases where AI models are being trained on copyrighted material produced by artists and writers who did not give consent for their work to be utilized in this way. <br/>Upwards of 170,000 books were pulled to train BloombergGPT, EleutherAI&rsquo;s GPT-J, and Meta&rsquo;s generative AI, without permission from the authors, as revealed in The Atlantic&rsquo;s expose on book pirating and AI. My debut novel and its sequel were a part of this dataset, taken illegally and without my permission. I barely made enough money on those two books to live off for 6 months, after spending 2.5 years writing them and 9 years getting that publishing deal. Now, my books have been sucked into a content farm which is trying to train itself to replace me, and I get absolutely zero compensation.  <br/>Book piracy has been an increasing problem for decades. There are plenty of websites and Torrent channels where copyrighted material can be accessed illegally and scraped by AI models, and that will continue happening unless some protection can be put into place against this practice. <br/>Copyrighted material should not be allowed to be fed into AI training models without explicit permission from the owner of the copyright. Copyright owners should need to affirmatively consent (opt-in) to the use of their works for training materials, and the onus to seek such permission should fall to the companies creating the AI models. They should need to pay a reasonable royalty rate for any work thus utilized. Otherwise, companies building AI models are simply stealing human artists&rsquo; output for their own commercial gain, without any compensation owed to the original creator.<br/>Copyright protection for AI-generated material would not &ldquo;promote the progress of science and useful arts.&rdquo; If anything, it stifles such progress, reducing the whole of human artistic output to a circular feedback loop, producing nothing truly unique. If you are sick of watching the same remakes ad nauseam now, just wait. This is a moral, legal, and ethical issue which we cannot ignore. The decisions we make on this issue will shape the future&mdash;whether that future is one that supports artists and values human achievement, or one that turns human artists into mere cogs to be crushed, devalued, and fed into a machine.
