The unfettered use of AI is going to absolutely devastate all creative mediums and the individuals who work in that sector. Authors, and artists in every medium are being pushed out by subpar products created by computers directed by scam artists looking for a quick buck. Voice Over Artists are having their voices and livelihoods stolen, actors and actresses are at risk for losing their art to face filters plastered over CGI bodies, artists are being decimated by machines that can plagiarize brush stroke by brush stroke to create something &#39;new&#39;, and authors are dealing with thieves using AI to write artificial stories and articles, slapping an established author&#39;s name on it and taking the money and running while the author is left reeling without their rightful revenue and their reputation in shambles when the customer realizes they&#39;ve been duped. The only people that content creation like this helps, are giant multi-billion dollar businesses who just want a cheap way to make more buckets of money. The hard working artists are the ones that suffer. Please put a stop to thieves and money hoarders that are destroying the average person just trying to make ends meet using the skills they&#39;ve cultivated over years of hard work.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>
