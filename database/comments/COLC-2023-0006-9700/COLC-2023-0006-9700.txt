1. I suggest that the fair use doctrine be applied to the amount of a writer&#39;s or artist&#39;s work AI can legally use. Any amount over that would require the AI platform to pay writer/artist $1/per word for the amount of writer&#39;s work over fair use or the percentage of artist&#39;s work used.<br/> 2. I suggest that new requirements, when codified into law, be retroactive for 100 years prior to the codification.<br/>3. I suggest that writer/artist&#39;s work fall under the new law whether the work is under common law copyright or copyrighted per the copyright office.
