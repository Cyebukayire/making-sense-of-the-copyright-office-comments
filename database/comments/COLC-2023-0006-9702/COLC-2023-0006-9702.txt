My name is Jesus, and I&#39;d like to express my opinions about AI adoption:<br/>- How data is going to be collected, gathered and employed by corporations and institutions with the advent of AI.<br/>- How can we tackle/fight the bad side of AI (for example, generative AI for sex offenses)<br/>- How AI generated content can be copyrighted in the future, granting the status of author/creator to AI systems.<br/>- Whether synthetic data, created by generative algorithms, should be out of the scope of the copyright protection or not.<br/>- Develop a framework for maintain ethics, fairness and non discriminative policies.<br/>
