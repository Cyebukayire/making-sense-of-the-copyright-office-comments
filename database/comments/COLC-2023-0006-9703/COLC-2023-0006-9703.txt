Unregulated AI is theft, pure and simple.  Programs that scrape the internet for content and then use that content to generate new images or sounds steal from the creative works of others.  An artist who uploads their work to DeviantArt, Pinterest, Instagram, etc, to grow their portfolio and audience will have that content stolen by AI generators, despite the generator not having paid for their work.  This happens not only with artists, but writers who have had their words stolen by programs like Chat GPT, singers and actors who have had their voices stolen by AI generated songs, and more.  Not only this, but it floods creative spaces with stolen work, rendering them almost impossible to use for those of us who do not want to participate in art theft.
