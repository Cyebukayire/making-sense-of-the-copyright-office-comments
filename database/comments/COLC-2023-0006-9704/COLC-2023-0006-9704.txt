I&rsquo;m an artist and an author strongly in favor of broad AI training in the arts. I&rsquo;m a nonbinary transgender person and have had the experience of using AI art generators to make images of nonbinary and transgender people that do not exist in available stock image resources, and to represent characters it&rsquo;s hard for even many traditional artists to faithfully represent, based on human bias. While current AIs are still biased, based on biased training data, I believe that they would be much more biased if training data is limited to public domain images, of which there are very few transgender people represented in, or opt-in databases, which would also limit quality data available to fill this demographic image gap that AI can help to fill. <br/><br/>It&rsquo;s not safe for many transgender models to have their images used in stock photography, and many stock image photographers live in countries heavily biased against transgender people, but AI doesn&rsquo;t have those issues. Training models on databases from sites like Adobe and Shutterstock, too, pose similar problems with bias, as the images in their datasets feature extremely few transgender and even fewer nonbinary people represented in natural and flattering ways. The broader internet has many more images of transgender people available.<br/><br/>So I ask you to please consider the demographic gaps and needs that AI, trained on as broad of datasets as possible, can currently fill. I was able to put photorealistic transgender characters of color on the covers of my books using Midjourney AI, which is something I was not able to do before AI was available, as images for these characters did not exist. Books with transgender characters don&rsquo;t typically sell well enough to justify the expense of hiring professional artists and photographers, further limiting resources available to authors writing transgender fiction. It&rsquo;s my concern that if it&rsquo;s decided that databases containing copyrighted work can&rsquo;t be used to train AI, then people traditionally underrepresented in public domain and opt-in datasets would again be very underrepresented in what AI is capable to produce faithfully in their demographics, and options for visual representation would again be severely limited. <br/><br/>Right now, AI is helping to close visual demographic gaps and make possibilities for underrepresented groups that just weren&rsquo;t there before. But deciding that training isn&rsquo;t fair use and restricting training to very heavily biased public domain datasets could cause a lot of social harm, especially to those who most need equal representation. I believe AI has great ability to help with greater equality in visual mediums, art, and advertising, but only if the training is also inclusive.
