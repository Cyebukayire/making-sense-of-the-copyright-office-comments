As an avid reader, I wholeheartedly believe ALL reading materials need to be labeled as AI generated, AI assisted, etc. I have followed multiple authors who have utilized AI tools and pass it off as their own.<br/>This is dishonest, manipulative and shows these individuals have absolutely no moral character or values. <br/>I am pleading, hoping and praying for AI regulations as a consumer. I want to know when ANY materials myself or children read is created by a human being and not being &quot;prompted&quot; using artificial intelligence.
