I am an author, I write fiction - mostly Fantasy fiction. I have found ai to be very helpful in my writing. It&#39;s a great tool.<br/>As an author, I learned how to write by reading other books. That&#39;s how I learned to mold and create stories - from the great authors who preceded me. Ai learned in the same way. There&#39;s nothing at all wrong with that. Ai is accused, regularly, of plaigerism. I have never had any ai give me any sentence or phrase or paragraph that was directly from another book. I have tools that include plaigerism checkers, and nothing has ever been called out to me.<br/>I know a large number of neurodivergent authors who struggled to write before AI. These tools help them connect with their creativity.<br/>It would be shameful to take that from them.<br/>I use ai as if it were another author, asking it to find errors in my work (speeding up the editing process), and discussing story ideas with it to brainstorm before I write, it creates summaries for me and makes a list of all my characters, their relationships, where they live, their personalities... things I used to create in excel myself, but ai can do it for me quickly. I do NOT have ai write the story for me, I&#39;m the writer, ai is the tool that helps me create quicker by taking on the chores of writing: editing, spell checking, making sure I didn&#39;t leave a plot hole unanswered. It also helps me with marketing chores that I know little about - I just want to write!! And it&#39;s very good at that. Also at researching things to make sure I&#39;m representing thing correctly.<br/>It helps me in my email... I hit down what I want to say and ai formalizes it for me so it gets my point across more eloquently.<br/>This tool is a huge boon to authors.<br/>As to all of the hullabaloo about it training on books, all the books it trained in are either in the public domain or are free to the public via public libraries.<br/>If ai reads my books, I&#39;d be delighted!<br/>This technology has the capacity to be tremendously helpful to everyone. Are there those who may attempt to use it wrongly? Of course, just like everything else! I get scam scam phone calls - should we get rid of the telephone? I get phishing emails - should we get rid of the ability to email? Everyone needs to educate themselves against those types of things.<br/>Don&#39;t throw the baby out with the bath water. The companies I&#39;ve worked with, chiefly chatgpt and Anthropic (Claude2) but I&#39;ve played with others to compare... they have things in their process to stop people from using their programs in a bad way. Everyone should be looking at this together instead of panicking about progress. Ai has been around for years and years, it isn&#39;t going away. And, by the way, it is NOT really Artificial Intelligence. That&#39;s a misnomer. It&#39;s Machine Learning. They are computers, they aren&#39;t sentient.
