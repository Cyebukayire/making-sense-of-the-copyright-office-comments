I believe that AI needs to be regulated by the government. Often times with technology the government can take quite a bit of time to step on the ball. AI without regulation threatens not only artists (as we see with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes) but all kinds of careers and departments. Criminals may use AI to imitate the likeness of lawmakers or policymakers to spread propaganda. Stalkers can use their victims&#39; information via this service, artists can have their works appropriated and resold at a higher value than their own. AI regulation needs to be implemented in every sector, Intellectual property, government and even medicine. I hope that the U.S. takes AI seriously and thoroughly implements policies BEFORE the problem gets worse. Sometimes preventative lawmaking does more work than waiting for a trial to come before action is taken seriously. Thank you for taking the public&#39;s words into account.
