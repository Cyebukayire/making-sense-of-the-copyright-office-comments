Artificial intelligence software does nothing but create plagiarized art and writing. It scrapes existing art and literature, stealing the time, effort, and training of human writers and artists to make derivative trash. The products of AI plagiarized work should never be eligible for copywrite so that we can actively discourage companies from using it to profit without paying artists and writers.
