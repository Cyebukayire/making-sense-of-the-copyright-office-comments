I am a published author who has found the A.I. writing tools that emerged in January of this year to very helpful. I use these tools for editing and brainstorming ideas. What I am producing now with these tools is a combination of my ideas, the ideas my prompts in AI generate, and my own original writing. My first novel took me 3 years to write, and now at age 71, I am hoping these tools will help me to write more quickly. I see no reason why i should not be able to copywrite my finished books written with the help of AI tools.
