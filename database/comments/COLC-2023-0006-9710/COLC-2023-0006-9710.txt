I am a neurodivergent writer, AI tools are allowing me to write stories trapped in my head due to my language difficulties. I should be allowed to register copyright on my AI assisted stories, as they are MY ideas, but I need help to bring them forth and craft the prose. Those arguing against AI tools want to gatekeep writing and stop neurodivergent and disabled writers from being able to finish books.
