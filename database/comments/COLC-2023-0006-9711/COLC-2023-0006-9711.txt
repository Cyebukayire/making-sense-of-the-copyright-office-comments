I am unequivocally against the use of AI in the production of creative, journalistic, and scholarly works. As an educator at a post-secondary institution, I have seen how AI is to the detriment of students who, given the opportunity, will forego learning important skills in favor of using AI. Furthermore, as an author of fictional works and a supporter of visual artists, I believe that AI poses a very real and tangible threat to the livelihood of those in creative industries. This has already been made apparent with Disney&#39;s treatment of its employees. I have also spoken to numerous colleagues in publishing who have indicated that their submissions inboxes are teeming with AI-generated works produced by individuals who have not invested any labor in their submission. Individuals have also exploited self-publishing platforms to publish AI-generated content under the names of well-known authors. In response, Amazon, which is popularly used for self-publishing, has had to update its terms of service to control for AI-generated content, as it frequently capitalizes on the name/fame of other well-known creators. Furthermore, large publishers are increasingly cutting out illustrators and artists in favour of AI-generated artwork because it is cheap. This has already been seen with Bloomsbury and its use of AI for the cover art of NY Times bestselling authors like Sarah J. Maas.<br/><br/>In summary, AI poses a serious risk to the integrity of multiple industries that have historically relied on human creativity, skill, and labor. We are already witnessing the impacts of this, and I believe that the US Copyright Office should take a firm stance against AI-generated content by increasing protections for human-generated content and refusing to grant AI-generated content copyright protections. <br/>
