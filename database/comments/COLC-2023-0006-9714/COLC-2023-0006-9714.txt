Hello! As a writer, screenwriter, and active pursuant of independent filmmaking, I believe that AI-generated works should, in most cases, not be eligible for copyright. A vast majority of AI software is trained on written (such as books, film scripts, ect) or visual (artworks, paintings, ect) media without permission and without creator&#39;s knowledge. AI, functionally, recreates patterns it gleans from these works. Asking an AI to generate something based on someone else&#39;s work is not creating original media, and in a lot of ways, it seems like it would be in itself copyright infringement. <br/><br/>I believe that in very specific cases, in which someone programs their own AI and trains it off of their own works (or with explicit permission for others&#39; works). <br/><br/>I believe too that the very recent WGA contact with the AMPTP reflects these beliefs, and is a very strong representation of the current opinion on AI held by the vast majority of professional screenwriters in the country.  In summary, the deal states that AI cannot write or re-write material, as well as cannot be considered source material. AI is not a tool that can truly create original material, and with the number of ways it&#39;s trained using others&#39; works, should have very strong guidelines as to whether or not it could be given copyright. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time!
