to whom it may concern<br/>I&#39;m writing to you regarding my opposition to allowing artificial intelligence generated art softwares to train their algorithms on copyrighted material <br/>by allowing AI software to train on certain artists work it is able to very accurately and consistently generate artworks similar enough to the original artists work as to take away from that artists revenue. <br/>essentially it will allow users to replicate art from specific artists and reducing those artists revenue stream. and while I doubt we&#39;ll hear complaints from Monet and Michelangelo, still living artists depend on the money from their art sales for their livelihoods. itha s already been shown that AI art generators can harm artists and allowing it to continue will simply make it impossible to make a living off of digital art at a time that it was just starting to gain standing as a valuable form of media.<br/><br/>furthermore I do believe that the requirements for &quot;fair use&quot; in transformative works demands actual transformation on the side of the creator in order to count, and since AI generators are only really able to construct the image based on a preset algorithm and a data set no true creation is taking place. or in other words there is no act of creation taking place.<br/><br/>I implore you to revoke AI generated art softwares ability to train their algorithms on copyrighted works. Especially when there are still ways for these companies to continue their businesses and development, by simply paying artists for the right to use their work as a part of their databases.<br/><br/>Thank you
