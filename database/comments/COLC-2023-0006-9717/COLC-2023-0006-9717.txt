I believe that AI inherently violates copyright. At the current level of technology, a machine cannot create, it can only regurgitate what it is told. The biggest problem I believe is that AI does not have morals. An AI also cannot discern between what is legal and what is illegal nor can it tell correct information from misinformation.  AI also cannot take responsibility for their creations. Part of copyright I believe is responsibility. When something is copyrighted, you are saying that you created this item and you are liable for anything that happens due to your creation. An AI cannot do that. Thus, AI should not be able to be copyrighted.
