Hi, first of all thank you for doing this. I am not a US citizen, however I am married to one and my work leads me to use American-based websites constantly, in a way that right now forces me to chose between either being preyed on by AI scavenging my art for training on said websites or losing a huge part of my advertising power by not using them.<br/>I wanted to give my perspective as a classically trained artist now using the internet as their primary workspace to answer a pervasive idea that is promoted by defenders of computer-generated images, that it&#39;s &quot;impossible to define what art is, and actually by denying AI as art you cut out a lot of other art forms as well like collage&quot;.<br/>Photography, collage, readymade and various of the more abstract styles of painting and drawing are all art, and AI isn&#39;t. Why is that ? Simply, there are skills required to make technically interesting artpieces using these media, let alone meaningful ones. A skilled photographer might not be skilled with a pen, but their knowledge of composition and observation will always be transferrable to a new medium, in a way that they&#39;ll never start their art journey from scratch again. Because they&#39;re already an artist, because they&#39;ve already done art and are skilled at it. Speaking for myself it took me a decade to get to a level where I was able to get paid for my work drawing traditionally, and once there it took me less than a year to reach a somewhat similar level switching over to digital. The skills are more comparable than with say collage or sculpture but the core principle still stands: I had gone and learned traditional art in art school, and while there I learned a slew of skills that were not at all limited to one tool, and when it came to switching I did not have to learn these skills again. Because by that point I was already a trained artist. I could just switch to sculpting with clay tomorrow and the biggest challenge would be to find a new market more than any skill issue.<br/>Meanwhile messing about with a computer to generate new pictures randomly has NO transferrable skills whatsoever. So much of the work has been taken out of your hands by a pattern seeking piece of software that it is impossible to learn anything from the experience. It&#39;s just plain to see when before you click the doodad to generate a new picture, you have NO IDEA what it will look like, none whatsoever unless you&#39;ve been iterating on it before. You&#39;re not having an idea, formulating it in your mind and applying your skills to getting it out into the world, you just sort of have an idea and then a machine does the actual art work for you.<br/>The only way one could possibly get better as an artist from doing this is if somehow they were deluded enough to think the process of scalping every artists&#39; work in history was ethical, while also being observant and caring about art history enough that they&#39;d learn critical skills from looking at the result of their quotation mark work end quote.<br/>Which is something they could do by instead going to a museum, or the internet. And if being an art historian isn&#39;t good enough for them, I invite them to actually join the elite exclusive vip club they&#39;re funding the death and automatisation of, by simply picking up a pen and piece of paper and starting to draw.<br/>It is in fact that simple.<br/>Likewise with poetry, which is often compared to prompt writing by people who write prompts and never poetry: it does not include a stage in its process where all your artistic intent is surrendered to a machine to churn out a mash up of unethically sourced content. Nobody is going to buy a small book of computer generated picture prompts to keep on their night stand.<br/>The problem highlighted by these arguments is often that the people promoting &quot;AI art&quot; are often just the mouthpieces of wealthier STEM graduates trying to sell unstable softwares, some already going bankrupt, as a way to destabilize the creative industry and replace the job of many soon to be unionized workers with machines who will not ask for fair wages. It feeds on the resentment of people who have no understanding of art and art history, who think they&#39;ve been kept away from it by some immaterial wall that can&#39;t possibly a lack of time and effort from their part, to try and muddle what is and what isn&#39;t a product worthy of recognition.<br/>And as a result, and even though I&#39;m all the way across the Atlantic, I&#39;d be very grateful and would benefit from it if you&#39;d passed laws restricting the ability to claim copyright to works generated without to use of such softwares, which have nothing to do with digital drawings, or collage, or poetry, or art in general. Thank you for your time.
