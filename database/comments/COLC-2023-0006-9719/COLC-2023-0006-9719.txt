Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment.<br/>I am an artist whose living depends on my being able to monetize my work. I&#39;m a digital illustrator mainly working in the book publishing industry, where we can already see AI&#39;s negative influence. <br/><br/>Firstly and most importantly, when you simplify the concept of AI &quot;art&quot;, it&#39;s nothing more but stolen paintings/images that belong to real people that are then thrown into the AI database and regurgitated back into a new piece of AI &quot;art&quot;. The original artists are not credited nor compensated while their hard work and livelihood is compromised and abused.<br/><br/>Allowing AI &quot;art&quot; to exist as a real alternative to art that is produced by humans would also massively devalue said real human&#39;s work. AI &quot;art&quot; is sold at a fraction of what an original painting produced by a human being would cost,  thus driving prices incredibly low and forcing real artists out of their jobs. This phenomenon is sadly already happening, as AI &quot;art&quot; is currently circulating without any real restrictions.<br/><br/>I am now honestly living in fear at how AI could take over the industry I work in and render me and my skills useless. Artists&#39; work should be protected and supported through all means necessary, art is a livelihood for some of us, yes, but the cultural value of it is infinite.<br/><br/>There is a strong policy to promote art by allowing authors exclusive rights in their creative works during a set period of time.  While a work is under copyright, therefore, it should not be used without the author&rsquo;s consent to train generative AI.  To do so would violate the author&rsquo;s exclusive rights to control their work while copyright applies.<br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.<br/><br/>
