Thank you for opening these important questions up for public comment.<br/><br/>I am a writer and researcher whose living depends in part on my being able to monetize my publishable work. (I am also a musician, and a supporter of authors and artists in general, and recognize that it is important in a democratic society to support the creation of art.)<br/><br/>The Copyright Act places time limits on when an author has exclusive rights in their creative works.  This balances allowing the author to promote their work and recover for their efforts against the public&rsquo;s ability to use the work.  Applying this system to generative AI is fair - generative AI may be trained on materials in the public domain, but it would be a violation of an author&rsquo;s exclusive rights in their works to train generative AI on the author&rsquo;s work while it is under copyright.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office should adopt positions that copyright infringement includes training generative AI on copyrighted works when it is done without the permission of the authors whose works are being used in the training.<br/><br/>Thank you again for your time and consideration of these comments.
