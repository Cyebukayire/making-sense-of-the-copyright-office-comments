Five of my traditionally published books for which I hold the copyright have been used, without my permission, consent, credit, or compensation to generate AI content. None of my work falls under &quot;fair use&quot; and thus my permission must be granted prior to use.  All artists should be compensated for the use of our work. Without it, AI would be extremely limited. With it, these companies that stole our property stand to make billions of dollars without compensating any of the artists whose work they used to create it.
