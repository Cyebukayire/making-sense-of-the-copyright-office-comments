While it is important to setup new laws to adjust for AI&rsquo;s emerging technology, I do believe we need to be careful about not over correcting. AI generated art and writing has opened the doors to these fields from many who haven&rsquo;t traditionally been able to participate, such as the poor, neurodivergent, and disabled. Folks who have been creative in the past, but whose bodies have given out on them or whose minds no longer allow the focus.<br/><br/>We need rules and regulations in place, but not to benefit mega corporations or make yet another billionaire another island getaway, but keep the rights of individual creators who use AI front and center. When a person (not a corporation) crafts art, that person needs to retain it, regardless of the tools used. This should be the same for AI art. Keep the art tied to a human. Keep the writing tied to humans.<br/><br/>Do this, and we&rsquo;ll see a new renaissance of artistic expression. Let the status quo of corporations buying up any and all IP/assets continue, or, worse, leave AI generated works in the public domain so companies can take advantage of these artistic expressions with no recompense or protection, and that dystopian meme about AI generating all content going forward becomes reality.<br/><br/>Protect creators of all types going forward and do what you can help those whose work was used without permission to build these libraries, but don&rsquo;t cut off your nose to spite your face or let greed lean this toward more business profits.<br/><br/>AI generated content has the chance to democratize creativity. Let&rsquo;s make that happen.
