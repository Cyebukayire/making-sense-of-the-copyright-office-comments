Thank you for the opportunity to weigh in on this discussion. I propose that AI as it is currently presented is not truly AI. This is not artificial INTELLIGENCE. These programs are not sentient, they do not present original thought as human beings do. In actuality, they mine actual original ideas created by humans, be it the written word or art or new concepts, meld it together in a plausible-sounding mass, and call it an original idea. This is not intelligence, this is theft. Plagiarism in the digital age served up wrapped in algorithms and data collection to look enough like technological progress so that people will be dazzled by it and the &quot;convenience&quot; it provides. But this convenience comes at the cost of original thought, at the cost of writers and artists and innovators, whose hard work goes uncredited because it is lost in the coagulated, stolen mass that is &quot;AI&quot;. They lose out on credit that rightly belongs to them, and in many cases, their livelihood. Let&#39;s call this &quot;AI&quot; what it is, and what it is not. It is theft, and it is not a replacement for human thought, hard work and innovation. We must place regulations upon it and protect the works done by the artists, writers, and thinkers that are harmed by these programs. Thank you for time, and I hope you consider my opinions on this matter.
