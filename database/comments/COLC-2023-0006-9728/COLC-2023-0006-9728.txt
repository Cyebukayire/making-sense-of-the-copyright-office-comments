Generative AI models have perpetuated the most brazen daylight intellectual property theft of our generation. These machines are trained on billions of stolen works by most living artists without their consent, credit, or compensation. By allowing users to prompt the names of artists, these generators can produce an infinite number of images resembling the work of human artists thereby severely limiting their ability to continue finding gainful employment because they now have to compete with a limitless flow of content generated from their own images. Many of these AI programs charge a monthly fee to their users, and instead of licensing or commissioning art directly from the artists, people and companies use image generators to redirect the already limited income of artists directly into the coffers of tech giants. AI-generated images are already widely used and sold and If tech companies continue to assert their self-proclaimed entitlement over all works by creatives, it will render the concept of copyright and intellectual property meaningless leading to a free-for-all in the creation of new works going forward. This could strip the humanities out of being human.
