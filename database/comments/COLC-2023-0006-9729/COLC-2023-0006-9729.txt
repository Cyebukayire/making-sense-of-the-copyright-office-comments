AI art in its current form is functionally equivalent to a search engine.  The user enters keywords, and the system searches through its collection of millions of other people&#39;s works to create a composite image or text.  In contrast, CGI requires the user to load specific models, which are created or purchased by the user.  A typewriter or word processor requires all input to come from the user.  Granting copyright to the user for the results of AI is no different from granting copyright to the user for the results page of a search on Google, except worse, because at least the search page credits the sources.<br/><br/>A research paper requires reading numerous sources, parsing the information, and organizing it into a new, coherent result in the researcher&#39;s own words.  The AI version skips the human consideration and simply cobbles together the sources, without credit.<br/><br/>Of course, crediting the source requires that the search keep records of which sources are used.  I think it highly unlikely these AI art and text generators have kept records of the billions of works they incorporated into their software, nor do I believe they would cooperate with demands to remove works.  The way they have set up their software makes it impossible to properly link the stolen work for purposes of DMCA notice.<br/><br/>This makes licensing likewise impossible.  Even if visual art and written words were given the same Mandatory Licensing that musical copyright has included for years, which I think should be modified to Per Copy Sold since Per Copy Created is meaningless in a digital world, the AI programs as they currently exist do not appear to have a system in place to even credit the source, let alone track royalties owed.<br/><br/>What&#39;s more, a significant percentage of works scraped by these systems come from ordinary web users who likely have little to no knowledge of copyright law and would likely be unable to afford to bring suit even if they knew how.  What remedy could such people attempt, when they often live paycheck to paycheck (unless they are starving artists who cannot even afford that) and lawyers are tremendously expensive?<br/><br/>On the matter of human likeness, it should be considered the right of an individual to have a say in what is done with that individual&#39;s likeness.  Actors and actresses literally contract their visage in movies and video series - the same right to contract should be held for everyone else.  There is already a disturbing amount of fake porn and fake &quot;photographic evidence&quot; being distributed all over the web.  It&#39;s bad enough to see it with celebrities&#39; images, but what happens when someone with a grudge uses it to get a hated co-worker fired?  To get a rival kicked out of school?  To get an innocent convicted of a murder?  This is a dangerous weapon of slander/libel, and there are far too few safeguards in place.
