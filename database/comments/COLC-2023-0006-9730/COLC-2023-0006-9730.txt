The way these AI Image generation models are trained is by unconsensually  taking images from across the internet, resulting in both private information being accessed and artists having their work used for profit without compensation or consent. Also, AI Image generation has the potential to spread misinformation in any visual form, from showing people in situations they were never in to altering photos to fake evidence. There are serious ethical problems with this technology as a whole.
