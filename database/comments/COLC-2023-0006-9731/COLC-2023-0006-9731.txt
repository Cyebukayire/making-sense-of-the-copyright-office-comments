AI generation is technology that utilizes work made by actual artists without consent. Allowing anyone to profit off the hard work of someone else&rsquo;s hard work and talent should go against any and all copyright laws, not to mention being completely and wholly immoral. <br/><br/>Furthermore we are seeing people use these technologies to spread misinformation with the Israeli/Palestine conflict. Allowing these technologies to continue will prevent people all over the world from being able to tell the truth or not. The beauty of the internet is it allowing people from all over the world to connect and learn. If people are unable to learn without even the fear of what they are seeing being real or faked, where will that lead us?<br/><br/>You need to be our last bastion. Only you can prevent a word where use and our children will be unable to know the truth.
