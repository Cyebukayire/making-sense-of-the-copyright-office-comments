I&#39;m a screenwriter whose entire livelihood could be threatened by unregulated A.I. And it&#39;s not just me -- it&#39;s thousands of screenwriters, novel writers, journalists, and more. We can&#39;t allow thousands of careers to disappear just so a small percentage of people can make even more money. No administration wants to report a high unemployment rate... well, that&#39;s what will happen if A.I is unregulated.<br/><br/>Moreover, A.I text generators are trained on human-made writing. The companies should have to pay EACH AND EVERY writer whose work was used in the training of the A.I.  Authors should be able to sue to remove their material from the algorithm, and if removal is not possible, then that particular A.I generator shouldn&#39;t be legal to use. Using songs in commercials or adapting books into TV shows requires paying the rights holder.  Why should A.I be given a pass? <br/><br/>A.I is not human and should not be able to hold copyright of any material. Those who use A.I text/image generators should not be able to copyright anything with its creation because it is NOT human made. It is an imitation machine built on stolen material. A thief.
