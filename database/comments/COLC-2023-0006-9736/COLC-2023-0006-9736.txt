I believe AI art is the future, and just as painters were afraid of photography, so many artists are afraid of AI. But I do not believe these fears are based in reality. But rather the technology will allow us as artists to go farther and faster than ever before. And art by humans will continue to sell at a premium. AI art must be allowed to continue to innovate. Copyright law should not stand in the way of innovation. And I also believe AI art should be allowed to be copyrighted, because those who train the AI and prompt it are in full control. It only does what humans ask of it, just like a paint brush.
