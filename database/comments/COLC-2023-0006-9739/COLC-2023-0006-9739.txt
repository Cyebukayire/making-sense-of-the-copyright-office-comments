AI is theft. I am an artist and a professor, and when tech companies scrape my website for content without my consent they are stealing from me. If another person did what these companies do with my doctoral dissertation&mdash;feed it into an algorithm without citations to plagiarize my work&mdash;there would be severe consequences. But because the US idolizes tech bros with bad ideas, this is somehow acceptable. They can scrape my website and social media to steal my art to create Franken-art from it without my consent, making people less likely to buy my original work. My students are harmed by this as well&mdash;as the  media recommends chatgpt et al, they learn cheating is better than learning.<br/><br/>But none of this should be legal. My art is mine, and it&rsquo;s availability on the internet is not consent to steal it (to defend that is the rapist&rsquo;s defense &ldquo;she was wearing sexy clothes&rdquo;: my art&rsquo;s appeal does not justify its theft). How are artists to function when their work being stolen is sanctioned by the tech companies we need to post on in order to gain an audience?<br/><br/>If AI is allowed to continue, each and every creator should have to consent BEFORE they feed anything into the algorithm. The consent model needs to be as clear as the GDPR data rules in the EU to prevent sale of personal information by businesses.<br/><br/>Finally, the energy required to create AI is so significant that it would be a net environmental good to ban it entirely. These companies also aspire to taking over healthcare (people have suicided over fake AI chat therapists already), which should be against all medical codes that exist.<br/><br/>AI is deeply dangerous. Tech companies prove again and again they have no scruples when it comes to profiting, and they should be fined at the highest amount for stealing intellectual property. Creating unauthorized AI should be as financially risky as using Disney franchise figures without permission. All artists and creators deserve to be protected, not just big businesses like Disney.
