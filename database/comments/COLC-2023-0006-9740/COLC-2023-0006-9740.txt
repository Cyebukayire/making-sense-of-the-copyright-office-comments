As an artist AI art is absolutely disheartening seeing how little work someone puts into a piece of art, the blatant thievery of other artists work in the system to reference when turning prompts into art, thr lack of effort, and the lessining opportunities for real artist.<br/>You shouldn&#39;t have to worry someone could like your art and simply type your online username into an AI prompter and add whatever else they won&#39;t and replicate art that looks indistinguishable of your style but be not yours, or let alone something you would never draw like extreme NSFW or violence.<br/>Not toentiom how AI image generation can be used to create unethical generation of adult content even of minors
