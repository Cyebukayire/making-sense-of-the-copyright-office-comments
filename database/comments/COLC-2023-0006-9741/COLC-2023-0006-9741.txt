Hello, I am a 40 year old,  20 year veteran of the digital visual artis who works in tech, and I&#39;d like to address this. <br/><br/>I think its important to address the elephant. &#39;Ai&#39; isnt real. <br/><br/>Calling what we&#39;re currently seeing on the market as &quot; ai&quot; is effectively a marketing lie. There&#39;s no intelligence here, there never has been, nor will there ever with these current models. It can not accurately predict future crimes, is questionable as to how it can handle medical information. What you are looking at is a wide spread deployment of exploitation, and laundering of copy-written and personal data through software.  We&#39;ve seen this with OpenAi, StabilityAi, Midjourney, Google, Microsoft and others using copy-written works to produce software that launders imagery, music, personal identifiers, medical data, and much worse to sometimes comical, and other times horrifying results. <br/> <br/>In the art world we&#39;ve seen it with well known entities like Adobe stating that they have the extended right to use adobe stock contributors works for a product that was effectively non existent a year ago and promoting &#39;ai influencers&#39; to push it to the public, one of whom the US Copyright Office had to spend time and energy circling around to rescind the copyright on the imagery they submitted for a comic generated through prompting up actress Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman&#39;s likeness without permission. <br/><br/>It is software, that is designed to find the middle point between fact, and fiction, which , to those of you who quickly realize, is just more fiction. We&#39;ve already seen political parties use it to generate lies about opponents, and it will not be the last. Its being used to generate adult content of celebrities, random strangers, wives friends and the worst of the worst,<br/><br/> https://petapixel.com/2023/02/21/pedophiles-are-using-ai-generators-to-create-child-abuse-images/<br/><br/>It has already crossed the line from things you should be concerned about, to things that should have already dragged so called &#39; ai&#39; developers into court, and has in a few cases. But it should not be up to individual people to have to do this, the government should have the power to litigate, fine, imprison perpetrators and disgorge datasets, immediately.  <br/><br/>The list of questions may be missing the current reality of the situation. <br/>Non-Ai software, marketed as future grade artificial intelligence is being shoved out to replace workers with exploited/ unpaid/ copy-written material and personal data by &#39;ai&#39; hype men admitting they do not care to check if the database or others were correctly labeling copy-written content as open source. Headed by people, if their own statements and coverage would suggest,  no one in their right mind should trust :<br/><br/>https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/06/04/stable-diffusion-emad-mostaque-stability-ai-exaggeration/?sh=27c2b8a675c5<br/><br/>https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2022/09/16/midjourney-founder-david-holz-on-the-impact-of-ai-on-art-imagination-and-the-creative-economy/?sh=1ddc4c022d2b<br/><br/>The likes of these CEO&#39;s are crypto/web3/metaverse conmen, looking to find another grift through silicon valley venture capitalism. <br/><br/>Tech CEO&#39;s are trying to distract from the already existing extortion, for fears of a Terminator apocalypse. Its much more likely these software distributions would destroy lives through commercial means before we ever get our hands on an actual SkyNet. <br/><br/>These are existential problems that just WILL happen if &#39;ai&#39; is continued to abuse the public and private sphere.  Private sector cant be trusted with it, government bodies cant be trusted with it, people, can not be trusted with it. <br/><br/>I must state again, this is not &#39;ai&#39; as major tech giants and the smaller but up and coming &#39;ai&#39; software companies would have you believe. This is a parlor trick built atop data compression and making data searchable but unreliable. Its a machine that strings together words , or images , with a confident output based on parameters and biases and math driving the next word in a chain. If it had any intent, it would be lying, but instead its just incorrect or as programmers state for it &#39;hallucinating details&#39;.<br/><br/>Building new exceptions to a system to address something it is not, is not the direct approach people need , right now we need everyone to take a serious look at how software that effectively regurgitates information, false or otherwise, is being used to upend workers, steal from artists and common people, upend faith in government, and attack the livelihoods of everyone it touches. Address the negligence and profiteering that these companies are performing atop the exploited work of others, the copyright and human rights violations they&#39;ve perpetrated, knowingly, to try to drive up evaluations. <br/><br/>To them, this is just money, to everyone else, it&#39;s our lives.<br/><br/>Thank you.
