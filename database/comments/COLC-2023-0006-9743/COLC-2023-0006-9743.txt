If you park my car in a public place it doesn&#39;t mean someone can take it and use it without my consent and put it back. Its still a personal property.  Now we have AI companies take my artwork and used it in their machine and made a website that making money straight from our artwork in massive scale. That would put many many mid and lower income artists out of job. It&#39;s unnecessary to make this technology work on targeting illustrators, copper right laws should be far more strict for robots that humans. It also deceiving students in all universities and make them not able to follow their artistic future. I think the unnecessary image making will push the world to a point then nothing is real. Then I don&#39;t know what the point of trying to be better. The pyramid marketing scams where promising same things that it&#39;s the future of work no one needs to work hard anymore.<br/>It&#39;s also harmfull to be able to make a fake image of anyone in place that they&#39;ve never been. We know 90% of the use would be to scam High-schoolers and teens and cheating on illustrators and photographers.
