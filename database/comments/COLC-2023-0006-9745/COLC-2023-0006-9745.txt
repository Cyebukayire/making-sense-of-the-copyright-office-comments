Greetings, for the record I&#39;m NOT an American citizen, I&#39;m an European citizen and more over Artist for the Entertainment Industry. I work in the field for several years and I&#39;ve been working for US movies productions and TV production for years.<br/><br/>I&#39;m watching from Europe how the A.I debate is going in the US and I wanted to share my two cents. My work has been stolen and aggregated into modern generative A.I tools dataset. Theses companies didn&#39;t ask me or compensate me, yet they can produce look-a-like images by training specific dataset. I never asked to be part of this and I feel like my privacy has been violated for business purpose. <br/><br/>This just feel super illegal even if not yet defined by the international law. I truly hope that heavy restrictions will be set by the US as an example for the rest of the world. You cant scrap and exploit our work like this.<br/><br/>Last note : if you remove all the professional artists (2015-2020 digital artists) theses dataset will become mostly useless for today&#39;s quality requirements in art jobs. This says a lot imo and theses A.I business just do business on OUR art. Their system SHOULD be opt-in, not opt-off, doing do is already hard for US citizen, as an European I don&#39;t want to have to go through complex international proc&eacute;dures just to get my art removed from their dataset / latent training. It just must be opt-in only.
