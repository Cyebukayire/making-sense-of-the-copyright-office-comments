Hello, I&#39;m a small artist from Colombia. I wanted to share my perspective on how generative AI has been affecting the art/voice actor community and the regulations I would like to implement for the development of this technology.<br/><br/>We cannot deny that this technology is incredibly impressive and opens a lot of opportunities for the creative industry, but the way it has been used so far has just been destructive and concerning. The way the datasets are trained is basically exploitation of the works of millions of artists and also people who upload photos to the internet, and for voice actors, their recorded voices. The lack of regulations on this technology has greatly affected the art/voice actor community. People have trained various AI models on a single person&#39;s art to harass them, photos of real people being used to generate images, some of them being very distasteful, people using voice actors&#39; voices through AI without their permission, using AI voices to scam call people, and a lot of issues if this technology keeps going the way it&#39;s going so far. We need to implement heavy regulations for this type of technology to be able to give it the proper use while also being ethical. This technology is very good to just stop developing it, but that doesn&#39;t mean we have to ignore the people that are affected by it.<br/><br/>The regulations I would like to be given to AI-generated works are just two things:<br/><br/>- It can only use data that the user owns or has permission to use for training.<br/><br/>- It cannot be used commercially in any context, given that it is artificially generated.<br/><br/>When talking about AI images, it has been argued that AI generates new images based on the data being fed to it, being compared to how artists get inspiration for a piece and how artist make pieces based on copyrighted caracters (fanart), but i have to disagree; most AI models work by a system of neural network inspired by how the human brain works, but when it comes to creating art it doesn&#39;t translate completely, when an artist develops their identity they don&#39;t just build up their style by the references they have seen, they stylize components of their art depending on how they feel about it, how they interpretate it, if AI were to imitate humans in the way they make art it would have to be fully sentient. Discussing the fanart point, fanart falls under fair use for all four main factors: Fanart is made to show appreciation and love for an IP, and depending on the owner, it is given permission to sell it, Artists drawing fanart mostly use their own style and interpretation of the subject being drawn, so it is transformative. The amount of original work being used varies, but in general, it is not enough to violate copyright. And as mentioned before, the purpose of fanart is to show appreciation of a certain work to the original owner, thus not harming the market for the original owner. When it comes to AI-generated content, it doesn&#39;t meet all fair use factors. For example, models trained to replicate a specific artist&#39;s work drive away the market that would&#39;ve invested in the artist in the first place by allowing people to generate artwork made to copy the specific artist&#39;s work for free. AI isn&#39;t able to innovate further than the data it has been given, but it is debatable how the transformative use can be judged, seeing how it takes from so many different images.<br/><br/>When talking about AI voice generators, it is extremely immoral how it is used currently. An individual shouldn&#39;t have to copyright their own voice to prevent uses of it without the individual&#39;s permission. For any use of AI voice generators, it should be obligatory to ask for permission from the owner of the voice if it is permitted to put their voice in the generator.<br/><br/>I am in no way a professional artist yet, i&#39;m willing to learn new techniques and tools to reach that goal, but seeing how AI models work in the present, it is extremely hard for me to use them, if these laws are able to be implemented in how AI works, I&#39;m sure creative fields in the future will find ways to use these technologies in a way to help in their workflow in a way that is efficient and ethical.<br/><br/>I hope I&#39;ve made my points understandable, and I&#39;m hoping to have been of help to this study.<br/>
