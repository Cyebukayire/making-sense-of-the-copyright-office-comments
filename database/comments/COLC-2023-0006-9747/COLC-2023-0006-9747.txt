Scraping copyrighted content without consent is theft. Leaning language models (so-called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; though there is nothing intelligent about it) do not learn and create new works, transcending from its learnings. If that were the case, it would no longer need new content to steal, considering it&#39;s already been &quot;trained&quot; on billions of images and other data sets for which it never either asked for consent or paid for.<br/><br/>It is not because people have shared their work online--work that is often the result of years of dedicated studies and research--that everything online is free to consume as a few tech companies wish.<br/><br/>Creativity is a fundamental part of our humanity. If that is killed off in the process of creating some &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; that doesn&#39;t care for human rights (this is no sentient being, after all, no matter what some gurus might spout), nor for the protection of property, then we are in for a bleak future. Just look at what &quot;AI&quot; generates when it&#39;s consuming its own images (particularly unsupervised).<br/><br/>Horror.<br/><br/>The rights of human creators need to be protected from this latest attack on not only their copyrighted property, but also their livelihoods and the future of all Americans. That includes self-protection, as well, through the use of programs such as Glazing and Nightshade (which would not need to be, had the companies built on the sweat and blood of countless people around the world done so by asking for consent first). Besides, these protections are set only on creators&#39; properties, without causing harem or injury to anyone or anything, so long as no one steals them.<br/>
