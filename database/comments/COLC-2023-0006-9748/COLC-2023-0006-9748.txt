Before humanity begins to embrace A.I., we as people for humanities sake need to take bold and daring steps to create regulation that prevents it from stealing content from working and non-working creatives to create results because that is currently where we creatives find ourselves. Our work has been STOLEN and fed into these algorithms without our consent and knowledge for the initial purpose of education and then these algorithms were MONETIZED by the owners of these algorithms so that they could reap the profits of all the stolen content. This is UNACCEPTABLE and a true and clear violation of copyright law which the copyright office must intervene in or copyright law will become meaningless due to this monumental and massive theft of content.
