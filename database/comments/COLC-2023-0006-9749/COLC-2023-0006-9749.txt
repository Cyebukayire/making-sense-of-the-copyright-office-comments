These AI/ML systems are not just a threat to creative and technical jobs, but a threat to personal growth and ownership in general. Whats the point in spending 5-10 years of my life creating or designing something special, something to give me an edge and an identity in the market, if its just going to be hoovered up by these billion dollar tech companies and spat out whole-cloth or &#39;interpolated&#39; in auto-generated work for free to their user-base without any consent or compensation from me?<br/><br/>They say &quot;your code and art doesn&#39;t exist inside the training data! It learns like a person!&quot;<br/>It does not learn like a person. It is not a person. This is self evident in the fact that self driving cars use these same image generative ML systems, and after 20 years of &#39;learning&#39; they still can&#39;t drive properly. It doesn&#39;t take a teenager more than a summer to learn to drive, so clearly these machines are not &#39;learning like people&#39;.<br/>And even if they did, in what world, and by what logic does that make it okay to benefit off the creative/technical labor of others for monetary gain or otherwise?  I can think of no context where taking the blood, sweat, and tears of individual workers and using it against them in the market should be acceptable.<br/><br/>Its simple. Any and all data in any form belongs to the person/entity that created it. If I create data in the form of code or art, its my right, and my right alone how that data is handled or used. If these AI/ML companies want to benefit from my work, my DATA they can pay for it. They can request access or a license on my terms directly. Not though some sneaky &#39;Terms of Service&#39; with absurd working, but DIRECTLY. They do not get to just TAKE IT FROM ME. If i post my artistic work online it still BELONGS TO ME. If I post my code in an online repository it still BELONGS TO ME.<br/><br/>The copyrights should be seen as infringed the moment data is ingested into these systems without explicit informed authorization from the owner of the data. It shouldn&#39;t matter if the data is or isn&#39;t &#39;within&#39; the system afterwords. It was used completely as training material at the moment of ingestion, and they did not get consent.<br/><br/>All of these companies need to have their ill-gotten systems destroyed and then they can start from scratch properly. They can go about this the way they should have from the start, with transparency and respect, and then they can build a proper product with data they have gathered ethically.
