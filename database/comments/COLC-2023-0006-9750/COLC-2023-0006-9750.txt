Useful technology, however its encroachment on identity, art, likeness ownership, creative media fields as a whole has been devoid of morals, ethics, and outright theft. Most of that leaves one with a distrust of anything its involved in. In all honesty it violates more copyrights in its use and adoption of it furthers cheapens and regurgitates whatever it produces for the sake of &quot;Mediocrity can be at the fingertips of the lazy&quot;. So long as you have zero care about the misuse of materials and lack of ethics to the original creator(s) who are often victims of such technology.<br/><br/>It&#39;s use in furthering math, technology, and such fields could be amazing. Just keep it out of Art, Media, and similar fields where Human creativity should be done by Humans, not programs automated by algorithms and code.<br/><br/>It also should never be allowed to reproduce Actors likeness, voice or image without consent from the individual expressing their approval. Tom Hanks being used as an example, should never have his likeness used in a commercial by an ai image &amp; voice of him without approval. It should open any company or person to the same crimes &amp; litigation that other products that are copyrighted. Our likeness shouldn&#39;t be free use for easy profit. There needs to be more protections and limits in regards to our person.<br/><br/>In the end ask yourself how you would feel if your image was used to sell something you oppose of, or your art portfolio was scrubbed so some individual who doesn&#39;t value you can use it to make knockoffs. It needs to be brought in line, its been an ethical nightmare for the past year or so.
