Ai generated images can be a helpful tool if regulations were in place, but right now it&rsquo;s hurting artists. Examples of artists who&rsquo;s style has been stolen are: @feefal_ on twitter, @loishh on twitter, the recently deceased Kim Jung Gi, Greg Rutkowski, and Sam Yang. All of these artists have had their style stolen through AI after they had clearly stated they don&rsquo;t consent for their art to be used in ai datasets. They are also cyber-bullied by the same people making &ldquo;ai art&rdquo; based off their style. Master, Kim Jung Gi&#39;s art was fed into an Al model a day after he died (w/o consent and against the wishes of his family). @loish sells three different art books that include her art, studies, tips for artists, and practices for learning art. The models based off her style are directly taking away from sales of her book. People would rather type a sentence into an AI generator instead of paying an artist and working to learn their style which hurts her business.<br/>When people sell &ldquo;AI art&rdquo; they are unfairly competing with artists making commissions. I&rsquo;ve also attached images of the money one of these AI artists makes along with some of the creepy prompts he is asked to make. People have asked him to generate porn of their coworkers (and I doubt the coworker is aware of this which is a whole different legal issue), rape images of their wife, along with other very concerning themes. He makes thousands of dollars off the back of real artists&rsquo; works (and none of this money goes to the artists whose art was used in the data sets). <br/>The last three images are screenshots showing how Sam, Greg and @feef_ have had their art stolen and used in ai datasets. You can generate images in any of their styles. This is directly taking money from these artists, because people can make a picture in their style using AI rather than commissioning a work from these artists. <br/>Attached files: <br/><br/>IMG_0602 shows the books @loishh sells that can teach the reader her style, story, and tips for being a better artist. <br/><br/>IMG_0606 shows how much one &ldquo;AI artist&rdquo; makes using their AI generated images. <br/>IMG_0607 and IMG_0608 show examples of images this person has been asked to create. These are images people would be purchasing from him. Consent from the artists and subject matter have not been given for these images. <br/><br/>IMG_0613 shows @feefal_ asking someone to take down the AI model replicating her style. She reminds them that her stance against AI has been very clear and she does not consent to her art being used in AI datasets. <br/>IMG_0588 shows the multiple different AI models replicating Sam&rsquo;s style<br/>IMG_0590 shows Greg&rsquo;s style can be replicated using ai<br/><br/>I am happy to provide more images if you need further context for any of these examples. And if you have questions, or anything was unclear, I am happy to answer them. Thank you for taking the time to read this, my goal was to share a real life examples of how artists that have already lost money/commissions due to AI images trained on their art. This will only become a bigger issue in the future and AI needs to be regulated.
