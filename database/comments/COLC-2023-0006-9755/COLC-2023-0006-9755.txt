While AI may provide great possibilities, in art it is simply not acceptable in its current state.  Millions of artists all over the world are victims to all AI image scrapers who not only steal, but make profit off their work.  An artist&#39;s hard work and passion is violated by this tool.  It should not be copyrightable and should be illegal.  Why should someone who blatantly steals work using word inputs, especially an artist&#39;s name, be able to profit from this?  They should be asking permissions and paying those artists whose work they stole.  This not only goes for artists, but musicians, writers, etc.  Human rights should be protected against AI.
