I firmly believe that Generative Artificial Intelligence&#39;s use of publicly posted intellectual property (artwork, video, audio, etc) without receiving consent from the creators of such works is a violation of those creators&#39; respective copyrights for their works, beyond simply being blatantly immoral.<br/><br/>furthermore, I believe the output of any Generative Artificial Intelligence to be uncopyrightable, due to being the aggregate product of hundreds of thousands to millions of individual data sources, as well as having no human creator.
