aI image generation has sucked the life out of art. More AI images have now been made than in the entire history of humanity before it. Art used to be something human and something brilliant, and now it has been automated and dehumanised, every artist I know has fallen into a depressed state. This illegal software is backed by such a huge amount of money that it seems untouchable. Please listen to the humans in this situation, and think about of you entire worth was stripped from you by a tech company and the last 20 years of your life were for nothing?
