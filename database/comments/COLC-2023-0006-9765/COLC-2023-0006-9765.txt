The current AI is unethical theft. I as an artist have hundreds of arts online, all now scrapped without my consent. Taking something from someone is illegal, it&#39;s a crime. Why is this not? Cause people have not seen the endless hours we have put into our work. Art doesn&#39;t happen at the push of a button and it shouldn&#39;t. Ai images, not just art, can cause normal people harm, damage that won&#39;t be restored by releasing images that file someone&#39;s reputation. What if some pervert has a crush on your spouse and generates questionable images? Perhaps shares them? Or about yourself? From what I have heard people are already doing foul images of children. Ai needs regulation NOW.  Humanity needs to be kept. When done right ai could be an amazing asset but it needs to be founded on ethical image sources. Not hoarding it all without laws.
