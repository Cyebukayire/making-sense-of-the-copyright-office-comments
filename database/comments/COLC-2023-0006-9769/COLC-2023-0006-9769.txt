Allow media created by an AI process to be copyrighted by the human creator as long as the human played a substantial role in the process. Where AI image generation is concerned for example the human artist provides the prompt, edits the image repeatedly to get a look they desire, may create and discard tens or hundreds of images and spend hours of even days of time to get one image. This combination of human and machine effort to create should be copyrighted assuming other aspects of copyright law apply.  The idea that because the machine does the work of &lsquo;drawing or painting&rsquo; that the human is not involved is inherently flawed. Machines do *most* of the work of humans.  All digital art would be at risk, all computer animation, you could even extend that argument to anything done by a machine in manufacturing! It is still done by a human&rsquo;s control, under human direction. The computer isn&rsquo;t just spitting out art because it&rsquo;s feeling creative. A human has to have an idea, sit down with the tool, feed it the information, and see it through to completion. The fact that the tool has changed doesn&rsquo;t make this any different. The fact that the tool has made parts of the process substantially easier also doesn&rsquo;t change this. If the AI were capable of just spitting out art, all on its own, no prompt, no human activity needed, just sitting there of its own violation creating art.. we&rsquo;d be having a different discussion.
