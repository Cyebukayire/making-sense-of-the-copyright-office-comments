It&#39;s quite bad for artists<br/>Most clients have turned to Ai since there&#39;s no costs involved and while it steals from artists, we run out of jobs.<br/>Talking from personal experience, I used to make 3-4 commissions a week. Since Ai has become more popularized, I have received none.<br/>It&#39;s disheartening and promotes low effort and even none from anyone learning art. Just type away words and a machine copies and pastes a collages from artists works...<br/>Not only this but can anyone trust anymore the works at schools and colleges anymore to be from the actual students? How many will graduate and get diplomas whilst having all work done by a machine?
