Generative AI is a harmful to the art community and industry. Anything that utilizes generative AI in any capacity should not be eligible to be copywritten as it uses resources from other artists without thanks, credit, or a share in profits. Furthermore, tools like Glaze and Nightshade are beneficial to help reveal this harmful practice when utilized as well as ensure that their harmful methods are appropriately punished by poisoning the datasets. No real human work goes into the actual creative process of generative AI and thus they should not be eligible to have any generated content protected by law.
