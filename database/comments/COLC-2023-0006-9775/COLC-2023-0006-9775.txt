Generative AI is exploitative by nature in its many current iterations. It is trained on source materials that have not been made available for the purpose, and seeks to devalue the work of real humans by churning out low quality content that vaguely resembles something competently created by a human. If not properly handled, it has the propensity to create negative effects on not just our economy but human creativity at its core.
