Artificial Intelligence, if left to its devices will ravage any and all human-made products only to repackage them and profit off the backs of the original creators. The technology itself won&#39;t be going anywhere. However, legislation should act quickly to catch up to how swift the technology is evolving, to keep the monetary damage done to human creators at a minimum. Artificial Intelligence should be subject to a set of ethical rules and regulations that optimise its convenience while not trampling over the copyright of human creatives. Proper representation for said creatives should be included in the conversation as the regulations are being passed.
