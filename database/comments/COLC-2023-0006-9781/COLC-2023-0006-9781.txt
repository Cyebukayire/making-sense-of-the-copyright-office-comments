The only reasonable option, in my opinion, is to consider image generators as another tool of artistic expression. A tool, yes, a powerful one, but still just a tool. This will allow existing copyrights to be applied to works created using them - which are completely sufficient. Artists using the new tool, as in the case of other artistic techniques, are fully responsible for the results obtained (including any infringements, plagiarism, dissemination of content prohibited by law, etc.).<br/>And that&#39;s it, creators don&#39;t need new regulations.<br/><br/>And who needs them? Large studios and corporations that have already noticed the huge market potential in using closed data sets, creating closed (and of course paid) AI models, as well as providing legal protection for artistic styles. This will inexorably lead to the monopolization of large areas of creativity and will strengthen the great ones even more. Will independent artists benefit from this? I don&#39;t think so. Obviously, AI created on the basis of open software and open tools, giving independent creators greater opportunities, will fall victim to the greed of the big people.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the proposals included in the draft agreement ending the screenwriters&#39; strike shows the way - the studio cannot replace the artist with an AI generator, but the artist can, if he or she wants, use such a tool while working for the studio.
