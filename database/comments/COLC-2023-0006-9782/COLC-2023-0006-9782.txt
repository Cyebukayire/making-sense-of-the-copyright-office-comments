The article in Bloomberg describing tech firms use of copyright text law, which can be found at this link https://apple.news/A0uVSopNhSK2JsHamk1NCzw shows the indifference of tech firms to AI risks. The tech trade group representing Apple, Google, Meta et al are also asking the copyright office to make a mockery of copyright law. To say that it has an exception because of the transformative nature of what AI does with the material is to anthropomorphize what a machine does - which is exactly why AI presents such a long term risk. They are implicitly stating that AI will compete with humans when fully developed. That&#39;s a position that is completely at odds with other statements that it&#39;s analogous to a camera taking photos. A camera doesn&#39;t &quot;learn&quot;.<br/><br/>The fact that they have spent tens of billions of dollars on development just emphasizes the runaway nature of AI heretofore, and in no way justifies throwing more money at its unregulated development in the future. All they are saying is that they got in before there was a realization of the high risks of AI.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The fact that other countries would not have the same constraints on AI development underlines the fact that this is, indeed, a worldwide problem. The U.S. is the furthest ahead, and as such, bears a moral responsibility for leading the world to a more responsible and sustainable AI future.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Robert Riley, Ambassador (ret.)<br/>
