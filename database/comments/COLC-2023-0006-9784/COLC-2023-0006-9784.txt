The concept of AI, while in it of itself can be of benefit to many people, is exploitive to artists and serves to strip art of it&#39;s very meaning: human expression. Left to it&#39;s own devices without any aid in stopping big companies in lobbying against restrictions-such as that of Disney and Dreamworks-many artists stand to loose their livelihoods and years of masterclass training to a software inputted in with their own works (which many did not consent to). It&#39;s evil and demands for more protection to be given to individual artists.
