As an artist, AI has no right to scrape the hard work of artists around the world. It is theft. If someone baked a cake and you took it and called it your own is that fair? No it&#39;s not. And that&#39;s exactly what ai scraping is. Almost no one consented to their art to be thrown into the ai database. That is not right. Art includes not only drawn art but writing, singing, anything creative. And yet by ai creativity is being stolen from us. Jobs are being taken from us. Using our hard work without pay or compensation. Ai is theft.
