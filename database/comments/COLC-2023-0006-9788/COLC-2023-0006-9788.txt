Hello, I am hoping you all can become as stringent as possible to give artists protections against AI image creators. Please don&#39;t give them any lee way, as they purposefully steal people&#39;s art and make AI models with it, when the artist specifically tells them not too. This technology is dangerous and will be used to spread false information. It is already used to create fake porn of people who do not consent to this at all. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll probably do this to children too, if they haven&#39;t already. We need as many protections against these AI users (and the corporations that created the tech) as possible. They have opened Pandora&#39;s box and will not stop, unless they are legally made to.
