I believe the government should mandate an extremely high standard for whether you can copyright AI generated art or text. In most cases, I believe AI generated work should not qualify for copyright at all, unless it has been significantly enhanced and/or altered by a human creator, with the copyright pursuer subject to a high standard of proof that their work is original and distinct from the underlying AI generated work.  Even more crucially, TRAINING an AI on a writer&#39;s (or artist&#39;s or actor&#39;s or musician&#39;s) work should be prohibited without full consultation, meaningful consent, and generous compensation via a negotiated, fully informed OPT IN license with the writer/artist themselves.  In the case of works made for hire, the training right should be retained by the original author, not the entity who holds the copyright, since it is their original work that can be subsequently used (and diminish their value as creators), whereas the copyright holder could continue to exploit their work for financial gain without any compensation going to the artist who generated the original material in the first place.  Please do the right thing and create significant guardrails to prevent AI from replacing human creators, and devaluing the work of those creators.
