I am a new artist. 1 year self employed. I have made 100$ total. Learning artists make money by taking the cheaper options of work, and skill. You have to now be an established professional in the filed to make even a 15$ commission. The skills gap in art is higher crushing the dreams of those who are trying. And when we are finally good enough to make money. Our art and skill will be stolen to line a companies pocket.
