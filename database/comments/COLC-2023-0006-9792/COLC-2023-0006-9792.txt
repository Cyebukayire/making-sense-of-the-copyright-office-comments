AI gets its information by plagiarizing copyrighted work. It scraps the internet for images and mashes them together to create something that is not new but a collage of copyrighted images without crediting the original artist. I do not belive AI should be able to hold a copyright until it can create something original without scraping the internet and being &quot;fed&quot; images.
