(Generative) AI isn&#39;t under copyright yet will destroy copyright. AI works aren&#39;t copyrightable yet will prove irresistable for publishers becuase they cost very little to make. And legal &quot;copies&quot; of copyrighted works can be made through AI - making infringment a thing of the past. In short, copyright will vanish for most works with attendant loss of revenue from copyright IP, loss of copyrighted assets and loss of jobs from AI production. Oddly, there is nothing the Copyright Office can do about it becuase AI works fall outside copyright law.
