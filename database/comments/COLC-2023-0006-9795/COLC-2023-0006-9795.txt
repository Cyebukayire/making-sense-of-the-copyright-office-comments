As a hairstylist in the film/tv industry, I am deeply concerned for the future of my ability to make a living. The entire 100 year old film industry business model is in jeopardy of complete collapse if the studios are able to implement their plans for AI. These plans, first and foremost, intend to eliminate the human element from filmmaking as much as possible to reduce production costs to a minimum and to maximize C-suite and investor profits. If they succeed, hundreds of thousands of industry workers across the world, including myself, will be left without a profession. The legacy of our illustrious industry will be reduced to what can be created by a computer. Right now, SAG-AFTRA (actors union) is in an existential union negotiation against the AMPTP (studios alliance) for AI protections against having their images scanned and stolen for AI use in perpetuity without permission and with no compensation. This is where copyright law must come in to protect us. If there are no real actors, there is no real hair for me to style. More broadly, if AI is trained on the images of my and thousands of other artists work, we are all being stolen from with no consent or pay.  The entire vocation of visual artists of all ilks will be destroyed, as humans simply cannot compete with the speed and financial economy of machine learning and output. Copyright protection is paramount to the future of every creative pursuit in the world. If limits to this technology are not implemented now, the future is truly dystopian.  Let&rsquo;s just call AI what it actually is, which is plagiarism software. It does not create or innovate anything, it just steals from the work and heart of human beings. It&rsquo;s misuse is the literal craftsmanship of our own demise. Please protect us.
