Humans have taken inspiration from other humans artwork in all times. Stable Diffusion (AI creating images) learns from all images it is trained on, but can not reproduce exact artwork - it produces a mix of what it has learned, guided by the human prompt. No Copyright should block the development of Artificial Intelligence. Besides - hindering development of AI in the US will only create a gap between the US and China - where development of AI is MUCH faster.
