Ai art programs unfairly use artist&rsquo;s work while giving nothing back. These programs are another example of tech finding an industry to exploit and making it worse with their tech. Finding new ways to skirt labor laws and &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; people. We need to not repeat the mistakes with the past like with Uber or air bnb and make sure these ai companies from the get go compensate artists correctly and that the right regulations are in place.
