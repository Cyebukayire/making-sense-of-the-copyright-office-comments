Subject: Advancing National Progress through Balanced AI Regulations<br/><br/>Dear US Copyright Office,<br/><br/>I am reaching out on behalf of Raven Rock Cybertechnique Design Bureau, a dedicated player in the field of artificial intelligence. We believe in constructive dialogue and understand the critical role agencies like yours play in shaping our nation&#39;s future.<br/><br/>The transformative power of AI is undeniable. At Raven Rock, our commitment to AI is not just technological but also stems from a vision where the United States remains at the forefront of global innovation. Especially now, as the horizon of Q2 2024 looms with its anticipated economic challenges, leading in AI is not just an aspiration &ndash; it&#39;s a necessity.<br/><br/>History is replete with examples of nations achieving greatness by embracing technological revolutions. Today, as we race against global competitors, leveraging AI becomes paramount. It&#39;s not just about economic growth but upholding our reputation as global pioneers.<br/><br/>We respect the intent behind regulations, grounded in ensuring safety and ethics. Yet, balance is the key. An overly strict framework risks sidelining our nation, making cutting-edge AI the privilege of a few. This isn&#39;t just about businesses; it&#39;s about everyday Americans who stand to benefit from AI-driven solutions in healthcare, education, and more.<br/><br/>The decision before us is crucial: Do we pave the way for inclusive AI-driven growth, or do we risk a future where only a select few benefit? We humbly urge you to consider a balanced approach, one that fosters innovation while upholding our shared values.<br/><br/>Your dedication to this matter impacts not just industries, but the very fabric of our nation. We appreciate your time and commitment.<br/><br/>Warm regards,<br/><br/>Raven Rock Cybertechnique OKB<br/>
