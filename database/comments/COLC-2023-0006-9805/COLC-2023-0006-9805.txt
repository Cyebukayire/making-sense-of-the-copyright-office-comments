Opening public comments in this way serves as a catalyst for people to &#39;rally&#39;, which mostly affects the people who are emotionally invested, or in other words, the people who are against the technological progress and their audiences. This means that you will likely receive a large volume of misinformed comments full of negativity. People on the anti-intelligence side rally and mob downvote anything they think might involve AI, but normal people do not rally mob upvote in contrast to that. <br/><br/>Anyway, people should openly embrace the use of AI, because that is the only way to create a culture where people are honest about the use of it. The choice is between having people honestly admit to the use of AI without penalties or overhead, or to have them dishonestly claim that AI was not used even when it was. Steam is about to learn this lesson the hard way, as more and more developers begin to mask their use of AI to avoid witch-hunting, and more and more of valve&#39;s efforts must be committed to detecting where and when AI was used in a never ending uphill battle they could never possibly win. Governments could just as easily put themselves into a similar position, but again, it&#39;s a fight that you&#39;ll never actually win, so the only path forward is to embrace technological progress and attempt creating a culture where people can openly admit to using AI without being overtly penalized for their honesty. <br/><br/>Within the current culture, if I use 10000 AI generated images inside of a project such as a videogame for various icons/backgrounds, there are incentives in place to abstain from mentioning the use of AI. Any and all penalties or friction derived from the use of AI adds to that incentive to be dishonest. I will not kneecap myself and tie my hands behind my back just to appease people that don&#39;t understand the technology, and many other people feel the exact same way. It&#39;s bad enough to have an angry mob of artists that are so aggressively confused they routinely attack each other, but to have the platforms and government join the anti-intelligence side would create a world where deception is the default in record time. <br/><br/>It might be prudent to have a kind of &quot;within reason&quot; approach, such that someone mass-generating 9999999 images cannot weaponize copyright based on them, and it might not be within reason for someone to outright impersonate an artist or to try selling art under their name, but the vast majority of possibilities are valid and the capabilities are growing daily, so the idea that people are going to stop using these tools just as they&#39;re starting to get the hang of using them is blatantly absurd. We are all just getting started here, and there&#39;s a storm coming, you know?
