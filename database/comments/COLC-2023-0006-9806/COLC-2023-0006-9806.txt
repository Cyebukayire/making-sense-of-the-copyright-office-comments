The idea that AI artwork is not eligible for copyright because &quot;no [human effort] was involved in it&#39;s creation&quot; is an outright fabrication and a gross misrepresentation of the truth. The general public lacks the knowledge of what precisely CAN go into it&#39;s creation. I do not fault the many who&#39;ve only seen works created with DALLE (the model behind Bing&#39;s image generator) and the like presuming all AI work is &quot;as simple as typing words into a box and pressing a button&quot; - but, again, this is false (should you not be allowed to copyright simple crayon drawings because they lack &quot;real&quot; effort?). One can take a look at programs like AUTO or ComfyUI and see it&#39;s much more than just typing words - a plethora of additional parameters can be specified by the user: model, LORAs, hypernetworks, even the resolution play a role into the &quot;look&quot; and content of an image. All of these things, and more, are indicative of a preference from the user and constitute &quot;human touch&quot;. As others have stated, image generation has become a highly specialized skill - it has grown past being as simple as &quot;typing words into a box&quot;, it&#39;s been that way for awhile and will only continue to become more specialized as time goes on. <br/><br/>In terms of copyright, our current laws from my understanding are sufficient in protecting intellectual property, even with the invention of image synthesis; i.e. person(s) cannot profit from copyrighted content without the consent of the copyright holder. The law DOES NOT imply one cannot use copyrighted material as a reference for other works. Why are we attacking the tool (&quot;thing&quot;, &quot;computer&quot;, whatever you want to call it) that MIGHT lead to copyright infringement? One has the same ability to create and sell images of Mickey Mouse or Spongebob with AI as they do with pen and paper - should we create restrictive access to ANY tool with the ability to create copyrighted content? I don&#39;t like the idea of companies scraping the web for data to use in their products, but it is simply NOT copyright infringement as we know it today. <br/><br/>Many claim works created with AI are &quot;derivative&quot; but fail to understand exactly HOW generated images come into being. Look at the recent lawsuit against StabilityAI: The artists claim StableDiffusion &quot;contains compressed images of copyrighted work&quot;. This, again, speaks to the publics lack of knowledge surrounding generated images and specifically the models used in their creation. The model itself is merely code, weights used to create the final image - yes these weights were trained on potentially copyrighted images, but the fundamental idea is the same as how we humans study art and is factually and categorically NOT copyright infringement. <br/><br/>It&#39;s obvious that some form of legislation is needed to quell fears of &quot;losing artistic integrity&quot; - whatever that means, but the fact remains that using copyrighted images to create an image synthesis model is not copyright infringement. One should point out specific people who&#39;ve created works that include copyrighted imagery and go after them, not the tool they used to create it. <br/><br/>Stating &quot;AI images cannot be copyrighted&quot; is equal to stating &quot;Blender (or any 3D modeling software) renders cannot be copyrighted&quot; - or even further &quot;Pencil drawings cannot be copyrighted&quot;.
