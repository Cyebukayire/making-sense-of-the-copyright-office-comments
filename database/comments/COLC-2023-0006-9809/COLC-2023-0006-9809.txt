Nothing should replace humans. Robots don&#39;t have children to feed, put through college, buy cars, health insurance, homes, medical bills, car insurance, groceries, maintenance of vehicles, all the stuff humans have to spend at least $70,000-$110,000 a year just to survive. Don&#39;t you dare replace humans, trades, crafts, jobs, industries, arts with humans.
