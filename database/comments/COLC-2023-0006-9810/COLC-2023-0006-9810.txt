Patrick Mark Burnham<br/>Professional actor name MARK BURNHAM<br/><br/>You have requested comments and concerns regarding the use of &lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; pertaining to copyright issues.<br/>I am a professional actor. I&rsquo;ve spent the last 30+ years I this endeavor. My work involves interpreting the written word, bringing those words into artistic life using my body &amp; voice, in all its possible capabilities. My body is the instrument used in this creation, my mind the creator.<br/>If you permit any computer code or program, to amalgamate this creation process, you effectively remove my individuality and freedom of choice from this process. I would no longer have the freedom to decide which works of art I involve myself in. My digital image( which is the instrument of which I speak above) could be manipulated and manufactured into any type of project, used for any designs or agenda without my choice of consideration. <br/>I can&rsquo;t put it more blatantly than that.<br/>My choice is freedom. My choice is that expression in which I choose to make my statement on the theme of the work in which I involve myself.<br/>The so called Artificial Intelligence available now is neither artificial or intelligence but rather a scraping of data on the internet, effectively gathering already created works, grouping them together into related parameters, and regurgitating them into an homogenized amalgamation of the common aspects or subjects. But it is derived from works already done by other creators. <br/>It doesn&rsquo;t create anything but a plagiarized Frankenstein version around desired parameters.<br/><br/>This process should not be granted copyright by any entity, whether private individual or corporate. <br/>Such works that are created should stringently required to be identified by regular watermark stated to be such a plagiaerized amalgamation merely grouped together for this presentation.<br/><br/>I thank you for this opportunity to comment in this important matter.<br/>Your decision will affect my livelihood and career.<br/><br/>
