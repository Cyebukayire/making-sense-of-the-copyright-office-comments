I&rsquo;m a 23 year old artist who&rsquo;s worked for many major record labels, companies, and many other commercial organizations and I am fully against generative ai models that are trained off of stolen data. It feels like these tech companies have turned us into data pigs being raised only for our data and left to die as soon as they&rsquo;ve exhausted us of all our creative work so they can just steal it and profit off of our many decades and thousands of dollars to get to the level of artist I am today.
