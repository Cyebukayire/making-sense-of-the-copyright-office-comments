Generative AI or AI generated images are purely unethical, scraping copyrighted material from all over the internet from many unsuspecting artists without their consent. This direct theft and violation of the artist&#39;s is horribly affecting the industry; It&#39;s easy to see how many even large corporations are getting away with using artists&#39; stolen work under this guise of &quot;generative&quot; AI. Even I; a small artist with less than fifty followers on my largest platform; have found my own work stolen and put into these databases. Artists of all sizes of followings are being exploited; which is cruel and unfair. It doesn&#39;t even solely affect digital 2d artists, traditional artists are having their work scrapped; 3d artists as well. These generative AI&#39;s even have heavily protected content such as Disney&#39;s or Pixar&#39;s work within them. As an artist and someone relatively familiar with this form of AI model; nothing new is being created. It truly is just a Frankenstein of artist&#39;s copyrighted work being generated within each image. The insistence that the AI has &quot;learned&quot; and created it&#39;s own methods is simply untrue; The AI does not generate new composition, the AI does not generate a under-sketch, a study from a reference, a cleanup sketch, lines, or flat colors; It simply creates a stolen mess. Generative AI as it stands now only benefits from stealing work. Artists have had to form their own means of protection against AI; programs such as Glaze and Nightshade have been saving graces for artists. Glaze being used to distort an image just enough the AI cannot learn from it, whereas Nightshade is being used to &#39;poison&#39; the AI, in which if an AI model is given a &quot;nightshaded&quot; artwork in its dataset, it will effectively completely break and only create cloudy, broken images. Both of these processes are sadly directly destructive to the original artwork as well; effectively forcing artists to censor our own work instead of being able to share it in it&#39;s raw form, even if such changes are &#39;minute&#39;, they shouldn&#39;t have to happen at all. Those who use and profit off of generative AI have been direct about destroying artist&#39;s careers as well; I have seen it everywhere on social media. With the Nightshade project I saw many artist&#39;s lives being directly threatened for using it to protect their work, as well as those who use generative AI actively fighting to find ways to bypass these measures to still scrape the artwork to feed into their machines. Just because artwork is posted to the internet; does not give these people the right to do such a thing. Not to mention the fact that artwork made by young artists, children, is being scraped and put into these AI. AI are being build off of pornographic material and specific artist&#39;s work, which can greatly damage these artist&#39;s reputation, especially as the general public does not have a keen enough eye to tell what is real and what isn&#39;t. Many blossoming artists are accused of producing AI artwork, effectively ending their careers early; and if generative AI were a positive for our community would such &quot;consequences&quot; be a thing?
