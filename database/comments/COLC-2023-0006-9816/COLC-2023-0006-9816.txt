It is not an infringement of copyright law when a human imitates a another artists style. The same should apply to generative AI models.<br/><br/>Artificial intelligence learns in a way that resembles human learning. In a properly trained system, none of the training data is actually present within the model itself, rather the model contains only neural networks that recreate the patterns found within the training data. Since no copyrighted material is being redistributed, it is not even a question of fair use, as styles and patterns do not fall under copyright law.<br/><br/>Material produced by so called &quot;unconditional&quot; image generation models is produced entirely without input of a human. I believe that the output of such models should either be public domain, or owned by the creator of the model. The argument goes two ways: the creator of the model curated the dataset in some way, as such the output is a result of the creators artistic vision when curating the model. Or, the model is producing imagery without the input of a human, as such it is public domain, just as an animals art might be. This issue becomes especially important when considering models with very little curation of their training data.<br/><br/>As for the question of who is responsible for copyrighted generations, it would be the person distributing copyrighted material. It is not a crime to reproduce copyright content in your own home. Some blame may also fall on the model creator, if the ability to create copyrighted generations was due to poor curation of the training data and/or a deliberate attempt to create a model which produces copyright material.
