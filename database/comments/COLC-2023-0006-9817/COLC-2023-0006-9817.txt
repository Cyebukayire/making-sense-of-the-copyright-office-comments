AI generated &ldquo;art&rdquo; should not be able to be copyrighted. Why? Because the current models are based off of STOLEN data. No models have permission nor have given any royalties to the original artist. There are million dollar companies building their foundation off of millions of people&rsquo;s creative works. They should not be allowed to benefit unless they ask for permission.
