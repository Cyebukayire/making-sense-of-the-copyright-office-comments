Generative AI does not help but rather harms the works of many artists, visual or not. It results in impersonation through voice and theft of intellectual property just to generate images and voiceovers. Many current generative AI also use datasets of artist&#39;s works against their permission, alive or not. It goes against their rights to have their livelihoods stolen while being told to adapt or die, hence protection like Glaze or Nightshade is highly necessary. It is an adaptation to theft, after all, yet stirs backlash for no reason  amongst users of generative AI, which shows enough that what they want is not to enjoy making art but to make use of other for personal benefits.
