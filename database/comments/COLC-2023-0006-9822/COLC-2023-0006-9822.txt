 Artificial intelligence in works of art has been tremendously do more harm than good to the people expecially those who worked in the art and entertainment industry. not only it has took many people&#39;s jobs and the fact that it really can only be made as good as it is now with hundred millions of works being stolen without consent, but it also will demolish people&#39;s drive for creativity. AI in arts is a very complex problem but with one simple solution that for some reason not many people thought about. Its existence simply should not exist in the entertainment industry as people&#39;s work can be stolen at anytime without any consent being made. All of what i mentioned above has already happening. The harms has and are being done. Artists now have to work ourselves to prevent and shutdown the ai by making anti-ai application like Glaze and Nightshade. However these are not a long-tem solution because it doesnt take down the very thing that keeps artists doing these resistance. Any people using work of art should not ever make a product without the artist&#39;s consent and compensation. Everything made by someone the moment an ink meets the paper is copyrighted by that specific someone. As an office of copyright you should protect us, inventors, artist, designers, programmers, animators, VFX maker, from any minds that steals our work without our consent. For example, Openai, stabilityai, and midjourney. All of them are one of the few that has stolen our works and i think i can speak for all artists that got their work stolen that we want them to be punished and compensate us for the unconsented profit that they earn by using our product. We artists never wanted this. But they did so without ever asking our consent. Those machine wont be made without our works. it is impossible without us. And they gain profit while we gain NOTHING. Shutdown the ai companies that uses datasets that has art work in it and the datasets compiler like LAION.
