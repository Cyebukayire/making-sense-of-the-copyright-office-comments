AI is life changing. As a director and art director in animation, having worked for Disney, Netflix, and other major animation studios, AI is a tool that lightspeeds my creation process into the vision and thought into reality. Many fear AI not understanding how it works and not having used it at all. Without the prompts I give, the artworks generated would not exist. It is like a computer where I can create with. I am the author and the AI assistant to help me to create. It shares the power of artistry and copywriting to fuel what&#39;s possible.
