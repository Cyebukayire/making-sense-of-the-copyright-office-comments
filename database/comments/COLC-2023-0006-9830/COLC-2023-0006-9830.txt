Artificial intelligence (AI) as we use it today in applications such as Midjourney and other programs is a tool that must be more carefully monitored and moderated. Aggregating and combining extant information into responses to user queries will only output information that is as good as its source, but if those sources are not tracked or credited it becomes impossible for the user to verify the collected information&#39;s accuracy. Artists, writers, actors and all content creators deserve protection from having their works used by AI engines without credit or recompense. AI is not a replacement for human effort, problem solving, or logic.
