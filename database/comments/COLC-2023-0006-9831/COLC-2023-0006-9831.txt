This technology is dependent upon artist&rsquo;s work- their styles they have uniquely developed over decades worth of labor. It specifically uses thes artists&rsquo; styles, remixes it for its consumer, and gives no credit or royalties, and compounded by this plagiarism in practice it double- hurts the professional artist by presenting a falsely legal alternative in the marketplace for the artists it has stolen from.
