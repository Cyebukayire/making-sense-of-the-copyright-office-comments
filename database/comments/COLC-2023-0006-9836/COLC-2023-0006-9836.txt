AI as we have seen it used so far is extremely exploitative. It is trained on work produced by artists and writers who go uncompensated, often without their consent. Art is not just data, and it is not for the taking. AI creators should need express permission to use your content, and this consent cannot be attained on unfair terms. For example, a site should never be able to compel you to give them the right to train models using your content in order to access their services. This consent cannot be bundled into existing terms of service, and compensation for works used should be a legal requirement.
