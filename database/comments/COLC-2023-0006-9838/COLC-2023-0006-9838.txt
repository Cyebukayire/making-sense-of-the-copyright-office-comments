All generative artificial intelligence products as they exist today are built off of human labor - the majority of it non-consensually and uncompensated. Each data element over which any given model on the market is trained - whether an image, recording, or text - was either created or curated by a human being. Even in a future scenario where &quot;synthetic data&quot; becomes widely used (if even possible) this amounts to little more than data laundering as the models creating that synthetic data were first trained on data generated through human labor.<br/><br/>There have been countless comparisons between this process and how humans build off one another. Proponents argue that software developers ought to be able to stuff more data into their models than any single human could physically &quot;ingest&quot; in a lifetime. This is not only specious and absurd - one might as well argue that cars should share the sidewalk because, just like humans, they also move from point A to point B - it ignores why we accept human inspiration as &quot;novel&quot; and separate from rote copying in the first place. Our unique agentic experiences - something which all deep learning models (the totality of generative AI applications as they exist today) lack - color our interpretation and perception of the works we encounter. No two human beings will have, simply by nature of their unique life experiences, the same mechanical interpretation of an image. For any generative model the &quot;interpretation&quot; will always be more or less the same - for an image an array of positions and color values defining a pixel grid, for a recording a waveform, and so on.<br/><br/>All of the value of these models comes from the human labor on which they are built. Developers should not be able to distribute or sell models trained on data which they have not consensually obtained the rights to. By the same token copyright should never extend to mere usage of a model and its output. Much the same as copyright already never extends to the mere usage of somebody else&#39;s work.<br/><br/>Maybe one day there will be a machine that&#39;s capable of creating through its own perception and experiences. Little makes me doubt that. But that machine doesn&#39;t exist today. <br/><br/>I believe a fair understanding of copyright per the U.S. constitution and the general history of the concept is that the primary intent is to create market conditions that favor creators of new works over publishers of existing works. In a market without copyright, publishers will routinely out-compete creators disincentivizing the creation of new works. Developers, purveyors, and rote users of generative AI models act more as publishers than creators. The creators in this ecosystem are still human beings.<br/><br/>If model developers are required to respect copyright we can have a vibrant, healthy, and productive creative market. AI developers will be forced to pivot from building tools that launder human labor, plagiarize, and disempower human artists to building tools that support and enable human artists to reach ever greater heights.
