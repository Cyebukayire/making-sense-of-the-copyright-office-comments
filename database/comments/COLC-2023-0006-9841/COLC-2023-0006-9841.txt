Generative AI as a means of full-on replacing human labor should be illegal. These machine learning algorithms are trained on real art, ingested into the data set without the consent of the original artist and used to generate &quot;new&quot; artwork. The only generative AI that should be even remotely allowed is one in which the creators of whatever content the AI is trained on have complete and utter control over how their content is used and be able to monetize it. In nearly ever other way, however, this technology is being used to steal and profit from the hard work of real human beings. Unacceptable.
