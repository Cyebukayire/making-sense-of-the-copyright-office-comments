I am a makeup artist in the film and tv industry. My job is to take a character from a script and cohesively design a character with serveral other departments of creatives. I use experiences from my life as well as other references (art, history, nature, etc) to create nuances in the character that make a character further convey what they are there to put forward into the story. It subtle but it helps an audience connect with the character. AI replacing me would take the heart, soul, and creativity that is filmmaking. People want to see authentic characters they can relate to, and that comes with humans making the choices for these character looks, not a computer
