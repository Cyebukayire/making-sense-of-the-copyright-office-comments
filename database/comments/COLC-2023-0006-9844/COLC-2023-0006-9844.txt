I am an actor and singer and writer and artist and I urge all in charge of oversight of AI developments to take great care when making decisions on this issue. The ability for the public to discern authenticity is imperative to every pillar of society. We&rsquo;re already seeing abuse of stealing artists work and personalities (Tom Hanks likeness being stolen to sell a product he had nothing to do with for instance.) I do believe that AI can be a useful tool, but the rights of AI must not be held with more value that the rights of actual people. It is my string recommendation that ALL art created with AI be labeled as such, like we label smoking, like we label poisons, like we label foods, like we label ingredients. ALL art created with AI should have a universally understood highly visible and un-eraseable watermark that denotes it as such. Without this, I believe society is doomed.
