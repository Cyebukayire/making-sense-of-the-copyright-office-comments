We need copyright protection to protect human job and artists work. AI is nothing more that disgusting plagiarism. If film workers looses this fight hundreds of thousands of people will loose there careers, their livelihoods. If we don&#39;t create regulations and rules with AI we will be living in a world where robots are creating art about human lives and emotions. And that is probably the sadness and scariest thing someone, like myself, with a career in the film industry and arts could think of. I love my job with all my heart and I don&#39;t want to loose it to AI.
