I think an important question to consider is how will any of this be enforced? If AI work can&#39;t be copyrighted than what will stop a person from claiming it is their own? Isn&#39;t this an unsolved issue with universities, students and ChatGPT? You can already run some pretty sophisticated chat and art programs locally. I worry that in the pursuit of preventing AI work from being copyrighted we will be setting ourselves up for surveillance and possibly hardware restrictions. Maybe a solution would be to go back to copyright renewals. Maybe make it increasingly expensive to renew as time goes on. That might dampen a possible problem with copyright trolls.
