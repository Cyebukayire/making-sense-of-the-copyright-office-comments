The current AI models have been unethically sourced and have stolen art from creators without their consent. We live in a capitalist society where art is a form of asset which is a form of capital. When that is taken from someone under the guise of research and turned around to be sold for profit and then used as data to be sold for profit it&#39;s not only unjust and unethical but it breaks the very structures in place that allow us to strive for excellence and make money on our own merits. It&#39;s stealing food from our tables and roofs from over our heads. It&#39;s been proven time and time again that without the &quot;good data points&quot; (aka incredible art created by humans for humans) that these machine learning algorithms do not function as well and cannot create such high fidelity and quality work. Thus incentivizing these companies to steal further and laugh on the way to the bank as our representatives and government scramble to catch up. The damage has been done but the parties involved can still be held accountable for their thievery and deception. This is one of many small steps we can take to ensuring AI is done with consent and compensation for the parties who are tossed into their artificial meat grinders.
