AI as a tool to speed and assist actual artists on the job is one thing. Generative AI turning no skill or ambition, into profit and opportunity directly taken out of the hands of hardworking freelancers, designers, entrepreneurs is a massive issue. It should be upheld that by law an artist&#39;s works whether  online and digital or physically tangible and hanging on a wall, are both given protections similar to any other copyright. Ownership should be always defaulted to the creator until the creator consents to other use, or is fairly compensated for their efforts. <br/><br/>Any failure to protect creative works inside our current capitalistic system, is a failure to treat creatives the same as everyone else. It would be a national shame to allow creatives to be victimized by the greed of grifters, scam artists and scalpers in the name of corporate profit and power, rather than giving creatives the respect and autonomy and power they deserve to have over what they create.
