AI Art and writing samples works from real life artists and authors. The work is derivative at best and at worst can feature full on clippings of the individuals&#39; works that have been sampled. Many AI produced images feature multiple art styles in a single image. <br/><br/>Using AI for final products is an insult to the labor and practice of artists that have spent years of their life studying their craft. We cannot and should not condone the use of AI over a real human being&#39;s work. Even factory lines require humans to operate. AI is theft.
