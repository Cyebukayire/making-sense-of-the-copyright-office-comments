As an artist AI is not something that should be allowed to steal and reproduce an inferior product in mass it hurts those who make their career off the arts because if the AI can just copy and reproduce something in mass then it basically kills the art industry and can lead to many people losing their jobs. If AI wasn&#39;t allowed to steal art from others to reference for it&#39;s mass production then that would be different but in order for it to learn it has to steal and that isn&#39;t okay. I really hope that AI is banned from being used as a  way for people to profit because it genuinely is a spit int he face to those that work hard and put the time and effort into learning their craft because if an AI can just use their work to learn and produce something in a split second it puts them out of a job and if it is allowed to be copyrighted then people will essentially lose all ownership of their art styles and abilities because a random AI company or individual decided to copyright something that truly at the root of things isn&#39;t theirs.<br/><br/>Please consider how many individuals it will hurt and how many industries int he arts will crumble and know that it is wrong and a huge spit in the face to those that work hard to learn and study for years at a craft. AI is not art and the people who make it using stolen assets are no artists they are those who are taking a shortcut and who don&#39;t truly care about who they hurt and take down in the long run because it&#39;s a quick buck for them now and allowing copyright for that would only allow them to hurt more and more artists out there in the world there are so many people who work hard and spend years practicing and honing their crafts. Please give the respect and care to those who didn&#39;t give permission for their work to be used as a learning tool to be mass produced and essentially stolen. Thank you for reading.
