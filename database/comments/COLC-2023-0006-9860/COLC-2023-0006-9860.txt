I think that Ai is shit from the information i have collected over time. I dont want peoples artworks to be stolen and fed into these ai generators to create something based on things that has been stolen. I dont like how Ai ruins peoples lives through companies deciding to use AI and firing people originally doing the job just because thry wanna exploit free things and save in a few extra bucks for their yachts while there are people in need of jobs to feed their families! THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WENT TO SCHOOL AND ARE CURRENTLY IN DEBT SO THEY CAN WORK WITH WHAT THEY LOVE.<br/><br/>Ai that steals and takes away jobs from LIVING AND BREATHING people shouldnt exist.
