AI-generated works are dependent on the source material fed into them, especially in the case of art. When this includes copyrighted works, they can get reflected in the generated works due to the lack of discrimination in what is being fed into the machine. Much of the source material is also taken from artists and creators who do not consent to their work being used in such a manner. This is theft and plagiarism. Even if AI generated works cannot go away completely, they still need to be regulated in a manner that prevents unauthorized usage of other&#39;s works in order to train an AI.
