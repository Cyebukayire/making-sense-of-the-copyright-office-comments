I&#39;m a creative writer, the author of novels, stories, essays and popular science books. This is my life, and though I barely make a living, it&#39;s what I have to offer. People enjoy and learn from my books. Unregulated generative AI threatens not only my livelihood, but the literary culture I contribute to. (It is already a problem that my publishers and I depend on sales of books, and yet those books are constantly being pirated and distributed online.)
