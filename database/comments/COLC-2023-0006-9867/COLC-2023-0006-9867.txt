I&#39;m a professional editor, writer, and translator. AI feels very threatening to my profession and sense of academic integrity. It is alsp a danger to humanity in general because it lacks human discernment and analytical ability when constructing a response to a prompt. There are enough people in the world who display the Dunning-Kruger effect; AI invites that in spades. We already rely on devices to remember things for us; we don&#39;t need AI to &quot;think&quot; for us, too.
