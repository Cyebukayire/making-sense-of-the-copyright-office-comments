Artwork produced using AI exploits the work of real artists, against their will, in a way that is neither constructive or transformational of their work.<br/><br/>&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is actually incorrect terminology to use, as far as how these programs work. <br/>They are not intelligent, but rather calculating machines, capable of interpreting hundreds of patterns at once and averaging/amalgamating them in different ways, to produce an infinite number of potential images.<br/>&quot;Patterns&quot; in this case, referring to explicit stylistic flourishes and design choices made by human artists across their works of art.<br/>The most pressing concern of this, is that there are only so many human artists out there, and that number gets shaved slimmer and slimmer when you narrow them down by WHAT they express in their artwork, HOW they express it, how skillfully they render it, and et cetera. <br/>And of course, when AI is used to generate an image, the operators normally ask for images with explicit subjects, in a certain style, and to be the most skillful or desirable looking example of such category.<br/>As such, when called upon to create specific images, even AI with access to the entire internet&#39;s worth of images can do nothing but infringe on the work of a select number of specific artists at any one time. Extracting explicit visual information from their work and cobbling it back together. <br/>Not even in a constructive or transformative way, as these machines&#39; goal is to create an image as faithful to the given prompt as possible&mdash;in other words, as faithful to the sampled work as possible.<br/>Specific elements from the works of specific artists ARE being stolen from. <br/><br/>As many of these AI programs DO have access to the entire internet, there is no way to trust what they will and won&#39;t steal. No way to reliably restrict their usage or access except by discouraging it through legislation.<br/>As such, severe action should be taken against AI generated artwork and its usage.<br/>This matter is as simple as whether an artist has ownership of their own work and deserves say over what it&#39;s used for, including whether it&#39;s literally copied from. The answer is of course, yes.
