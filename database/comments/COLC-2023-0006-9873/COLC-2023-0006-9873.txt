Because publicly accessible data, including diverse data owned by people and companies, is largely the basis for Generative AI, (while the algorithms and privately-held data that are used to better the models may be kept private and be owned by the companies), the model weights and outputs must be released to the public and the public should be allowed unrestricted access to them.<br/><br/>The model weights were created almost entirely with data not owned by the AI companies, and so these companies cannot own them or hold them back from the public.
