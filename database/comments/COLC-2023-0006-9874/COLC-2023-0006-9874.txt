One the subject of subject of copyrighting the output of an AI model:  I think the output of an AI model should be treated the same as the subject of a photograph.  And a work based on it (yes it could be a pixel by pixel copy) should be treaded the same as the photograph.  If I generate an image from a prompt and publish it the image would have equal protection as a photograph today.  However, if someone else used the same prompt and generated the same image they would also be able to use it and have a copyright on it.  This is much the same as with a photograph were two photographers can take a picture of the same subject and both have a copyright to that picture.  The AI tools would have to generate a signature that includes all the information necessary to reproduce the prompt and resultant image (prompt, model name, and version may be sufficient).  Anyone wanting to exercise copyright rights would have to be able to produce this signature.  This would prove that they had generated the image and not copied someone else&#39;s.
