As many have stated in other comments, I feel it is imperative that governmental regulations are set in place to protect artists of all media types (photography, video, painters, musicians, sculptors, writers, and any other types of artists). Most artists struggle to survive without having to rely on other ways to generate income.<br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence models must be required to ask for permission to use any artist&#39;s work to train their models. Any revenue generated by those A.I. models should be shared with the artists whose works were used to generate the A.I.&#39;s output.<br/><br/>Additionally, a person&#39;s likeness - whether living or dead - should not be used to train any A.I. models without that person, or a living member of the deceased&#39;s family, opting into the training of that model. Any use of a person&#39;s likeness should not be used without amicable compensation between the company who has developed the A.I. model and the person whose likeness has been used. This should apply to any immediate payments as well as royalties going forward from any continuing revenues generated by that output.<br/><br/>The corresponding output from the A.I. should also declare that it was created using A.I. and give recognition to the artists or person(s) whose work was used to generate that output. <br/><br/>Any A.I. output that is found to be defaming in any way should be easy to remove from the internet and other sources. A person should be able to go to a national registry asking for removal of the offending output. Then, for instance, a copy of the outputted files should be added to a database declaring who created the output, when it was created, and who was negatively affected by the output. The output should also be analyzed by A.I. to detect future postings of the same, or modified, versions of that output. The training of the recognition of those files will help to recognize and remove that item in the future.
