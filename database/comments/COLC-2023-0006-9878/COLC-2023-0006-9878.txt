AI has potential like nothing seen before to wreak havoc socially, politically, and economically. <br/><br/>It is already massively displacing jobs and focusing revenue flow towards a few companies with an eerie resemblance to all of the great dystopian predictions. <br/><br/>We don&#39;t just need guardrails on it; we need heavy taxation and oversight as nothing good happens to a society or culture when its people lose their work and purpose. <br/><br/>The tech companies and proponents are mostly positive about its leverage but in all reality we are looking at the potential devastation of large portions of the white collar economy and where are the taxes going to come from then..? How will roads be paid for? How will our infrastructure be maintained? <br/><br/>Their narrative of it freeing up people from the more basic aspects of their working lives is frankly disingenuous. Entry level corporate jobs are rapidly disappearing REF: https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-halts-hiring-for-7800-jobs-that-could-be-replaced-by-ai-report-2023-5?op=1 Where will those people go? Where will they learn needed skills? Where will the evaporated taxes from their paychecks be replaced from?<br/><br/>The narrative that it will allow people to live the life they want is usually told by someone with a large 401k or stock portfolio. The average American struggles with life financially at a daily level and are not living in the financial utopia these characters are in. <br/><br/>The harsh reality is that AI is here and what is still missing are guard rails for so much (socially, politically, economically, culturally, etc.) that it&#39;s just not going to work out well. It would bode well to look to the past for lessons and amongst them the tidbit that NO empire/culture has survived long once it lost control of the &quot;truth&quot;/narrative or of the contentment of its working peoples. <br/><br/>
