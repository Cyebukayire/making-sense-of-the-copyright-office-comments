I am very concerned that artificial intelligence will cause serious problems for the world in the future. Also AI should not br cooyrightsble becayse it is not generated by a being who is requesting copyright privileges. It should not be used to generate printed materials as there are no checks on authenticity or facts. It must not be capable of generating art that is like or similar to works by artists currently in existence including music, clothing, paintings, etc. It is dangerous and must be heavily restricted and regulated.
