AI has already shown lots of damage, and our inability to keep up with legislation to address that. This isn&#39;t new to us with technology, where in our history we had instances of people not understanding how facebook worked. Similarly, how much of our data is now being sold and shared, without us the consumers getting a cut of those profits (as they certainly didn&#39;t have my permission to do that).<br/><br/>Digression aside, I don&#39;t trust that AI can ever be used for good in the hands of corporations, or by our political system in general. At best, trusted in the hands of creatives, scientists, using it for the good of humanity. Regardless, I don&#39;t think we should be using AI at all, and something that needs to quickly have very strict regulation, if not outright banning of its technology.
