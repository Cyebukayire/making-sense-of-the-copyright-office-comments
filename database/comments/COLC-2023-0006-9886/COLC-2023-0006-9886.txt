Generative AI algorithms are not sentient human beings and the argument that their education is similar to a child absorbing content has no legal substance.  If left unregulated, these plagiarizing chatbots will render all copyright laws meaningless.<br/><br/>Copyrighted content (including but not limited to voices, images, writing, music, and digital algorithms) used to train these programs must be completely scrubbed as a first-line remedy via new regulation. Any future training must require the company to reach out to the rights owner to opt-in and offer the opportunity to seek compensation.  <br/><br/>An opt-out model places undue burden on content creators. No single person could possibly manage the thousands of AI programs in existence and will be created in the future.<br/><br/>Please structure all future regulations and legislation to protect intellectual property by default and give no deference to industry lobbyists seeking to legalize theft. Copyrighted content must be afforded full protection, as intended by article 1, section 8, clause 8 of the US Constitution. <br/><br/>
