As a professional artist I am extremely concerned about the impact AI will have, and already has had on the industry. Not only is it scraping artists images already available online, but is almost impossible to opt out any further image use of new artworks uploaded. The internet is where I have gained the most collectors and exposure to galleries both nationally and internationally. To remove my internet presence to safeguard my artwork would result in the destruction of my business. Though this issue goes beyond just a legal and ethical matter, to the very core of what art means to society and history, I will address it as a pure copyright issue. My sculptural style is likely more difficult to be copied by AI, but many artists who produce digital and traditional paintings are struggling to keep their works from being stolen and used in these AI generators. These works were absolutely not designed to be used in this manner and the artists absolutely did not give permission for it to be used this way. These programs are built on the backs of countless artists who have not consented to their work being used and are not being compensated in any way. Whatever romantic notion the world has placed on the profession of &lsquo;artist&rsquo; at the end of the day we are small business owners and entrepreneurs who work extremely hard. Our style and products are what we have to offer, and how we survive. These AI systems are creating &lsquo;fun&rsquo; new programs that will generate serious income for the developers, but do not in any way support the artists without whom they could not exist.
