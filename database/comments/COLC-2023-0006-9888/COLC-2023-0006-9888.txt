The global art market exceeds 50 billion dollars annually. Most of this money historically has been decentralized because an individual artist can only make so many paintings in their life.  A.i. generated art threatens the entire art market and it also has the ability to concentrate wealth in the hands of foreign hostile governments and organizations.  If the United States and allied forign democracies do not pass some kind of law/treaty a.i. has the power to manipulate the entire population.  The time has come that some a.i. images are indistinguishable to the untrained eye and can be used to amplify the worst parts of society with propoganda and misinformation. Even informed people are being tricked.  I myself have had my original art stolen from me, then the digital thief was so bold as to tell me what he was doing, he used my art against my will to make an a.i. generated image and then claimed it as his own.  An artist may spend days weeks or months on a single image but an a.i. program can launder the stolen intellectual property the digital 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s that make up a digital image and they can do it at an alarming rate.  Thousands of images per day can be stolen and deposited across social media and other parts of the internet making it increasingly hard for real original legitimate content to even be seen because most search engine algorithms give weight to newer content vs. Old so because real art and real photography and real journalism is and always will be slower than a.i. it will be demoted in the search fields and the fake a.i. content will be promoted at great detriment to the artists the photographers the writers the journalists .. and it gets worse.<br/><br/>The reputations of everyone is at risk when a.i. can be used to manufacture fake evidence of a crime.  <br/><br/>A.i. generated images may even find their way into courtrooms to convict innocent people of crimes they didn&#39;t commit. <br/><br/>A.i. can affect our national defense, by making the good guys look bad and the bad guys look good. <br/><br/>The use of A.i. should therfore be tightly regulated, limited and in some instances entirely prohibited.  The congress and courts need time to adapt to the changing risks.
