I am a voice actor, and my husband is a visual artist. We are both very concerned about AI and copyright. Aside from the very human issues of art being connected to empathy, and what makes us human, I&#39;m concerned for the future of my liveliehood. I do not want people to be feed my work into a program that learns how I sound, and what I do with my voice. That is all from my lived experience and my hard work and training. No one else should get to use it.
