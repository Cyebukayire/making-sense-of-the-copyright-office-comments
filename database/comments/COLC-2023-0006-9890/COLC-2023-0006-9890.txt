Just because something is available on the internet, that doesn&#39;t mean that content can be freely used in the creation of a commercial product. Even if the copywritten content itself isn&#39;t explicitly stored in the resulting product, AI companies don&#39;t have permission to utilize these assets in the creation of their products. For artistic works, many training sets will pull from sources that do not verify the legality of the content being uploaded. Even if the original source was uploaded to a service that these companies aren&#39;t allowed to scrape data from, they&#39;ll often get the data anyways from some other location that a random person uploaded a copy to.<br/><br/>AI proponents will say things like how it&#39;s just like a person learning from the examples of others, but this is a deliberate misdirection and misrepresentation of the point at hand. Physical and digital concepts do not correlate 1:1 with each other. A person is a singular sapient/sentient physical entity that is limited to doing one thing at a time. No reasonable person would claim that this is equivalent to numerous digital services running algorithms that can each scale to an unlimited number of instances/copies simultaneously.<br/><br/>Personally, as a result of the lack of accountability and ethics that these services promote, I am no longer able to enjoy art as I once did before early 2022 when these services were launched. Now whenever I see new art, I have to worry about whether it&#39;s something that was actually made by the artist, or if it&#39;s yet another instance of someone trying to pass off AI work (even if just AI-assisted) as being wholly their own. Everyone is now saddled with the burden of having to prove they did things themselves. Because AI companies rushed in an attempt to make money from these services, they neglected to consider how their actions would affect others, and now the credibility of entire industries have been irreparably harmed.<br/><br/>I have seen firsthand how artists whose styles are often imitated by these systems have been accused of using AI. I&#39;ve also seen promising artists succumb to the pressure to use AI and end up losing their own styles that made them interesting in the first place. Unfortunately, AI companies don&#39;t care about what they&#39;re destroying. Instead, they&#39;re focused on unrealistic &quot;ideal scenarios&quot; and making a profit.
