Before recording tech (magnetic ribbon and wax cylinders) concerts and music score publishers with your own instrument, were the only way to hear popular music. Song writers and publishers railed against allowing recordings, (&#39;a machine can take our jobs&#39;). When music started becoming digitally produced, musicians (who benefited from the recording tech) railed against electronic musicians and producers. Many musicians use older works as inspiration, and in some cases use stanzas from songs off-copyright (see Hedwigs theme and Swan Lake, and dozens more examples). This type of inspiration has been used throughout many different types of art. A person who can&#39;t read music and can&#39;t play an instrument can create music, they can use pre-recorded and digitally produced sounds to make a new song. They can use reverb, and all sorts of effects that musicians used to travel all over the world to hear. This battle has already been fought and decided. Music created from close inspiration is required to pay money to the original artist.<br/><br/> When digital graphic design started out, artists were furious, now they use it. Artists are literally taught to &quot;do x in the style of z&quot;, they are taught how to copy each other so they might be better. So is AI taught to react to what the author wants. Why should visual artists be treated differently by the copyright office compared to audio artists? <br/><br/>If artwork is in the public domain, then it should be used to train AI, just like the millions of classical pieces are used to do the same. If an artists work wasn&#39;t public domain, it should be removed from the software that was trained on it. But, be made aware that a person could prompt AI enough to copy a copyrighted work. The original artist is still the owner, and AI wasn&#39;t to blame. Does this mean someone could pump out a ton of visual art, yes, does this happen in the audio world too, yes. Copyright law would be settled in the same manner.<br/><br/>I think the specific wording of the prompts (that are put into AI) should be the copyright. As such, only a human inputing the prompts (or writing the code that inputs prompts) can be allowed to own the copyright. AI may be sophisticated, but it is still a tool that needs an authors hand to work, and needs an experienced eye to make it good. Even if a person were to write a computer code that created the prompts, the person responsible for the code is the author.
