As an artist and former journalist I cannot stress strongly enough how much Artificial Intelligence (AI) must be monitored and regulated, especially to protect original creative work AND, also importantly, to prevent the dissemination of distorted or completely false &quot;information&quot;. For example, I&#39;ve seen videos featuring well-known public figures saying, frankly, outrageous things -- all AI generated. Some people already have a difficult enough time processing news; AI does not need to complicate that further.
