Generative AI is an amazing tool for creators and the way it learns by analyzing existing images in order to learn how to create new ones should be considered fair use, since the AI is not copying the original images, it&rsquo;s learning that certain pixel relationships will create certain images, just like how a person can learn that making two dots above a curved line can make a smiley face just by looking at another person&rsquo;s drawing. As a working artist, I think that generative AI is an incredible tool for creation that is being thoroughly misunderstood and demonized simply because people are afraid of this new technology. I think that this tech can be misused (as can all useful tech), but I think it&rsquo;s so incredible, useful, and groundbreaking that it would be a shame to heavily restrict this tool in order to punish a minority of users.
