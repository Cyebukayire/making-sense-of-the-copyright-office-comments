Ai trained materials should not be copyrightable. I have seen the argument that it&rsquo;s similar to an artist taking reference and transforming it, however I view it closer as to when an artist uses collage materials that can be readily identifiable in the final work - although the argument can be made that it is transformative, precedents in law have established that this is a form of infringement. I believe AI materials should be held to the same regard. Especially if someone has done none or little post processing to the resultant image.
