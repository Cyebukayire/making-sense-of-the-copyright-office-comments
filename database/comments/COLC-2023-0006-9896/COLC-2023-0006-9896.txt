I think the copyright concerns of artists claiming infringement are valid to a point.  If someone uses generative AI to copy their work, that should be illegal.  However we all sign terms of service every day allowing scraping and use of literally everything we post. Whether for search engine indexing or use by social media algorithms, we agree for machines to &ldquo;view&rdquo; our work all the time. Artists benefit from this every day.  The ability we have today to reach an audience and sell our work is unprecedented.  Artists do not get to cry foul now.<br/><br/>Another artist learns to make art the same way machines do.  Namely by looking at and incorporating ideas and techniques that went before.  As long as they aren&rsquo;t copying another&rsquo;s work, this is completely fine. The only difference with machines doing the same thing is scale.  I find the objection to machines looking at and learning from others work as hollow. <br/><br/>Generative models do not make copies, they make new works.  Can a user, and the key here is USER force them to copy.  Sure.  But they could do that with so many other tools.  Yet we don&rsquo;t try to ban Photoshop.  We hold the person who copied accountable. <br/><br/>I am completely fine with the idea that the outputs of a generative program aren&rsquo;t copyrightable.  If those outputs are blended and acted upon by a human to a large enough degree, over 50 percent, then that work should be copyrightable.  <br/><br/>Truth is, the democratization of art is here.  There is no way to close Pandora&rsquo;s box, nor should we.  Just like electricity, photography, even the advent of digital painting revolutionized arts and crafts, so too will AI. And each time, a frightened few made the same arguments to stop progress a handful of vocal artists are now.  We can&rsquo;t let their spurious objections make poor policy.<br/><br/>I say this as a visual artist and published author.  Not all of us agree with the vocal few.
