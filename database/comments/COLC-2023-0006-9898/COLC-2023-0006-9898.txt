What the generative AI tools are doing is no different than an individual downloading each individual copyrighted work, cutting and pasting it to create a new image, and putting some sort of filter on top to blur the edges. Producing work in this manner for commercial use is highly illegal, and even producing work by tracing over another artist&#39;s work is scandalous in the art community. AI doing the downloading and copying for you should be treated the same. The current state of AI generated artwork has served to devalue the skills that artists have developed to render high quality images from their imagination, and shatter the communities that individuals have built up in order to make a living. People who have spent their lives making art are now isolated and threatened by companies seeking to mine through their portfolios, feed a machine that cobble faces and textures together, and sell this lower quality product as a reproduction of their work without any acknowledgement or compensation to the original artist. Artists are now being told that their work looks like it came out of a machine, or that they should get a new job because they are no longer valued for the skills they built their career on. Artists are being stripped for resources by these ai tech companies like colonists ravging a fertile land. <br/><br/>
