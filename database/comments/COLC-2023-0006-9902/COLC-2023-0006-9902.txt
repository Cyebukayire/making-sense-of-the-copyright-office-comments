I am a traditional pastel artist. AI models used art like mine without consent or payment in order to create its images. So this basically diminished copyrights for traditional artists. Now AI prompters want copyright for the images generated by AI models, that used traditional artists images to be even be able to exist. It seems like it&#39;s taking rights away from artists and transferring them to the people who use AI. I think that work created by a human should have more copyright protection then work generated by a machine, or at the very least gave equal rights to it. I understand that there is human intelligence and creativity that goes into creating the prompts for AI, so I do understand why prompt creators would want copyright protection. I think there is an argument that really advanced and complex prompts have copyrights, as that was created by human, But not the actual image generated as a result of the prompt, because the image was still made by the AI models. <br/><br/>I think AI can be useful for so many people, it&#39;s just important that we protect the rights and the content of the humans who made the original content that AI is using to be able to even work.
