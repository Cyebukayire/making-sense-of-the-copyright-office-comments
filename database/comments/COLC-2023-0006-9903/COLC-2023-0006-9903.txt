<br/>Imagine AI as a painter&#39;s brushstroke, a versatile instrument capable of crafting magnificent works of art, yet it remains a tool, not the artist itself. The true artist is the one who carefully selects the colors, skillfully blends them, and deftly applies them to the canvas. In a parallel manner, the artist is the one who meticulously chooses the algorithm&#39;s parameters, curates the inputs, and guides the output of the AI.<br/><br/>When an artist employs AI to produce art, they retain creative dominion. They determine what the AI creates and how it&#39;s utilized. Just like any other artist, they rightfully deserve the protection of copyright.<br/><br/>Consider how many artists might have missed out on creating neo-expressionist masterpieces if they had never encountered the works of Basquiat. Would Dali have ventured into Surrealism, Cubism, Modern art, and Dada without the influence of Picasso, Miro, Ernst, and Tanguy?<br/><br/>Reflect on the multitude of tools available in software like Procreate, designed to assist artists in avoiding errors. How many shapes, shades, and effects are fashioned for artists utilizing such programs? Is it equitable to painters who work with traditional materials and cannot easily rectify their mistakes?<br/><br/>Art, I believe, is a universal expression of beauty, continually evolving, a catalyst for innovation and growth, rather than a target for unwarranted scrutiny or derision. Poets, novelists, and songwriters all craft with words&mdash;are they not all artists? What about those artists who interpret and perform songs composed by a team of writers or execute choreography created by choreographers while dancers replicate their moves?<br/><br/>Let us wholeheartedly embrace the future of AI in art, providing artists with the tools and support they require to create fresh, astonishing works of art. Let&#39;s also assure them the peace of mind that their creations are safeguarded by copyright.<br/>
