The advent of a new era in AI has created radical new disruptions in science and technology which shape human society dramatically over the coming decades. The people of the United States of America stand poised to reap a great windfall from this revolution, but such a position is precarious and may easily be supplanted by other nations with policies more favorable to the new age.<br/><br/>The Copyright Office administers not the legal embodiment of a set of rights for authors, but a social contract under which certain monopolies are granted in the expectation of societal benefit for all. The balance of this social contract has, sadly, been skewed over the decades to a point at which additions to the public domain now all but cease and vast, deeply entrenched media cartels are enriched even as they granted hugely lucrative and government-enforced control over virtually all modern culture of record, despite marginal costs of replication having fallen to zero and access to most forms of cultural creation now being leveled to anyone possessed of a common computer, drastically obviating the economic basis of these legal protections in most cases. All this diminishes the case for any extension of these protections over new domains (leaving aside entirely the question of whether they should actually be restricted).<br/><br/>Considering these two facts, it seems clear the Copyright Office can continue its auspicious policies of denying copyright protections over the output of machines - in so doing stopping a vast new denial of cultural freedom by the few at the expense of the many - whilst simultaneously securing an enormous social good for all: the advent of new artificial intelligences able to access the full breadth of all human knowledge for the benefit of all, without being subject to the informational fragmentation which would inevitably ensue were they to be denied proper sources of knowledge, just as a child is denied their future when deprived of an education, for the learning of a machine and that of a child are no different in this case.<br/><br/>It is also certainly not the case that there is any loss to society from these emerging man-made intelligences having the same access to information as any human pursuing an education might, and for that matter there is no loss to the copyright holders due to any information they imbibe not having been subject to the same constrictive monopolies they currently exploit. After all, being used to inform a model does not in any way deprive a copyright holder of a copyrighted good, an intangible notion or actual revenue. The only loss would be to the potential such nascent technology presents to all mankind.<br/><br/>In summary, the Office ought to stay its current course and allow this nascent field to developed unhindered.
