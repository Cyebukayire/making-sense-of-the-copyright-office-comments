I am a contributor to a popular LGPL licensed package. I strongly encourage you to stop the wide scale automated theft of the intellectual property of open source developers like myself.<br/><br/>My collaborators and I have given this code to the community for anyone to use and extend. Our work is used by hundreds of thousands of users including for profit companies who respect our license terms. We do this service with a simple ask in return: credit us and, in certain circumstances, release derivative code under the same license. Also, like many other projects, we ask for donations to continue supporting this resource and that attribution has monetary benefit.<br/><br/>A human developer using our code without respecting its terms clearly engages in theft. The failure to credit us reduces donations and the failure to release derivative code hurts our community. It is unclear why a robot doing the same would be any different. Indeed, as these AI tools have given their users open source code regurgitated without change or copied with only superficial modification without respecting the license, it acts simply as an accomplice to automated theft.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to address some companies talking about their R&amp;D expenses. Open source isn&rsquo;t free to make and comes with a cost: it has a price either in license terms of in compensation for alternative license purchase. There is a reason for this price tag: we the open source developer have paid with our time and non-profits or companies have paid developers to build open source. When large companies who use open source code without license compliance or compensation talk about the expense of the models they built, they ignore the fact that there was often a price tag to be paid which they ignored. The thief should not be able to complain about the costs they incurred in breaking a door or the price of gas needed to drive the getaway car. It remains theft no matter how expensive.<br/><br/>In short, I encourage you to hold these model developers accountable. Doing so respects our communities and does justice to the countless users and companies who rely on our work while respecting our licensing terms.
