Dear U.S. Copyright Office,<br/><br/>Below are my responses to the &quot;Copyrightability&quot; section of the questions raised by your office.<br/><br/>18. Yes, under the circumstance in which a human prompts an AI to produce a work, that work is copyrighted by the human doing the prompting.<br/><br/>19. No.<br/><br/>20. Yes, AI is analogous to a software like Photoshop. It is a tool that allows human to create copyrightable works, albeit a more complex and powerful one. No, it is not strictly necessary but likely to further incentivize development. If the Copyright Office decided works produced with Photoshop and similar software were not copyrightable, this tech would still be developed, but perhaps at a slower pace. Yes, but the Copyright Office does not appear to understand that existing copyright protections apply to AI-generated content.<br/><br/>20.1. It should be no different than any other work created by humans using tools that enable them to generate creative works.<br/><br/>21. If the Copyright Clause permits copyright protection for work generated in Photoshop and similar tools, then yes, as the same principal applies here. It is a difference in degree, not of kind. It would clearly &ldquo;promote the progress of science and useful arts,&quot; as failing to provide copyright protections for AI-generated works would disincentivize the use of AI in creative works. In turn, this would disincentivize AI companies from investing, as there would be a smaller market. In reality though, artists would likely simply conceal their use of AI, as this attempt to differentiate AI-generated works from non-AI-generated works is ultimately arbitrary and unenforceable. See, for example, &quot;Zarya of the Dawn.&quot; If the author hadn&#39;t explicitly stated the works were AI-generated, the Office would have retained protections for the work.<br/><br/>Sincerely yours,<br/><br/>Alexander Caro
