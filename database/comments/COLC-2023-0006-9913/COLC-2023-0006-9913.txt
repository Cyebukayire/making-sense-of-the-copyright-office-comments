I think AI is an incredibly worrying issue. Particularly in terms of ownership and fair compensation to both employees and artists. I&#39;d like to see legal stipulations and laws put in place to help with navigating these situations. The most important aspect is that no one loses rights to their own work and no one can use AI to steal others work or intrinsic style without just compensation. Also that employees laid off due to automation and ai have some form of compensation such as direct schooling paid for by the company that fired them so they can find new employment, ideally protected by law.
