I will repeat what my wife said, as she put it more eloquently than I.<br/>&quot;The question here is the use of stolen intellectual property being used to &ldquo;train&rdquo; a computer to use algorithms to generate new content to be sold based upon the stolen content. We have rules currently in place protecting current IP and providing for public domain content available for this same use. There is absolutely no reason to permit the theft of intellectual property from living artists and their immediate heirs for any reason, whether being done directly or by attempting to use computers to muddy the waters. Computers do not have actual intelligence  at this time, artificial or otherwise. They lack the capacity to think critically, to make moral decisions or to be held accountable for their actions. Once those citeria are met, perhaps this should be revisited. In the meantime, this question is about accountable human beings stealing the protected intellectual property of artists to sell for profit. The output is dependent upon the stolen content in order to produce the disputed products. There is ample public domain content available that can be utilized for these computer programs. The only reason for utilizing stolen protected content is to reproduce recognizable products for sale based upon the talents of the creators. The computer is not being used to produce something new, it is being used for counterfeiting.&quot;<br/><br/>I know some advocates of the current AI trend will defend the work citing Fair Use, but I would add that Fair Use is by a human creator and is often used as homage or critique. A computer is incapable of performing either.<br/><br/>
