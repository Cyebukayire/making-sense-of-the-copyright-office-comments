AI companies will have a series of arguments arguing against inspiration vs copying and where the line is and that their AI should fall under inspired works etc. etc. This is objectively false.<br/>In order to function and use a work as a training model an AI must have an *exact* copy of the original work. Possessing an exact copy that was not paid for is by definition theft.<br/>Disputing 5 most common arguments AI makers will use: <br/>1-copyright holders wouldn&#39;t get much money anyway- this is irrelevant to the argument. Works must be paid for, the supplier of work and market sets the price.<br/>2- It&#39;s like reading a book/being inspired-  an inspiration made by looking at the Mona Lisa does not require possession of the Mona Lisa. AI does, they are inherently different. It is not similar to reading a book or knowledge retention. If that were the case watermarks in AI generated art would not appear. What it is actually doing is stealing hundreds of pieces of art, and making a collage out of those works, without first paying for the pieces necessary to make said collage. If I as a person wanted to disassemble the pieces of various automobiles and then combine them into a new design, I still have to pay for the pieces first. AI generation is no different. <br/>3: It will hurt small AI developers- Irrelevant. Cost prohibitive productions are often unavailable. I cant make a sculpture out of solid gold without paying for it. Why should AI be any different? If AI developers believe their AI is a cost worthy endeavor than they can seek investors who agree with them like how every other business works.<br/>4: Current law is fine- objectively false, artists are creating work, not being paid for said work and objecting to the use of their work in AI. That should be copyright violation as a licensed work had an unauthorized use. A category to define how compensation or claim rights for the artist needs to exist.<br/>5-its fair use: this would only be true if an exact copy of the work was not required for training AI models, but exact copies *are* required. If an exact copy is possessed that was not paid for that is by definition theft
