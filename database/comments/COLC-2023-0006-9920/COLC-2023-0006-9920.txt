This is a post I made on FB and was shared thousands of times. <br/>So, there&#39;s an issue unfolding in the world that many people don&#39;t quite grasp and that&#39;s the impact of Ai.<br/><br/>A friend innocently sent me the photo above, which I could immediately tell was generated by Ai. However, not everyone can distinguish this, and therein lies the danger. (For clarity, I&#39;ve marked &quot;AI&quot; on the photo.)<br/><br/>People are seeing these miraculous sculptures or drawings and not give it a second thought as to if it&#39;s real or not. What&#39;s going to happen is everyone will be conditioned by seeing unrealistic work (because you can&#39;t carve a watermelon to look like that, it&#39;s just not possible) and when someone actually sees one of the best watermelon carvings by the best human watermelon carver on the planet, they won&#39;t be impressed because they&#39;ve been fooled and conditioned by Ai. This diminishes real (flesh and blood) artists.<br/><br/>I urge you all to be more critical when observing art. Many artists can quickly determine whether a piece is Ai-generated or created by a human. Currently, there&#39;s a specific look to these drawings, paintings, sculptures and they almost have an uncanny valley effect.  As AI technology advances, it&#39;s likely to become even more deceptive.<br/><br/>So, please, for the sake of human artists, look with a decerning eye and don&#39;t share Ai.
