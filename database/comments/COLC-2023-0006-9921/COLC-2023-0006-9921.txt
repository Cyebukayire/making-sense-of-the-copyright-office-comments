As an artist, I am absolutely disgusted by Ai. How dare these AI developers and companies steal millions of passionate works from artists with no compensation, melt it all together with no creative input or skill of their own, and spit the soulless mockeries back out at them, bragging about how replaceable artists are. <br/><br/>They have the gall to create &quot;opt-out&quot; options, essentially saying they will steal our work automatically, and it&#39;s the artists fault if they don&#39;t personally go to every Ai creator to say they do not consent after the fact. It&#39;s a purposefully disingenuous act that shows that Ai developers and companies are not even interested in behaving ethically or capable of regulating themselves, meaning it needs to be forced by the law.<br/><br/>Just because they are incapable of understanding the value of creating art with your own two hands doesn&#39;t mean they are free to disgrace and mutilate it.<br/><br/>Artificial intelligence has a lot of useful utility in rote, but using it in art is both unethical &amp; dystopian.<br/><br/>We are discussing the idea of trading a key facet of humanity for a bit more convenience, the commodification of passion &amp; transforming expression into a factory line. Destroying art just for money and greed.<br/><br/>My wish is for every generative ai model trained on STOLEN art, images, even music, voices and text, to be banned, outlawed. Which would currently mean banning every single one, because Ai cannot exist without the theft of the work of actually talented and hardworking individuals. It cannot exist without the artists the AI developers are gleefully trying to disenfranchise.
