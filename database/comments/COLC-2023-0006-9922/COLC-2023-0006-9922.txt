The companies behind AI development admit themselves that their language learning models are trained on stolen (or more euphemistically, &quot;scraped&quot;) books, images, and other materials. Their argument is that they can&#39;t turn a profit if they pay writers and artists for their work. They expect artists and writers to contribute their knowledge, training, years of practice at their craft, and hours spent at work for free so that investors can profit instead of the artists themselves. It&#39;s a despicable stance, on its face, and would drive generations of creative minds into bankruptcy. All in the name of corporate profits. Their claim of &quot;fair use&quot; is also absurd, as they are directly profiting from copyrighted work. If they want to train their LLMs on an artist&#39;s work, hire the artist. But allowing companies to profit off stolen work opens the door for continued abuses. What use is copyright if not for situations like this? It&#39;s hard to earn a living as a writer, as I well know. It&#39;s a lesson these tech companies should have to learn too.
