 I work in the field of AI as a cybersecurity analyst. As a hobby, I also write and draw, and sometimes share my works online.<br/><br/>I see great potential for AI, but also am deeply concerned about the way AI companies are trying to strip away the rights of people to their own creations, from coders to designers. In school, I was taught not to treat everything on the internet as free, and how to properly cite and use works in my academic projects. It seems that AI companies have a freedom to steal that even school children do not.<br/><br/>One of the arguments in favor of AI companies&rsquo; data theft is that they are creating transformative works. I feel strongly in favor of human produced transformative works. However, the creations of AI are not transformative works. They are pieces of software built using stolen data that are being used for profit by corporations. <br/><br/>Allowing corporations to continue using copyrighted work they do not own will only increase the already alarming amount of data collection and surveillance that is occurring by companies worldwide. It will have a chilling affect on creatives of all types, and will stop many people from sharing their works with the global community. <br/><br/>It will also prevent AI from growing in a responsible way. AI has great potential to help shape the future of technology that I do want to encourage. Yes, it will cost companies and individuals more to create models. However, this will lead to safer, smaller models suited for specific tasks instead of the large, all-consuming models who have as many risks as they do benefits. <br/><br/>Please uphold copyright protections of individuals, and require AI companies to pay for or ethically source the data they use to build their software. Protect the small artists and writers and coders, not the giant companies who wish to grind up our intellectual property and use it to profit themselves.
