AI developers and models should NOT be able to use copyrighted works. And in no way should AI generated code, art or writings be copywritable. Citizens, HUMANS should have control ober theor creative output, not machines and corporations who put no actual effort into that artistic creation. To do otherwise would be immoral and likely put almost all creatives out of a livelyhood.
