AI is allowing others to profit off of the hard work of artists without compensating them. In addition, some art does not run afoul of copyright laws because it is free, making it fair use. AI has now created a scenario where the artist cannot profit from the art they made due to copyright laws, but someone can steal it through AI and profit off of it themselves, despite having no hand in the creation of any of the pieces used to &quot;train&quot; the AI. On top of that, companies insisting they have ethically sourced the art used to train their programs are instead using other AI creations or data pools, meaning the original artists have still not been compensated or given permission for their work to be used in such a way. Another problem with this lack of oversight is AI is also being used to spread fake news using the likenesses of existing public figures. Much more oversight is needed over this industry, since it&#39;s clear the people involved have no interest in any kind of ethics or responsibility.
