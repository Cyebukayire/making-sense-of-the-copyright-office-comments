Some sort of regulatory structure MUST be made. Large companies are reaping the benefits of every artist in history and don&#39;t think they should pay anyone just because the amount paid to each person would be small. That is an obvious misdirection and an outright acknowledgement that they are copying works for their own profit. We also cannot squeeze the life out of this industry, as other countries may then outpace us. Perhaps instead of attempting each and every single artist is paid fairly, a tax could be placed on AI companies, the monies from which would go into a fund for the arts; perhaps art supplies in schools, art degree scholarships, some kind of support structure for artists of all types, or something else.<br/>This is a difficult decision for sure. We are on the bleeding edge of history. We must be creative and anticipatory.
