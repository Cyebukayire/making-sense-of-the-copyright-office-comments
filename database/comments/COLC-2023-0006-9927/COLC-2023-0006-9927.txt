If an American Citizen pirated copyrighted content, even if they never published it, and the American Government found out, they&#39;d be in serious trouble. There was even a huge ad campaign in the 90s and early 2000s about it. There is still an FBI warning before movies and tvs shows on streaming and home replay mediums. Yet, if an AI does it, or any computer program does it, that&#39;s not illegal? If I took 1 second each minute each from 7200 movies and edited it together and sold it as a movie, I would be guilty of 7200 counts related to copyright abuse and maybe even theft if I didn&#39;t pay for those movies. But if AI does it or takes 1 little bit from a thousand copyrighted images to make one supposedly new image, it is somehow supposed to be looked at differently? This is heinous. What if in the near future one of these AI powered robots kills a human. Would that then not be murder? Because letting these companies, run by Humans, pretend they arent breaking clear and useful laws and abusing creators and profiting from copyrights, trademarks and IPs they have no rights or permissions to sets that precedent. If it isnt theft when AI steals as directed by humans, one day it won&#39;t be fraud when they steal your bank info by pretending to be the bank at the behest of a human bad actor, and when someone tells an AI to kill someone, it won&#39;t be murder. Is that what we want???
