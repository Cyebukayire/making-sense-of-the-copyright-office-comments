I do not believe AI work should be under copyright because it wasn&rsquo;t created by a human. The idea wasn&rsquo;t created by anyone, rather generated by something without a consciousness. A living, breathing entity isn&rsquo;t tied to AI/work. I think copyright should only apply to humans because their names, their livelihoods, and their futures are attached to the work they put out. You cannot say the same for AI generated things; there is no name attached to it. Yes, someone might have gone into a website and created something With AI, but it is not their work because it didn&rsquo;t come 100% from them. They were not the ones who created it, something artificial did. If that person created said outcome by themselves, then copyright makes sense because it takes into account the time and effort put into their work. There is no time and effort associated with AI and it&rsquo;s generated products. If AI generations receive copyright, it would be a war zone and nightmare for access to property, ownership, and such. For these reasons, I&rsquo;m against AI receiving copyright.
