As a composer of music with degrees from The Peabody Institute and Duke University and having been recognized by the American Academy of Arts and Letters for my work I think I am uniquely qualified to speak to this issue.  Protecting the ownership of work that spawns from innate human creative expression in order to encourage further expression is the central goal of copyright law.  AI as it currently exists doesn&#39;t create work, it regurgitates the work it has been trained as if viewed through a fun house mirror. At best this qualifies as a derivative work and at worst outright plagiarism. Tech companies would have you believe they are the vulnerable ones here but that is false.  Artists are and have always been at risk of theft and exploitation.  It is the responsibility of this government to set a precedent that no matter the purpose the stealing of creative work for commercial business purposes is unacceptable in our society.
