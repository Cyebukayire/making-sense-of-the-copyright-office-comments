I believe that copyright for AI-generated content using software and other programs should be considered similar to photography. The process for both shares many similarities, from planning (prompting), to composition, and post-editing. While some may think that creating AI-generated content requires no skill and that results from using it &quot;steal from other art-pieces&quot; due to using content in the training data during its learning phase, I would fundamentally argue that it takes as much as skill as taking a photograph would, and that it learning to create art is not dissimilar from artists traditionally studying art pieces to learn varying art styles and techniques.<br/>While the AI-generated content has a lower point of entry to creating content compared to the technical skill required for good quality painting, drawings, writing, or other media, every result ultimately was due to a prompt that was arranged and initiated by a human user. AI-generation should be considered a tool to be used in the same vein as a camera or photo-editing software. Just as a camera manufacturer, brush maker, or Photoshop itself doesn&#39;t have a copyright claim on content created using them, I believe that copyright using AI-generation techniques and software should be treated the same.
