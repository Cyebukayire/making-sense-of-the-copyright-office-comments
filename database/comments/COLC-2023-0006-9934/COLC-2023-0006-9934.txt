Machine learning is a form of learning, and as such should not infringe copyright in the training process any more than a human learning by seeing would. Let us not become overzealous and in doing so label learning itself as theft. While the scale of machine learning makes it unique, the benefits provided to the public in the form of generative AI as well as scientific applications are considerations worth making.<br/><br/>Democratized access to generative AI will empower far more people to produce their visions and contribute to both art and economic productivity than it shall disincentivize. This is an important consideration for copyright precedent -- the goal of copyright is to incentivize creators, not to erect barriers. Generative AI will on net accomplish this goal by lowering barriers to entry and democratizing entire industries.<br/><br/>The raw outputs of generative models are not the product of any specific person or entities intentional creativity, therefore these should not be directly copyrightable. Raw outputs should by default be considered public domain.<br/><br/>Prompts should not be copyrightable for obvious reasons. Nobody wants a well-resourced corporation programmatically generating a quintillion prompts and claiming ownership over those prompts.<br/><br/>Outputs sufficiently modified by human input could be copyrightable if the alterations were significant, intentional, and meaningful. This would include even post-processing using AI tools given that the use of such tools involved significant and uniquely impactful intentionality by the person or people involved.<br/><br/>AI model weights&#39; protection as intellectual property should be defined relative to the amount of public data used, and to the public good provided. In other words, the weights of models primarily built upon public domain data should themselves be considered public domain.
