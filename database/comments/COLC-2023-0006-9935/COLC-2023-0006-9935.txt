AI art should not have any form of copyright protection, as it is inherently based on the works of others edited by a non-human entity. It is the same as rolling a dice and claiming the number is your own work, ignoring that you had little to no true input compared to the vast amount of possibilities within the system. <br/>At the same time, AI art should not be subject to any form of restraint or be treated as violating copyright laws, unless such art is obviously a direct copy of a copyrighted work. The lines between what is legal and not become far too blurry when there is no direct artists, and as AI art improves it will become impossible to tell it and normal art apart. False positives and intentional mistakes will be rampant, given that both sides have a vested interest against the other.<br/><br/>Treat all AI generated art, prompted or not, edited or not, as the creation of a random system without direct human input. You can not copyright it, but it can not be limited legal. Companies are already limiting its use, so no government intervention is required.<br/>If AI tools are limited by law, then those countries that do not limit its use will vastly overtake us. AI generation is a powerful tool, and holding ourselves back from its use will be a death sentence for our advancement in terms of technology, art, and other fields not yet touched by generative AI.<br/>Let it sort itself out, simply prevent its use from harming those who would create art by hand,
