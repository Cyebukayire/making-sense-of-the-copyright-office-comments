Every artist has been inspired by reading, viewing, and listening to art. I believe that copyright is infringed at the time of sale, not consumption. I believe I should have the right to look at, listen to, or examine anything in my own physical possession. I believe this right includes the atomic configuration of my harddisks, I believe that they are mine to examine or change for as long as they remain in my possession.
