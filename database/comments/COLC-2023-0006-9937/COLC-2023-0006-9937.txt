Good Morning<br/>Before getting too far in creating policy that can punish/deter advancement, we need to look at things through clear lenses.  In the arena of copyright, copyright is supposed to protect the creator from someone else &#39;stealing&#39; their effort and reaping gain.  There have been many challenges to this, sometimes even misunderstandings and lawsuits have happened.<br/>In the AI arena, Deep Learning is still truly in the &#39;fill in the blank&#39;/&#39;best guess&#39; stage, just with the growing number of calculations in the smallest time interval taking place.  In a sense, going back a year, working with Generative AI for imagery involved a lot of internet &#39;scraping&#39;, but for those of us who kept trying to produce productions utilizing as much &#39;creativity/interpretation&#39; from the machine side possible, we are getting somewhere.  <br/>In producing my current project: ORDER OF THE ORCHID, it has been challenging to produce a multi character full animation since it isn&#39;t as simple as copy/paste.  At the same time, in no way have I based any of the imagery on a camera shot of someone in my neighborhood and/or on social media.  In fact, I have a few shots of my character Lex who resembles a former First Lady which I&#39;ve kept as an example to show someone who might inquire.  Otherwise, I&#39;ve attached a few shots of the more comic book version (this format doesn&#39;t allow video) where there are a lot of &#39;pages&#39; crammed on to each frame.  Episodes 1 and 2 now total over 8 minutes in video.<br/>Generative AI allows me to produce image, turn image into slight animated movement, add audio and put together a production as I did back when during my time in media.  Though some of the art may appear sloppy, that is because I&#39;m trying to stay in a neutral place gaining from the person&gt;prompt&gt;program possible and then weave together while you still work the day job.<br/>Since I come from the arena of music (Bachelor Music Performance/Classical Guitar), I do believe in the importance of copyright, yet am realistic about ramifications and reality.  There will be those who steal and the end of the line creator needs to understand that will happen.  Saying artwork produced by AI is bad will not get us anywhere and simultaneously, we need to communicate to folks that when they post/share something online, it is being disseminated into DATA of some sort.  We need to protect everyone in the arena where the big companies doing anything to aquire DATA related to social/medical/financial et.al. is as dangerous as the &#39;bash AI&#39; fad.<br/>Thank you for your time.<br/>David W.
