AI companies are making billions of dollars pilfering copyrighted material without permission and without providing any compensation back to the original copyright holder. They are not public benefit non profits. They do this to enrich their own owners and shareholders. They should have to follow the rights and desires of the original copyright owners of the data they train on. Further, the results of their algorithms cannot be copyrighted as no human created the results.
