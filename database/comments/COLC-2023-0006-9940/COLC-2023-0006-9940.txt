When someone uses my images without my permission to &quot;train&quot; their software to blend those images into new images and then sells that &quot;trained&quot; software and/or images, that is copyright infringement. At the very least my permission should be obtained before any of my work is used to train AI. AI images are in direct competition with artists and photographers and those artists and photographers should be compensated for their work.<br/>
