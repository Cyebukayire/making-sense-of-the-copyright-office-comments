I think you should seriously consider UBI for music creators as it seems like AI is going to replace a large swath of the music creators, for worse. If music is really a public good, it should be in the US govt best interest to make sure music creators can at least survive. Sadly this is seldom the case just in general aside the 1% pop stars. Part of that is consent decree, US govt legislation price capping mechanicals etc - the laws themselves harm music creators as is. <br/><br/>All the music laws need to be re-worked in general not just in terms of AI. UBI for artists is long over due in general. Maybe AI will be the final straw and the US will start taking care of artists like most other first world countries that value the cultural benefit of music.
