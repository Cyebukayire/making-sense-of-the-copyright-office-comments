As a music maker, I appreciate the Copyright Office&#39;s Notice of Inquiry on generative artificial intelligence and copyright, and I urge the office to incorporate the perspective of artists, songwriters, producers and other individual creative workers. The work you are undertaking will influence generations of creators, and safeguarding human creativity must remain the foundation of any future rule or regulation. <br/> <br/>Generative AI is a technology with the potential to expand the universe of who can create music. Does it make creativity more accessible? It depends how you define creativity. As a tool and instrument, it can be useful in generating ideas.  But generative AI should not be left unchecked to displace or eliminate human creativity. The Copyright Office must protect human creators. <br/> <br/>As you look to develop new rules and regulations governing generative AI, I urge you to crackdown against the widespread misuse and theft of copyrighted works to train AI models and systems. Music makers, particularly independent creators, are powerless to prevent their copyrighted creations from being ingested without consent or compensation.   <br/> <br/>I also urge you to reinforce the principles of copyright law that are designed to incentivize human creativity and help ensure that not only outputs from generative AI models do not infringe on existing copyrighted materials, but also not replace them. No human should have to compete against a technology infringing their own work to displace them from the market. AI as a tool, an interesting concept, as a generator of creativity will not have <br/>the human unpredictable emotional touch and variation. Let&#39;s not forget that not everyone dreams of having what they do replaced by automation, there are those of us who enjoy what we do. And our contributions need to be protected.<br/>Thank you for taking the time to listen to the creators and working professionals most impacted by generative AI.
