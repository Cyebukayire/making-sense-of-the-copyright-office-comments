Duarte, Cesare - Architect<br/><br/>So after reading the responses of the AI companies on how copyright should work, I feel that they sound at the very least amusing, these are the same companies that will argue that installing your bought software on two machines is stealing from them, the same companies that say you can&#39;t screenshot a video you paid for, the same ones that will go after you with all the lawyers if you monetize their data, these same companies now want to argue that our private data and works, faces, voices, likeness, writings, paintings, illustrations are fair use and theirs to take and monetize how they see fit.<br/><br/>Under current legal framework this is theft, cut and dry, and cry me a river when companies say they invested billions on AI that reproduces expressive content, therefore they should be allowed to do it not to slow down the development of AI, for decades these same companies abused copyright going after individuals and smaller companies, and now all of sudden &quot;data needs to be free&quot;, the proposed is such an unbalanced and unfair application of copyright principles that they should be laughted out of any serious room, in their proposal, copyright will be granted for their own property, models, software, codebase and trademarks, but the creative expression of any taxpayer is now fair use if it&#39;s &quot;freely avaliable&quot; (notice the language used, there is no such a thing) on the internet.<br/><br/>Freely avaliable became synonymous with fair use for them.<br/><br/>AI is not profitable, the costs of operation and maintenance are massive, the companies can&#39;t get users to pay for a monthly fee that makes it profitable, so they need to extract value from somewhere, this somewhere is the extraction of economic value from the extremally valuable creative expression of professional works in copyrighted data, each work a sum of decades of experience, expertise, training, investment in education and equipment, made by creatives and entertainment industries, all that value and work used for building machine learning software for profit of these companies, none of it goes to the original creators, not even consent to use the works is being asked for.<br/><br/>The revelation that this new AI industry is a pyramid scheme comes from the training data argument, all data could have been trained on public domain works, of which there is no shortage of, however, public domain works have the massive economic value that could potentially make AI profitable, and clearly paying for it would cost tens of billions, turning the entire AI industry redundant, an industry that is built on theft and on the abuse of consent and property should not be tolerated or allowed to thrive, if AI companies can&#39;t secure rightsowners permission and consent to use their creative and personal works for profit, they don&#39;t deserve to exist in the market at all, after all, money can be exchanged for products and services, AI companies simply want their infinite pool of feedstock to generate economic value for their software without paying the owners a dime, the proposed by them it&#39;s not a legitimate business model at all.<br/><br/>They want the creative industry, and it&#39;s individuals to do all the investing in creating the content, the training, the preparation, the years of practice, only for them to reap the economic benefits, it&#39;s a parasitic relationship, one that will quickly kill the creative sectors for the massive asymmetry of resources, rights and privileges being asked for, while the creative industry is bound by copyright to do all the hard work, sweat and blood to create content, AI industries are free to take all of that and monetize it, this is what they want years after protecting their own copyrights aggressively, it&#39;s worse than parasitism, as wages and jobs swindle on the content creation side, all profits will be siphoned to tech giants, it&#39;s slavery.<br/><br/>the FTC and the USCO have the obligation to make sure that the rights and resources of the creative industry are preserved, training AI on highly expressive and creative works, for commercial use, severely damaging the original market value by flooding it with reproductions, without consent, credit or compensation is extremally excessive, abusive, unfair in competition, unbalanced, and that protection should never ever, ever be granted.<br/><br/>The proposed imbalance in the distribution of value and revenue of the two industries create a one-way street, the tech industry wants to benefit from using the copyrighted works of the creative industry without paying royalties, fees or licenses, creating a massive imbalance in the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights between the two, asking for a broad, extremally privileged, biased, unprecedented exception on law for the benefit of five or six companies, an exception that no-one else is allowed to enjoy.<br/><br/>Generative AI with copyrighted stolen data is not a legitimate business and we taxpayers won&#39;t subside it&#39;s existence at our own expense.<br/><br/>
