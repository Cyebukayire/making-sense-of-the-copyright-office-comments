While ai art has never been more than a hobby of mine, I believe ai art is best left alone. I have never been able to draw a straight line as my hands won&rsquo;t allow it, and while in a time of rising prices and myself going to flight school, every dollar I don&rsquo;t spend on paying someone else to draw something specific counts. The only arguments I&rsquo;ve seen for ai are being bad are that it &ldquo;steals&rdquo; from other artists works, but how is that any different from an artists taking inspiration? Everyone does it, they see an element they like about a piece and take it to make their own. This is how humans learn, how they improve. Not to mention this is a discussion of technology not exclusive to the US. If ai is restricted here, there&rsquo;s no guarantee it will be restricted elsewhere, either giving foreign users an edge or indirectly forcing US users of ai art to find workarounds. I believe in its current state ai will never match the skills of a great artist, but it can be an affordable inspiration for everyone and it&rsquo;s imperative to realize this is a technology not exclusive to the US.
