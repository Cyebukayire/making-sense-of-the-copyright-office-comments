I, personally, believe that AI art (while as controversial as some models are) is a step in the right direction for the future of artificial intelligence as well as the internet. For people with me, who lack the time needed to properly learn to draw nor the expendable income to have others draw for me, it serves as an easy to access and overall wonderful alternative to being stuck between a rock and a hard place. While there may need to be precautions taken, such as asking for permission to train a model on someone&#39;s art (to prevent a case of art theft or something of the sort), I do not think that AI Art should be removed from the Internet entirely.
