I believe AI models should not be allowed to be trained on copyrighted art without artist&#39;s permission, firstly because these models are used to generate art that supporters of the technology claim as their own art, and secondly because I have seen countless examples of AI art generated by using an artist&#39;s name in the prompt in an attempt to emulate their style. This is both unethical and wrong when done without the artist&#39;s explicit permission, which has already happened so many times as the field of AI art is so new and unregulated.<br/><br/>I am also of the opinion that AI art should not be copyrightable in general. Supporters of AI art will claim that AI models are merely a tool, and as such creations should be subject to copyright law, however, AI models take extremely minimal human input, basic parameters and commands are given, but the overwhelming majority of the work is done by the training data contained within the model, thus, unless the model was trained by an artist with their own work, one cannot claim the art generated by an AI model is an accurate representation of the creator&#39;s work.<br/><br/>Finally, using AI to mimic other artist&#39;s styles should be illegal unless the artist being imitated gives explicit, legally binding permission. Additionally, individuals already have a right to their own voice and likeness, why should art be any different? Artists who allow art to be generated in their style should have rights to ensure they&#39;re compensated when their style is generated and used in any way. Additionally, when done without permission, using an AI model to mimic another artist&#39;s style should be treated no differently than fraud or identity theft as it is a transparent attempt to trick others to gain financial or social benefits.
