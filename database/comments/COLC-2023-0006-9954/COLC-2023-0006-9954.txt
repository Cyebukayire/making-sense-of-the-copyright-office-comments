No one should be able to profit off of others work without permission and payment. The LLMs have stolen millions of works wholesale with no attempt at consent, attribution, or compensation. This applies to copyrighted works such as books, websites, blogs, articles, movies, music, etc. I also believe this applies to non-copyrighted content such as public comments, forum posts, etc. regardless of the Terms of Service of the entity hosting such content.
