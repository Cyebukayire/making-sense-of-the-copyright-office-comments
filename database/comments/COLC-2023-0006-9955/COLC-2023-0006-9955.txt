I am a longtime managing editor at a magazine covering New York politics. As such, I collaborated with artists on a daily basis to produce editorial and satirical content, and frequently consulted with media lawyers to assess fair-use cases to ensure that we did not run afoul of copyright laws. <br/><br/>AI companies sourcing copyrighted content without compensation clearly violates the spirit of U.S. copyright laws.<br/><br/>As you are well aware, &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; allows new works based on pre-existing works only if they are &ldquo;transformative&rdquo; -- as your own website states, &ldquo;those that add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work.&rdquo; So if I were to, say, recreate Edward Hopper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nighthawks&rdquo; using the faces of Donald Trump and Joe Biden for satirical purposes, that would most likely be allowed under fair use, since so reasonable person would purchase that work to display in their place of business as a substitute for the real &ldquo;Nighthawks,&rdquo; depriving the Hopper estate of profits.<br/><br/>AI-created art, meanwhile, is explicitly already using copyrighted works to &ldquo;substitute for the original use of the work.&rdquo; AI image generators trained on artists&rsquo; works allow the user to indicate a specific artist by name, and use that artist&rsquo;s own work to create a substitute for their work, denying them the commission they would have otherwise made. <br/><br/>This is not conjecture. My artist colleagues are already losing their commissions and their livelihoods because major companies are substituting images based, in part, on their own published work to forge promotional materials, book illustrations, and other media. <br/><br/>The Copyright Office was specifically created to stop bad actors from profiting off other people&rsquo;s creations without compensation. It would be unconscionable for the Office to be intimidated into abandoning its mission now.
