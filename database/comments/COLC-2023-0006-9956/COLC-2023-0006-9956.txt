Training AI on previous art doesn&#39;t seem like it really is stealing. It is taking the image and turning it into reference points to show what goes together and it uses tags to show their relationship with terms and ideas that humans categorize things in. AI is an aid to humanity and I would prefer the United States to be on the cutting edge of these developments. I understand content creators will be affected by this change but everyone will be affected by it. It seems AI art is getting the most comments but whenever AI writing tools came out they did not get nearly the same amount of responses that visual art did. AI is good for creative types and those without the skill the make their ideas come true. That opens up art to more than just the people that have the opportunity to learn the skills.
