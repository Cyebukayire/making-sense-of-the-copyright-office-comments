If a complaint were taken to court about a well-known registered trademark, it would be given full merit.  Since every author&#39;s and artist&#39;s work is known by that author&#39;s name or pen name, that effectively becomes their trademark.  Authors&#39; and artists&#39; names are common inputs for AI, resulting in stories and images with the authors&#39; and artists&#39; style or look and feel respectively.  They are derivative works.  Since the author or artist holds the copyright, this should not be permitted.  Historically, McDonalds and Susan G. Kohman For the Cure have sued for violations of their trademarks, or their look and feel.  AI is appropriating American intellectual property and has been for at least a year.  <br/><br/>And the Copyright Office has failed utterly to protect Americans&#39; intellectual property.  <br/><br/>Does the US Patent and Trademark Office suffer the same defect?  Arguably, yes.  <br/><br/>More importantly than whether AI works should be copyrightable, ask whether the Copyright Office is capable of enforcing copyrights.  Ask whether the US courts can bear the burden of lawsuits filed against AI prompt writers and AI scraping software data aggregators.  <br/><br/>Authors and artists need definition.  Can we sue?  Can we expect the US Copyright Office to support our copyrights?  If not, why should our taxes be spent paying your salaries?
