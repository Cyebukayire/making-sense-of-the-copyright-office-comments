As much as the current status quo draws the ire of artists and other copyright-owners, we must acknowledge the reality that it is fruitless to stand in the way of technological progress. Once the cat has been let out of the bag, once the genie has been allowed to fly out of the bottle... it just cannot be rolled back. We can not lock the genie back into the bottle.<br/>Artificial intelligence is here, and it is not going away any time soon. Attempts to regulate it away are fruitless, as it exists in an open-source marketplace with open source solutions. Any attempts to meaningfully regulate it would require essentially killing the open source programming scene, and the consequences of that would be extremely harmful to everyone, including the artists protesting against the existence of AI art.<br/>AI must be protected. The freedom to discover new hights that artificial intelligence can go to must be protected. AI art must remain copyright-free.
