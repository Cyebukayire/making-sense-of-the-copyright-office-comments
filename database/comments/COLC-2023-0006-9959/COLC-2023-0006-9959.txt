I&rsquo;ve been a digital artist for over twenty years. AI Art programs are simply advanced tools.  Like most advanced tools it&rsquo;s as helpful to hacks as it is true artists. AI Art programs do not copy pictures or other artists&rsquo; work to produce art. It&rsquo;s influence by other work just human artists. You can also do much than this throw in a prompt with it. AI Art programs also require human input and control. The concept belongs to the person not the program.
