I want AI models to be able to view and learn from anything and everything. To say that a machine is not allowed to view and learn from publicly available media, when any human alive today can do just that without question, is wrong. And that&#39;s beside the point that there seems to be widespread misunderstanding of how these systems operate.<br/><br/>They are not taking exact replicas of existing works and mishmashing them together. Specifically, for image-generating AI, they are observing and &quot;learning&quot; in a fairly human sense of the word. It observes an image, and is told what the image contains, either as a whole or in its constituent elements, or what concepts the image is an example of, etc. It then slightly adjusts its internal understanding of concepts (weights in the neural network) based on this new information, then discards the image and moves on to the next one. It does this over and over again with new images until the people creating it feel that it has a firm understanding of concepts.<br/><br/>This is not plagiarism or copyright violation, in my opinion. Any human is entitled to view media and learn from it. Artificial intelligence should be too.<br/><br/>If we&#39;re talking about the copyright of images created by the AI when a human prompting it requests imagery of copyrighted characters, that goes into a can of worms regarding the legality of fan artwork in general and/or people commissioning private artists for artwork of copyrighted characters, and should, in my opinion, be treated similarly. It should be looked the other way from in cases where the created artwork is not thereafter used in a way that violates copyright.
