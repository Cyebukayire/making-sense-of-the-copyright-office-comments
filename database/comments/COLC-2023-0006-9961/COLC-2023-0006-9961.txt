Maybe we should give AI protections under the copyright act because it could prove useful to hold accountable those who created them to infringe on others&#39; copyrights. Similar to the UK and New Zealand laws on AI copyright protections are limited for 50 years. AI is coming and Congress is itching to extend copyright another 20 years maybe 100 years. If we don&#39;t do this for AI then likely copyright will be in perpetuity or like 1000-year terms if they don&#39;t get their way they&#39;ll make our lives miserable.
