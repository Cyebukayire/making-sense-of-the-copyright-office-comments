Artificial Intelligence generated artwork is a beautiful advancement in the fields of computer science, art, and civics as it opens a gateway to creating art to users who are not practiced/or gifted in that field. The generated artwork has a place in our society in the same way that other artworks of all different media do. These advancements do not serve to replace human art and design but rather offer a fantastic buffer for enthusiasts who appreciate the technology and processes required for this type of work.
