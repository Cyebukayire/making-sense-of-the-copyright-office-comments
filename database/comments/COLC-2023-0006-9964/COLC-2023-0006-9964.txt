While I do think that Artificial Intelligence has positive and interesting applications, I have been more distraught in it&#39;s also greatly destructive capabilities.<br/><br/>For starters things like Dall-E and Stable Diffusion began on the completely wrong foot, with using vast unauthorized artworks, and then turning around and trying to spin as the artists&#39; problem, not their own dishonorable tactics. Even now it&#39;s incredibly involved and time-consuming for an artist to protect their work from being used for AI, with limited options like the Glaze system still being a work in process and not 100% foolproof for future systems.<br/>Email and telephone scammers now also incredible capabilities with these tools to achieve more realism when trying to persuade victims.<br/><br/>Ted Chang has famously been quoted as the real fear about AI is the fear of capitalism- and I generally agree with that to a point. However the disinformation capabilities are now quite alarming if not properly checked. With capabilities such as realistic voice cloning and deepfakes now somewhat mainstream to access, and given the last 9 years of political tension, I do not find the American population capable of handling the nuance and critical thinking required to determined reality from Artificial Intelligence generated reality. To our credit, it is very easy to many things for granted on the internet sometimes- and I suspect we are (hopefully?) about to enter a period of having to second guess many things we see.<br/><br/>I haven&#39;t even dove into the great philosophical topic of if AI is used to generate art, is it the person pressing the button that is the artist, or is it the AI itself? (I generally favor the latter). However I do know in the last 10 years it has been an incredible struggle for artists to make a living, having to combat regularly things like people taking their artwork illegally and slapping it on t-shirts, making illegal prints, etc. And now having to deal with people outright telling them to their face they can now take their very essence, their artistic style, and make it generate whatever, is outright existential horror. It has been an incredibly depressing year for artists, and it is difficult to put our faith in our capitalistic society that has been so tremendously slow to re-act to any of this. <br/>
