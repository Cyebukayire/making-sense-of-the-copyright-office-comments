AI Art is art, I do not think it should be banned and I think we should be able to copywrite our work. It is not easy to do and if you not directly copy someone&#39;s work who is it hurting?  Many local bands cover famous bands and musicians and they don&#39;t get shut down, they venues don&#39;t get shut down and those artists make money. Comedians get their jokes stolen from Corporations and other comedians. If the art has not been created yet, it is not stealing, that is like saying using a note from a piano is stealing. Yes the note is there, but using it in a different song is not stealing.
