I consider that the same way the photograph is having a copyright for the extensive work that a photographer does, the same way should be done for a part or copy of a photography in any manner should apply the loss for the copyright including the intellectual property of a photographer that includes any part of the photography including clone replicate multiplay should be taking inconstitucionation with using s photograph are strugging to make art it&#39;s for the machine to create this magical pictures created by a machine it takes all the art away of the human beings that is no photography I think it&#39;s that&#39;s more like Frankenstein it looks nice but it&#39;s not alive it&#39;s not a memory it&#39;s just a machine where is the humanity in that!
