I understand your fear of AI and AI art. But there is a bright side; AI art is a way of expression; the AI itself is unaware and can&#39;t take credit for one&#39;s work. With AI, it helped my work ethic and my writing speed. It shortens the brainstorming process so I can write quickly and get my ideas on paper. It also allows me to explore other avenues in my writing, offering plot twists and guiding my stories in new directions.
