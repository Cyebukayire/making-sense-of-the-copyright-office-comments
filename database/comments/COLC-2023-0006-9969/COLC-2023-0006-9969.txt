Much like photographers own their photographs despite a machine being a crucial and central part of the process, so should people using AI techniques own the output they generate using said AI. Placing AI on the same footing as photographs has the further implication that mimicking someone&#39;s likeness using AI without their permission should be problematic for example. The quality of the output can greatly vary based on the skill and creativity of the user, as well as the hardware they have access to. So in the same way that a novice can point and click a camera, but still have copyright over the output, so should an individual using AI.
