As an artist and designer I have increasing concerns about the usage of my works and the works of my peers without my consent, something I have already seen happen through programs such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. There should be a transparency policy that has developers cite the sources that the models were trained on, as well as proof those sources gave their consent to have their work used in these models.If they cannot prove they respected copyrights and trademarks to make their models, then any product should logically be ineligible for a copyright in itself. AI generated media, bereft of any regulations or guardrails prove only to pollute our information and resources, both visual and textual, while taking jobs away from qualified and well educated human beings.
