Hello, I am an individual. I use AI art both as a hobby and as a way to supplement my own creative ventures. I personally find no fault in AI so long as it is used responsibly. While AI has the capability of being used to steal other people&#39;s styles without their permission the very act of using another person&#39;s style for the longest time has been accepted, even if looked down upon. Comedians using each other&#39;s comedy timing, singers doing covers, etc. in addition to that I find those desiring a ban of AI art because it has the capability of being used wrong is like saying that power tools should be banned because someone could use it to severely hurt other people. Perhaps some regulations may be in order to prevent to protect creators when that occurs but in the vast majority of cases most people who use AI art are using it as a tool to supplement other creative ventures rather than just wholesale stealing art to make themselves feel accomplished. <br/>Thank you for taking my opinion into consideration ^.^
