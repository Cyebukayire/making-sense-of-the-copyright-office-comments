AI regulations would only aid in the enclosure and eventual extreme enshittification of AI tools. The only reasonable AI regulation in a world where military AI will inevitably outpace any other AI sphere is one which actively seeks to prevent corporation ownership (and thus an inevitable monopolization), rather than aiming to regulate things such as compute (which isn&rsquo;t a necessity for further AI improvement) or ability (which depends on whom defines &ldquo;ability,&rdquo; something which will be determined in the favor of corporations and against the favor of open source/collectively-computed models, via the inevitable lobbying of corporations to create such a scenario whenever and wherever possible).
