I&#39;m a writer and editor, I work for various literary magazines and freelance edit. As well, I work with those organizations to get my own work published. The issue of AI writing and art is annoying to say the least. While it strips art and words of the human emotions that make them worthwhile, it also steals from creative people. People using AI generated text are trying to force their way into creative spaces without doing the work of actually creating, and instead lifting from the styles they love. These so-called writers try to pass off their stories and poems as genuine which takes the place where an authentic writer could gain exposure. AI threatens my livelihood and my craft because it&#39;s causing writing jobs to become scarce and much of copy-write material, image descriptions, technical writing, and even published novels to worse in quality. AI generated content is greedy and lazy because in order to produce something, it must take from somewhere else. Multiple chatbots have been caught lifting work of authors who self-publish their writing in online communities.  If AI generated content weren&#39;t causing problems in creative communities, the people in these spaces wouldn&#39;t be up in arms or even striking over it, but here we are. It&#39;s unethical to let it create something by stealing from others, it&#39;s unethical to let it steal people&#39;s passions in a world that is ruled by work. Passions like writing, art, and music are the few things humanity has left that lets us express ourselves and escape from our lives of work.
