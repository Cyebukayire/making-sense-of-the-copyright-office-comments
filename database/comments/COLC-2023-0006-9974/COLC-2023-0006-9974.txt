Objects produced by so-called &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; (be they visual or textual) should not be protected by copyright for two reasons. 1) They are not the product of a human being with rights to protect. 2) They are produced using algorithms that are trained on works that often have been taken without the consent of their creators, essentially making them products of plagiarism.
