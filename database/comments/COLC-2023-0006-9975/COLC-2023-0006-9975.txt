AI used to generate artwork, written work, and even mimicry of voices is unethical because of how it obtains the data it uses as well as what it can be used for. It often rips the work of creators without their consent. The use of AI would lead to a spiral of lower quality work in mass quantities, and should it get so severe, could even lead to mass Job termination. AI has also been seen being used to mimic real life people; meaning it can be used to make a recording of someone saying something they never have or wouldn&rsquo;t ever say.<br/><br/>AI collects mass amounts of data from creators without the creator&rsquo;s consent. This stolen data is then used to generate something based on a prompt. Why should AI be allowed to take the work of others without permission when even actual artists need permission to use images in techniques like photobashing. Why is AI being allowed to take so much in such a mass scale without consequence.
