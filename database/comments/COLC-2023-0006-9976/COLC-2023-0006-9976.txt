AI is theft. The powerful are scalping our images, art, conversations, and creativity to fund their profits. It&#39;s all theft. Every single AI is just stealing from real people, their real identities, their real words and stories in order to create cheap imitations and turn a dollar. I am livid. How DARE they. This is the reason the early settlers left England: because the powerful abused the powerless, and there was no where left to turn.
