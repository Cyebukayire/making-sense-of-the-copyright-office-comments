AI generation technology is without a doubt the future. Much like computers, cameras, cars, digital art, even printers - the people will take time to adjust, but in the end it will allow everyone to be far more productive. <br/><br/>AI generation - to my knowledge - works by understanding the structure of images, so if there is an x color pixel and the topic of the picture is a cat - the AI then estimates that based on the theme the next pixel most likely needs to be y color. It doesn&#39;t replicate existing images, it analyzes the patterns and calculates probabilities based on it&#39;s knowledge of art. Similar to a human, we use thousands of years of art evolution to draw modern day art<br/><br/>It&#39;s also important to remember that art style is not copyrightable - and that&#39;s necessary - because if it wasn&#39;t the case, major corporations would copyright every art style, and nobody would ever be allowed to draw again.<br/><br/>Regulating AI art is important, but it is in the best interest of the artists, that said regulations are lax. Because, again, major corporations will always be able to afford to use AI art, it&#39;s important that regulations do not make impossible for an individual to use it, while allowing the corporations to do so
