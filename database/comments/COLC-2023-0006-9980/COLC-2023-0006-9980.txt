AI techniques boil down to one of two approaches: 1. Optimisation search, 2. Categorisation.<br/><br/>An Optimisation search attempts to find a better solution to a given problem. Can we do it quicker, with fewer resources, make it stronger, more durable, etc... These kinds of searches often start with some input and add or subtract, or modify components that maintain the ability to solve the problem but improve one of these other qualities.<br/><br/>A Categorisation attempts to describe some input by defining how much it fits within a category. For example a picture of a bee might be categorised as &quot;Bee&quot;, but also &quot;Flower&quot;, and maybe &quot;Stripped&quot;.<br/><br/>Generative AI is simply running those two processes in reverse. Going from a solution back to a query that would naturally hold the answer. Or reverse a category back to some picture, sound, text, etc.. that would serve as an example of the category.<br/><br/>If I as a human wish to generate a picture or sound,etc.. i can draw on my wealth of knowledge and experiences to generate that content. The wealth of experiences may include copy-righted works. Those works I must have paid to obtain access to (by accepting advertising or paying in cash). But even then I do not have permission to reproduce that work without suitable amounts of modification, or a more permissive license.<br/><br/>We already have a standard for determining if I&#39;ve transformed the ideas I&#39;ve obtained from various sources, or if my work is pure rip off of another&#39;s work.<br/><br/>If there is a claim that an AI algorithm can produce Copyrightable work then it must be subjected to the Human Standard. Pay for access to the material. Pay more for a permissive redistribution license, or perform a significant amount of reformulation to make an independent work that stands up to the courtroom standard.
