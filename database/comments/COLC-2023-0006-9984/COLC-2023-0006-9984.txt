I argue to allow Artificial Intelligence for use to the general public and to allow copyright if a human is involved at least.<br/>Human authors and writers sample and borrow and even steal from everything we see, only fearing trademark and copyright infrigement legal and social penalties.  We can also plagarize without intent, especially in narrow fields.  The sci-fi and fantasy field have lots of issues of people coming up with the same ideas even with things that seem unlikely like secondary character names if the larger story is in a niche such as &quot;Alien Invasion&quot;.  This is because they are new fields, imagine if the same criticism was held to Fabio for appearing as a Gentleman Pirate on Romance novel covers among the many, many others in that genre?<br/><br/>AI is a new frontier of human enhancement and creativity.  It needs to be in the hands of the general public.  The elites and big companies and non-USA governance will not obey any laws you set and they already have too many advantages. <br/><br/>Myself I am a writer and storyteller and amateur artist.  These things make me thank God as I am very busy with many daily interruptions.  They do not write my stories for me - they help me organize.  They do not cost any artist I might hire their job, most illustrators have refused what I have asked for including things like detailed backgrounds.  Furthermore there seems to be a loose threat of a blacklist if artists help competition to big industries.<br/><br/>Please do not restrict AI for the public.  We despereately need this gift which was given to us.
