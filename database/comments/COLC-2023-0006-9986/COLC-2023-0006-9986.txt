Hello, <br/><br/>AI generated works should not be copyrightable.  The U.S. Copyright Office has made it clear to get a copyright, a human must have actually created the work.  By changing this rule, you open the door to situations where no person holds the copyright because a machine made the work.  A satirical slant on this was put out around the time of the &quot;monkey selfie&quot;: https://www.hrfmtoday.com/2014/10/copyrighting-ghost-stories.html<br/><br/>The monkey selfie itself is a great analogue to this decision.  A monkey learned how to take a selfie by watching a person do it, and then the monkey imitated it.  This is what AI currently does, take in what humans have done and copy it to make something.  The only difference between a monkey and AI is the AI was made by a person. <br/><br/>A counter to this is &quot;but Word and Photoshop are also made by a person, why is AI excluded when it is also a tool?&quot;  When someone creates a work using Word or Photoshop, they are actually creating the work.  The person still has to do everything.  They have to envision the work, put it into the program, and actively participate in creating the final product.<br/><br/>Some of these programs are implementing AI Assistance.  AI assistance is fine as long as it only assists.  It works with the artist to create the work but at a certain point where the assistant is the one creating then it falls back to not being a copyrightable work.  This will be a hard rule to come up with but I will suggest &quot;A person must take an active role in the creation of the work such that the work could not have been created without such person&quot;.  It is not great but it is something.  <br/><br/>Another issue for AI generated works is that the AI has to be trained on something.  The vast majority of this training material is scraped (aka stolen) from the internet. AI requires a lot of information to be able to be useful and many people have found chunks of their works in AI generated work. They wrote a story on AO3 or made a post on Deviant Art and then someone prompted an AI which spit out something with their prose or their watermark.  AI will eventually be made smart enough to avoid this, which raises issues of how does one make a claim against an AI generated work if the AI can hide the infringement. Will this require someone to claim copyright infringement for every work made by an AI if it was trained on their copyrighted works. This one issue can be avoided if someone has made enough works to train an AI on so they are not infringing on someone else&#39;s copyright but as of now that does not seem economical.  <br/><br/>I hope this is enough to show that AI generated works should not be given copyright protections.
