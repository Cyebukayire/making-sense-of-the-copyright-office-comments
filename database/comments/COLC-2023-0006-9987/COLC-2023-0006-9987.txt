1. As described above, generative AI systems have the ability to produce material that would be copyrightable if it were created by a human author. What are your views on the potential benefits and risks of this technology? How is the use of this technology currently affecting or likely to affect creators, copyright owners, technology developers, researchers, and the public? <br/><br/>Due to my limited personal knowledge of the subject, I have only started to learn about the ramifications of ai art for artists, independent, amateur and professional. It is my understanding that the various ai art programs which have been capturing the public&#39;s attention are built on a lot of material from various artists. No one was contacted or asked about their willingness to see their artwork be used as training data for ai programs. in fact, it may have been entirely impossible to seek the consent of enough artists to generate the training data needed for such programs. the developers scraped work from the internet and proceeded to develop their programs. As we have no way to determine whose work was utilized as training data, I believe it is irresponsible to give copyright protections to art or other works produced by ai. These works were developed in a manner entirely different than a human artist who might name other creators as individuals, or whose influences can be identified in their work.
