The databases built for A.I. Generated art come from billions of copyrighted imagery from companies and artists who did not consent to having their data used for commercial purposes. There are numerous mobile apps that are based off of Midjourney that create artistic filters in the style of working artists that have reaped massive profits in recent decades. A running theme off of these prompts are including the words &quot;Artstation, Trending on Artstation.&quot; Artstation is a website dedicated to empowering professionals to connect and showcase their work for better job prospects. These image generating networks are robbing professionals who&#39;ve poured years of their lives and livelihoods by siphoning nearly all works from the website. Worst yet are the A.I. users who are selling these amalgamated works as their own, or fraudulently selling works that are based of popular artists. Over the last year, I have seen many freelance opportunities for illustration evaporate due to the pervasiveness of this technology. As this technology gets better by the abundance of data and improving hardwares, there will be little opportunities left for creatives to make a meaningful career out of. Again a major part of this imminent displacement is fueled by stolen work, artworks that were not meant to be used as a part of a commercialized product, but for ensuring consistent job opportunities. There are numerous articles and testimonies that have pointed this out. This in turn will stifle human creative endeavors. I have attached screenshots in which users type in names of working artists to influence the outputs in Midjourney.
