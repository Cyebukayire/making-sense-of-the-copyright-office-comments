AI companies are taking artists work without their permission and profiting off of it without compensating them. It is theft. Technology allows them to do this at an absurd speed and scale, one that a human could not come anywhere near replicating. An AI does not learn the same way a human does. There is no good analogy there and any attempt to sell you one is disingenuous. Do not go to AI companies for explanations on why their use of artists&#39; work is fair -- they are profit-motivated and self-serving. If they weren&#39;t, they wouldn&#39;t be turning this tech into a product, but offering it as a free tool for everyone to use. Laws must be created to make this an opt-in system. Artists&#39; whose work has already been ingested should be given a verifiable way to confirm that their work is not being used by a company for profit.
