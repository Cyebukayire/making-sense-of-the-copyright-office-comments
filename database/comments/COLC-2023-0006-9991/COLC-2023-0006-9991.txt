As an individual who lacks traditional artistic talents but possesses a wealth of creative ideas, I am writing to express my appreciation for the role that artificial intelligence (AI) has played in enabling me to express my creativity and contribute to the world. I would like to emphasize the importance of maintaining an approach to copyright law that strongly supports the fair use of copyrighted data by AI companies, allowing individuals like myself to continue benefiting from AI&#39;s creative capabilities.<br/>By ensuring that AI companies can access and use copyrighted data for training their models without undue restrictions, we can foster innovation and progress in AI technology. This, in turn, enables people with diverse creative ideas but limited artistic skills to bring their visions to life through AI-generated content. I urge the Copyright Office to consider the positive impact that AI has had on enabling creative expression for individuals like myself and to adopt a policy stance that strongly supports the fair use of copyrighted data by AI companies. This will help to ensure that AI continues to serve as a valuable tool for creative expression and contribute to a more inclusive and diverse creative landscape.
