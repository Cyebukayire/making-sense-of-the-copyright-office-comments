Hello, good people. I must admit, I&#39;m not an american, however, I know that american law is widely considered a template and an example for others to follow. As such, I must ask you to do the right thing now. AI is a threat not only to all honest artists, but also to the human spirit itself. It is nothing but a collection of theft, lies, and undeserved rewards going to soulless corporations using the hard work of uncompensated people. Have we forgotten how this machines were trained? With real art, of course, proving it will always be necessary to nurture people&#39;s hearts. If morals will not convince you, let pragmatism do so: the use of AI opens a can of worms that nobody wants to deal with. Protected works are being used without the owner&#39;s consents to generate commercial material, opening the door to thousands upon thousands of lawsuits. Is that worth it? Whatever money is made will eventually be lost when the established laws prevail.  We must be on the right side of history, on the side that defended people&#39;s rights to create and be compensated for their hard work, rather than the explotation of greedy corporations that will never understand the true meaning of art.
