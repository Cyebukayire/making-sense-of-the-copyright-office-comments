I am both an artist and a scientific researcher.<br/>The learning of AI from any content published in the public domain on the internet should have the same freedoms as humans, as the principles of learning are largely the same for both. Regardless of the differences in detail, it does not involve plagiarism at least.<br/>Both AI and humans need to learn works by looking at copies. When a person opens content on the internet, they are actually viewing a copy in the cache. When the brain perceives the image of this work, it is also creating a copy of this image in the world model inside the brain, otherwise, it would be impossible to have access to the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;. Even if we take a step back and say that viewing copies is the unique and sole way AI learns, then special treatment should be provided, just as extra time is given in exams to students with ADHD.<br/>Humans do not possess any ontological superiority over AI; the differences lie merely in the specific algorithms. Attacks on AI often reflect back on humanity itself.<br/>Using AI does not suppress but rather encourages creation. AI has lowered the barriers to creation, allowing anyone to create with it and breaking the monopoly of artists on technique and discourse. Objectively, art cannot be classified as good or bad. Even if in the future some sense of quality is defined through neurobiology or other means, there is no reason to mandate that those &quot;bad&quot; works should not be produced.
