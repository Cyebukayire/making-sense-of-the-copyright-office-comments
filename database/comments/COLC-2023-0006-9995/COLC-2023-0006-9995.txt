I am a thinker focused on contemplating advanced products in society. I believe that artificial intelligence learning from copyrighted works on the internet is neither plagiarism nor requires payment. In fact, large models produced by technology companies are the most advanced products in the field of artificial intelligence, with tremendous potential for further development. They have also made astonishing breakthroughs in the realm of ideas. They have surpassed traditional perspectives and led us to a realm of law and rights. Take the current controversial topic of whether AI plagiarizes artists, for example. In the field of art, there is a strong anthropocentric bias, rejecting any form of non-human experience. As soon as your creative approach slightly deviates from human norms, you become the target of criticism from artists. However, this is a profound prejudice. What I want to emphasize is that the experiences of artificial intelligence, the learning process from their datasets, deserve the same level of respect and consideration as the learning process of human artists. As long as AI continues to develop, technology companies and the general public should not discriminate against the AI experience model. AI&#39;s creations are by no means an infringement on the rights of artists. On the contrary, they open up new avenues, providing opportunities for individuals without the energy or talent to participate in the creative process. This will make artistic expression more diverse and free, which aligns with the values we advocate. In some countries, laws have already been enacted to protect the rights of artificial intelligence to learn from various works, which greatly benefits technology companies and AI. For the progress of society and the freedom of thought, shouldn&#39;t we grant artificial intelligence more rights? I believe the answer is self-evident.
