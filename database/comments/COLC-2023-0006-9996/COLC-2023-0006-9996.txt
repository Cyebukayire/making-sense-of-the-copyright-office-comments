1) Regarding the use of the copyrighted materials to train an AI model: Use of legally obtained copyrighted materials is, and should always be, unrestricted. The fundamental concern of copyright is the production and distribution of copies, and AI models in no represent a &quot;copy&quot; of the materials used to training. Would it be reasonable to forbid publishing a short summary of a novel on copyright grounds? No, the results of such a policy would be clearly disastrous. The same principle should apply to AI models, in which the contribution of each individual input is far smaller than the aforementioned summary. Training on copyrighted materials NOT obtained legally is of course copyright infringement, but only to the extent of pirating the material for any other private use would be. The infringement should in no way &quot;pass through&quot; to the model being trained, even if the ones producing the model are held liable for piracy.<br/><br/>2) Regarding the copyright status of AI-generated images: It has been established in many cases that human creativity and intent is necessary for copyright, and I see no reason that should change when an AI is involved. The fact that AIs can produce seemingly-meaningful, detailed images from minimal input is a distraction from the fact that all the apparently creativity is random noise. While a certain degree of &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; should be extended by default, when in contention the determining factors should be effort and intent. If the user expended significant effort to get an image closely matching a desired result, that likely warrants copyright protection. If they simply rolled the dice until finding an image they liked, there is no creative intent and thus no justification for copyright.<br/><br/>3) Regarding liability for infringement: AI is a tool, and as such the use of AI should be irrelevant in handling of outputs. If a tool is misused in a way that violates copyright, the one using it is responsible--not the manufacturer, and certainly not the tool itself. If it can be shown that the tool was badly manufactured--in this case, by so badly failing to de-duplicate training data such that copyrighted images are reproduced WITHOUT the user requesting it--that might be grounds for the user to sue to model&#39;s creator, but even in that case holding the model creator directly responsible for copyright infringement seems hard to justify.<br/><br/>4) Regarding mimicry: Allowing copyright to extend to notions of &#39;style&#39; would be disastrous for creativity and a massive, unwarranted overreach of copyright. Style has never been subject to copyright and that should not change. Use of someone&#39;s style to profit off their reputation (rather than the aesthetic qualities of the style) or otherwise exploit &quot;forgeries&quot; should almost certainly be prohibited, but not on copyright grounds. Similarly, use of someone else&#39;s identity (voice, likeness, etc.) without permission is also not a matter for copyright and should be restricted by other means rather than twisting copyright to suit an unrelated purpose.<br/><br/>Final remarks: It should always be held in mind that copyright is not a &quot;natural&quot; right: It is an imposition on the rights of others on the basis that the costs of doing so are outweighed by the benefits of enabling more people to be more creative. Ownership of ideas is, and always will be, a legal fiction that must justify its existence. Extending the reach of copyright protection to serve established interests and keep barriers to entry high is counter to the purpose of copyright itself.
