My name is Ingrid Johnson. For the last two years I was the lead recruiter for Twitter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cortex&rdquo; organization. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>The purpose of this org was to find and utilize advancements in AI and Machine Learning, specifically around NLP (Natural Language Processing). <br/><br/> <br/><br/>I have been a tech recruiter in &ldquo;edge&rdquo; technology for the last ten years. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>What I have witnessed in Generative AI is extremely disturbing and should not be allowed to continue.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The process of &ldquo;web scraping&rdquo; does not have the ability to discern whether something is of public use or copywritten. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>And the businesses utilizing generative AI don&rsquo;t care who they steal from.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>We are at a tipping point that terrifies me. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>We CANNOT hand over 60,000 years of human thought, art, poetry, writing, research, and opinion to 50 dudes in Seattle and Silicon Valley. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>The global library of human thought is worth more than any company&rsquo;s bottom line. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>This large scale theft of our shared humanity is abhorrent and it&rsquo;s happening in broad daylight. This is the ego of these technologists.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I encourage your office to aggressively implement and police rules about copyright. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Before it&rsquo;s too late.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you and Best Regards,<br/><br/>Ingrid Johnson
