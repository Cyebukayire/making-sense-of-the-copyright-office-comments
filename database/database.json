                "comment": "In regards to training: a Generative AI is a program which processes images and outputs new images, and not a person who has spent time studying techniques. I think Generative AI is perfectly acceptable when it uses images in its dataset that it has had explicit, informed consent to use.<br/>Recently, the art website DeviantArt introduced an AI trained on images uploaded to their website, including images uploaded long before Generative AI was part of the public zeitgeist. DeviantArt has since reversed to an opt-in model after public backlash.<br/>While I think the opt-in model is much better, there remains an issue with this model; the ability for bad faith actors to reupload other people&#39;s art on small, unmonitored accounts to add otherwise nonconsenting artists&#39; work into a data set, presumably to create art in the style of artists.<br/>As such, I believe that before a Generative AI can be considered to have a non-infringing dataset, it must ensure that its entire dataset is curated, each artist being who they say they are and having made informed consent for their art to be used for training the AI.<br/><br/>As to whether AI Art should be copyrighted; I do not believe that art made whole-cloth of AI should be legally protected.<br/>Copyright, in theory, exists to protect artist&#39;s livelihoods, ensuring that they retain exclusive rights to print or chose who can reprint their art. With this control, an artist may sell their art knowing that no company can simply throw it on a shirt then have that shirt appear in stores across the nation.<br/>And if someone would attempt to put their art on a shirt illegally, they possess the ability to sue the infringing company.<br/>Writing a short prompt and having a program spit out artwork is not an artistic pursuit; it is an act akin to commissioning an artist. In an art commission, the commissioner is not the one who retains copyright; it is the artist. As a machine is not a human being who would need recompense, there is no value is granting it copyright.<br/>AI Artwork does have the potential to be used in a copyright protected work without spoiling the art. For instance, in an interactive digital novel the writer may chose to use AI to generate background art. Or, a movie making a large crowd scene might chose to generate these crowds digitally.<br/>In this regard, the composited scene should be protected by copyright while the individual assets, if obtained by another, should not be protected.<br/>As Generative AI grows in its ability to quickly produce accurate and customized art, reusing assets from other projects will likely be seen pastiche, and with the ease at which new art may be generated there is little reason to copy such work.<br/><br/>With regards to previous technological advances in productivity; a typewriter performs the act of &quot;writing letters&quot; while the words written on a page are of the author&#39;s own mind. One can not copyright the font one uses for a typewriter or on a digital text processor unless one designed the type themselves. Using Times New Roman does not give me copyright over Times New Roman.<br/>Generative AI is unique in its ability to entirely recreate works of art with no human input, though this is not entirely accurate. Just as the font I am writing this comment in was made by a human, so too is the &quot;font&quot; (dataset) the Generative AI used made by a human. However, while this comment was written by a human, the output of a Generative AI is not made by humans.<br/><br/>With regards to a prompt&#39;s copyrightability, I see no way in which a prompt cannot be considered human input. However, I do not believe the output of the prompt to be copyrightable.<br/>If a prompt would instead be posted as an open request on an art website, would that prompt be the copyright of the requester? If so, then the text of that prompt can protected by copyright. However, the resulting art would remain the copyright of the artists even if they based it on another user&#39;s text prompt.",

                "comment": "There is no intellectual effort involved in the creation of media by AI and so it should not be protected by copyright. However, there is intellectual effort involved in the creation of the AI itself, but I believe that to be irrelevant here.<br/>Another problem is that the AI uses human-made media for training. It is not the same as people drawing inspiration from other media, because humans perceive everything through their own lens and process everything in a meaningful way, while AI will simple take an input and turn it into an output via the algorithm created during training. Evidence of that is AI-generated &quot;fake&quot; signatures that often appear on AI-generated artworks. AI doesn&#39;t have any understanding or actual intelligence to know why these signatures are there or why anything is the way it is. And it is impossible to prove exactly what materials have been used, so people simply hide the fact that they take copyrighted materials. Thus, there is no use in trying to create licenses for training on certain media.<br/>Besides, copyright is meant to protect creations of people. Allowing media generated by means other than human mind to be protected by copyright would allow people to generate an endless stream of media and protect it by copyright for other reasons, ultimately not allowing actual people to create anything freely because everything would be too similar to things that were already generated. This seems unlikely now, but with the rapid growth of AI capabilities it might become possible.",

I am a young illustrator who works internationally as a freelancer.<br/>Thank you for the opportunity to express my opinion on ai.<br/>This year has been the hardest of all for me. I used to work on sites like fiver or artstation either through stock images or on twitter.<br/>Now it&#39;s very difficult for me to do this. The entire feed is spammed with ai generations, <br/>often people don&#39;t even write that the work was generated by ai.It is difficult for people to find my work among the constant stream of ai.<br/>All AI images were made from the work of other artists, including mine. I made $80 this month. I used to be able to make a living by<br/>painting...now my family advises me to take a job that was offered to me at the factory.<br/>I really love to draw but now I no longer have the opportunity to support my life like that.<br/>On sites like Pinterest and Google, photos are now filled with generated images, which is bad for the search process.<br/>I can no longer find what I was looking for. Many ai works that are currently being sold are sold using the names of the artists they <br/>stole from and uploaded to ai.I do not feel that my copyrights are protected, I feel that all my many years of work can simply be stolen<br/>and used against me in order to deprive me of my work.

                "comment": "As artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) reshapes creative production, debates intensify around the protection of works authored by or with AI (&ldquo;AI-generated works&rdquo;). The debate over whether to protect these works under the copyright system is a complex and ongoing discussion that raises significant legal, ethical, and practical considerations. The consensus is that works generated by or with AI are not protectable simply because copyright only protects the creative works of human authors. The current debate would then leave such works without protection. One issue this presents is disincentivizing the use of AI in the creation of books, art, or music. <br/>However, just as with human-created works, consumers can enjoy the art or prose of AI works, and thus these works have the same intrinsic value. Generally, the creation of value is a worthy societal and economic goal&mdash;hence the clause in the U.S. Constitution that refers to promoting &ldquo;the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo; <br/>In addition, the current consensus is undervaluing human inputs into AI-generated works that initiate and/or enable the work&rsquo;s creation. For example, if a human gives the AI a plot and writing style details and then tells the AI to write a short story, the resulting work is only created because of that human&rsquo;s inputs. Therefore, merely as a matter of equity and fairness, the human should be rewarded for initiating the AI-generated work, thereby creating value. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that copyright protection should apply in such a case. <br/>Indeed, it is this last point where we have been missing an opportunity. Debate in this area has been limited to the idea that there are only two possible outcomes, namely, copyright protection or no copyright protection. This article hopes to open the debate surrounding the intricate terrain of legal protection for AI-generated works by proposing a sui generis framework for such works. This framework, characterized by limited protection terms, well-defined rights, a registration requirement, a notice requirement, and a system providing a source of funds for public good, seeks to address the major obstacles to a way forward on solving the AI/copyright debate.<br/>",

                "comment": "Generative AI is showing to be a powerful tool, and can produce content at a pace and at a quality previously unimaginable. However, these generative AI tools have to be taught with data sets of other human&#39;s work, or else they have nothing to work off of or degrade by being fed other AI input. The first step for high quality and ethical AI tools is the informed consent of source material producers that their intellectual property and artistic labor is being used for AI training purposes. Without this consent these tools must die and be abandoned. The second is the operative intent of the AI tool. Is it being used as one component of a piece or is it the whole? A standard for human input of labor beyond the original prompt must be established in order to maintain quality of works and of artistic expressions. Third is informing the consumer. If a piece being produced to be consumed, the audience must be aware of the use of AI tools in its production. Without these criteria being met, the use of generative AI authors must not be allowed to be made equal to actual human authors",

                "comment": "Generative AI has a lot of problems. The more obvious is stealing private and copyrighted data to train these machines (something it is illegal and should be punished), then using the data to make convincing material like imitating real people and living artists&#39; works creating an unfair competition of humans vs machines while doing it for profit. I&#39;m worried AI will keep facilitating the replacement of human artistic labor or that it will devalue their work; like it&#39;s happening right now unregulated. People are forced to work more to just survive or in the worst case scenario force to just watch as creative careers disappear and these jobs are replaced by anyone without the knowledge or respect for the career.<br/><br/>Data privacy and copyright are a great issue. It&#39;s incredible how easy it was for AI companies to claim to be non-profit so they could get the training data from the whole internet and then be changed to for profit and releasing this kind of tech to the public without a single worry for the issues it could create on a global scale. I can only describe it as irresponsible and it can not be legal to do and it can not be left unpunished. Even if this software could be possible without stealing data, the mere nature of a machine that generates a lot of convincing content it&#39;s a problem and risk by itself. Problems like misinformation, spam, unfair competitions, fake news, fraud, blackmailing, deep fakes of real people, and more are things to be seriously concerned about and heavily regulate the software and properly identify its creations. A future where AI it&#39;s not regulated, limited or banned by an entity that favors the victims of the data it stole from, it&#39;s a future where creative jobs are no longer an option and it&#39;s also a future where people from all over the world has to doubt anything they see, hear and read because of massive misinformation.<br/><br/>I will begin to describe regulation ideas for this technology. Please consider mine as well as other creatives&#39; opinions, testimonies from victims from these technologies and those from ethics, copyrights and privacy experts.<br/><br/>AI companies should delete their actual models and retrain them only with data that they own or can legally use. This can only be possible by opt-in training data by asking for consent from the authors, giving credit and compensating them via paying for licenses or similar. In contrast, opt-out is not an option for consent, since it can not guarantee that everyone gives explicit permission to use their work and that their copyrights are repsected. The absence of an answer and absence of a &quot;no, I do not consent&quot; it&#39;s not the same as &quot;I consent&quot;. It should be explicit, direct, without a doubt and on a contract to give consent. Again, only possible by deleting their current models of AI and retraining them with opt-in data where authors explicitly give consent, they get credit and paid compensations.<br/><br/>Generative AI technologies in the work field should be limited or banned in work areas by regulations to guarantee fair competition, avoiding the replacement of human labor or unfair layoffs. In the case of allowing these technologies they should be integrated to generate more jobs positions and not replacing and decreasing the current ones. And also it should be avoided to demand more productions from workers once the AI tools facilitate their work; they should not be expected to produce more without earning more money.<br/><br/>All content generated with AI should be correctly and explicitly labeled as AI generated. Big watermarks, unerasable marks or texts, unique file type and other options should be considered and mixed to guarantee that at first sight the generations can be correctly identified as AI generated. Also it should be punishable as fraud to erase these marks and pass the info as real and we should pressure the AI companies to the highest standards so it&#39;s difficult to erase the labels. This should be accompanied with informational campaigns to educate the people on how to identify the generated AI info and to be skeptical about the info it presents.<br/><br/>Regulations against AI should never be within the hands of AI companies. It is not not neutral since they will always look for their favor. If there&#39;s a favor it should be with the victims of data stealing and victims of violations (like artists, creatives or whoever may be affected by these technologies and the stealing of data). The entity responsible for regulations should be the copyright and data privacy offices that apply the law of copyright and privacy rights. Within the conversations and talks of regulations it should be included AI ethics experts like Timnit Gebru and Emili Bender as well as organizations and guilds that advocate for the working people in the creative industry like WGA (Writers Guild of America West), Concept Art Association, Arte es &Eacute;tica from latin america and EGAIR (European Guild for Artificial Intelligence Regulation).<br/><br/>Thank you for reading.",

                "comment": "I am a United States citizen, shareholder of media companies and a creator myself and generative AI is something that needs to be reigned in. Moral implications of putting people out of work aside, generative AI is blatant copyright theft. More often than not, it uses unsolicited copyrighted material to generate images, written works and other forms of media. Why bother having copyright, if anyone can steal it without any repercussions. To me that is no different than when foreign superpowers take American invention and innovations and steal them for profit. Not only is generative, AI theft, AI, and its current state just is not good enough for what it claims to be able to do. More often than not, I found while using programs like Google search and Chat GPT, the information generated from it is often out of date and incorrect information. For example, a few months ago, I was using chat, GPT to help create a formatted citation for film credits for a fair use project on YouTube using a short 3 second clip from Spider-Man: The Animated Series (1994). I was struggling to find out who had the current distribution rights to the show, so I used ChatGPT to find the answer. It said the current rights holder was &ldquo;Buena Vista Television,&rdquo; a company name that has not been used by the Walt Disney Company since 2007. So programs like ChatGPT are getting easily searchable information, wrong, what else is it getting wrong. This could be a dangerous tool to spread misinformation and cause harm to the American public. No, I think with regulations put in, AI can be a great tool, it&rsquo;s already been used in our electronics and in our daily lives for decades. But that&rsquo;s all AI is, it&rsquo;s a tool and the fact is a tool alone cannot hold copyright and writing a prompt just isn&rsquo;t enough to facilitate a copyright claim in my option. You would never be able to copyright a tweet or a generic writing prompt so I don&rsquo;t see how an AI prompt is copyrightable. As with the case of Naruto the monkey, copyright is a law that pertains to human beings and human run entities. If a human being is not doing the majority of the work or is essentially &ldquo;filing off the plate numbers&rdquo; of AI generated work similar to fan fiction, you simply cannot copyright and profit off of that work. If we do not regulate now, then we are dooming America and it&rsquo;s innovation forever and that is simply unamerican. ",

AI can only output an amalgamation of what it&#39;s copied, a human can create something new. Furthermore, code produced by an AI is known to be unreliable.<br/>5. Yes. AI training datasets should be open to the public, and it should be strictly prohibited to use copyrighted material without explicit permission from the copyright holder. Terms of Service and Terms of Use should be barred from mandating permission to use submitted material in training datasets.<br/>6. As far as I know, whatever can be found on the Internet, using automated software, with little to no curation.<br/>6.2 As far as I know, almost never, which the only exceptions I know of being Getty Images and the Associated Press.<br/>8. Maybe noncommercial research. But generative AIs are generally being used to profit off other people&#39;s work without authorization or compensation.<br/>8.2 If they don&#39;t have permission from the copyright holder, they&#39;re pirates.<br/>8.3 It no longer becomes fair use once profit is involved.<br/>9. Opt in. Opt out is unacceptable.<br/>9.1 All uses.<br/>9.2 This is why opt in should be used. Opt out requires more effort to facilitate and doesn&#39;t resolve past infringement of copyrighted work.<br/>9.4 Copyright infringement lawsuit.<br/>9.5 Yes, but this should be settled by the author and the one hiring them.<br/>10 They should be contacted by the AI&#39;s creator.<br/>10.1 Of course, should both parties be willing.<br/>11 The biggest issue would be most people don&#39;t want their work to be used for training AI.<br/>13 AI companies that used copyrighted material to train their AIs would have to start from scratch, but that&#39;s their fault for training their AIs irresponsibly in the first place.<br/>15 Absolutely.<br/>15.1 Everything they used.<br/>15.2 A publicly accessible Website that can be searched.<br/>16 Ideally it should be mandatory to contact the copyright owner prior to use in training AI, but notification should be mandatory either way.<br/>18&ndash;21 No.<br/>22 Yes, if copyrighted material was used in the training dataset.<br/>24 Makers of AI should be legally required to make their training datasets accessible by the public. Existing laws do not suffice.<br/>25 Developers of the model.<br/>26 The AI violates it.<br/>28 Yes. Whenever it is shared.<br/>28.1 The AI developer and the end user.<br/>28.3 Fines.<br/>30 I&#39;m not sure, potentially laws against impersonation and defamation.<br/>31 Yes, a floor should be set, with states able to enact stricter standards.<br/>32 There should be, but I&#39;m not sure how such a law should be implemented.<br/>34 Using AI to imitate someone&#39;s voice and/or likeness is extremely perverted, especially without permission.<br/>",

The government is not ready for the amount of unemployment if this is allowed. they say 187 million jobs will be created because of AI but 185 million people will be unemployed because of it - thats ONLY if people are trained properly which eliminates a lot of the workforce over the age of 30. IBM is already firing people who hit 40. This will be a massive blow to Milennials/Gen Xers who still need to work for years to qualify for retirement. YOU MUST REGULATE TECH COMPANIES BETTER and AI should not be self regulated. Hire AI ethicists and experts (Sinead Bovell is one off the top of my head) you have no idea how many people who will put out of work if this is allowed. ",

As has already been determined in the court system, copyright is to protect human generated works, and there are several ways in which AI can abuse and manipulate this system. Additionally, most, if not all, currently available AI generation programs are trained on media that the original copyright holders did not give permission to train on. This results in the AI producing content that frequently contains elements of other copyrighted materials, and often times is not a properly transformative work.",

See: Greg Rutowski.<br/><br/>If allowed to proceed, owners would no longer be able to set the terms on their property, to decide if it is even used at all, and by whom, etc.<br/><br/>David Holz, of Midjourney said that it was not possible to get a hundred million images and know where they&#39;re coming from.<br/><br/>stock companies already exist for bulk. I put this to him on Twitter and was immediately blocked on the platform, stopping me from seeing further infringement and discussing it with users.<br/><br/>This blocking is common among this group of CEOs, who have colluded on Discord to erode these rights.",

It is akin to a human learning from these materials, which is not considered infringement.  Further, restricting AI training would not serve copyright&#39;s purpose of promoting the progress of science and useful arts.  Japan has taken the right approach on this topic by declaring that training AI does not violate copyright.<br/><br/>Output of generative AI should generally not be copyrightable, as the the IP value of the input prompt is generally minimal. There may be exceptional cases where an input prompt contains substantial IP value and has taken substantial effort to produce. In these cases, the burden should be on the producer to justify the copyright. <br/>",

There is no world where AI is an acceptable replacement for artists and their work. If an artist finds their work has been used to train an algorithm without their consent, that artist should be entitled to compensation and the owner/operator of the AI should be punished. There has to be transparency. Train and AI on your own work or admit you&#39;re just stealing from others to cut costs and cut corners at the expense of the hard workers<br/>",

                "comment": "Let me preface by saying that I am a computer scientist. I have used image generators, I know how they work on a technical level, and I have worked with them in unofficial capacity.<br/><br/>I believe people have a fundamental misunderstanding of AI. A small subset of people obsessed with the concept of AI media have poisoned the well of discourse by convincing people that AI-generated imagery is at or above that of human creativity. That by merely entering a text prompt, one is able to create beautiful works of art that rival<br/><br/>This is not true. Please direct your attention to the following image gallery: https://imgur.com/a/Sr142en<br/>These are a small sample of images I generated myself using an open-source program called Disco Diffusion, an image generator that utilizes Google&#39;s Colab servers to output images from text prompts. As you might note, these images are...ugly, frankly. None of them suited the purposes I had in mind when I generated them, most are downright incomprehensible, and they barely even match the prompts I used. Had I simply commissioned an actual artist to draw a beach at sunset (image #2) or a grassy hill (image #3), I would have received much higher quality images more easily.<br/><br/>This is what I mean by a misunderstanding; when people talk about AI in the media, they only show the &quot;good&quot; images. The tiny fraction of the output that somewhat matches the input. In any rational society, the debate about AI should have ended merely by showing people all the bad results, AI would have faded into obscurity, gone the way of slap bracelets and the pet rock, and we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation.<br/><br/>I do not think AI will replace real artists any time soon. However, I believe that the aforementioned small subset of people who have oversold AI&#39;s abilities will cause lasting damage to artistic integrity, and failure to regulate AI will result in longer-lasting damage.<br/><br/>With that in mind, here are the responses to the questions I believe I can answer in full confidence:<br/><br/>18. I do not believe there are any circumstances in which a human providing a prompt to an image generator can be considered&mdash;legally or in general&mdash;the &quot;author&quot; of a work. Telling someone or something to make art does not equate to creating art in of itself. As is precedent, a client who commissions art from an actual artist does not necessarily own the art either.<br/>21. I do not believe the copyright clause affords any protections to AI-generated work. The copyright clause explicitly mentions authors and inventors and, as noted above, I do not believe a mere text prompt warrants authorship.<br/>22. The right to derivative work holds precedent, however the office should note that derivative work is held to a different standard than outright copyrighted work. You cannot place a hat on Mickey Mouse, declare the work &quot;derivative&quot;, and claim ownership. Should AI be regarded as derivative work, it should be held to the same standards as existing derivative work.<br/>23. Substantial similarity is more than enough to investigate claims of infringement, if only to prevent the obvious loophole of someone running a copyrighted work through an AI that barely changes anything in an effort to declare the work &quot;derivative&quot;.<br/>24. Failure to make training data or legal documentation proving ownership of training data is a failure of the developer of the AI model, not a failure of the copyright owner. If they cannot provide documentation, it suggests obfuscation from the fact that they likely did not obtain or use the data legally.<br/>25. The owner of the service should be held liable for infringement, as they are the ones using the model to provide commercial services. The end-user in particular should not be held liable, as they were not aware of and have no control over the use of copyrighted material.<br/>25.1. The only unique aspect of an open source program is determining who provided the training data. The open source material is the code, the training data is what&#39;s infringing on copyright.<br/>28. AI-generated work should be labeled as such, if only by convention, much like an &quot;all persons fictitious&quot; disclaimer in a book, or a label indicating a photo has been edited in a news article. The propensity for people to lie by creating fake images is already well-documented with the rise of photoshop, any regulation of AI should nip this potential pitfall in the bud.<br/>30. As is precedent, a person owns their likeness, including vocal (e.g. as with voice actors). If a person does not provide explicit consent to their likeness being used in a commercial context, it is a violation of their right of publicity. The use of an AI to chop up soundbites or images of the person as opposed to a human being chopping up soundbites or images of the person is irrelevant.<br/><br/>I hope you consider my opinions in this inquiry. As a computer scientist, I feel my opinion is at risk of being subsumed under a &quot;pro-AI&quot; stance.<br/><br/>I emphatically reject this generalization.<br/><br/>AI must be regulated.",

Please do not let this happen. These AI are inherently based on stealing content and learning from people who generally did not consent to their content being used for the algorithm. ",

Artist spend years gathering experiences, skills and practice to hone their crafts and create unique works as a result of their life experiences.  AI is fed the end result of that work Wholesale with no accreditation, compensation or investment outside the coding used to create the algorithms. Thr coding of the AI, self standing and without the input of finished works made by flesh and blood artists would be incapable in its current iteration to produce any viable end product.  AI should never be used as an &ldquo;End of the line&rdquo; generative process but instead as a mid-process tool to assist in initial iteration of ideas but ultimately being completely transformed leaving the final work to be 100% of the user/artist.",

                "comment": "Artificial Intelligence could have been used to help creatives and guide us to the future. Instead, it is being used to hurt creatives by stealing their previous work to create &quot;new&quot; work. It&#39;s wrong and against the copyright law. I have always been told by teachers of the arts, &quot;If you write it, draw it, type it, or whatever, it&#39;s considered yours under copyright,&quot; but with AI being used to grab other people&#39;s work and likeness to create, that statement becomes false. AI should not be able to steal from others in order to create things. It should be used to enhance and help creatives with their work, either by giving them an extra idea to think about or putting a different color on their work if the artist doesn&#39;t like their original color palette. Hollywood studios are trying to pull a stunt and have scriptwriters edit AI &quot;written&quot; scripts to end the WGA strike AND to make it deemed &quot;copyrightable&quot;. They&#39;re also trying to use an actors likeness so they can make more films without needing the actor there (see Black Mirror episode, Joan is Awful, for reference) and not pay them. That&#39;s not fair to the writers and actors, and that&#39;s definitely not fair to those that use the copyright laws correctly. The government needs to put its foot down and create laws restricting AI from being used to create pieces of work that: A) steal from other pieces of work; and B) use the likeness of a person (their face, body, voice, etc.) without their permission or without proper compensation. The government also needs to make a law stating that editing an AI piece is not subjected to copyright because it was not created by a human in the first place. I&#39;d even say change the law altogether to say that something can be copyrighted if a HUMAN created it. That can include scripts, art, film, tv shows, music, even other humans since that&#39;s how reproduction is. Creating laws to regulate the use of AI can help us as humans remain creative and able to think outside of the box, while also keeping the rights of our ideas and bodies to ourselves. ",

However, there should be protections for a person&rsquo;s likeness and voice. I have seen news of movie studios wanting to use AI reconstructions of background actors for minimal compensation, and this is by no means acceptable. Each background actor should have protections in this matter.<br/><br/>As an artist myself, I have been hesitant to share my work freely on the internet due to AI training algorithms scraping people&rsquo;s work. I have also discouraged another artist from doing the same, and I regret having to do so. I fear the advent of AI will displace me as an artist, rendering my services as an artist irrelevant and useless; or worse, people will see my work and instantly credit AI.",

This is a threat to my way of living, as it could well harm my livelihood should the AI express an abhorrent viewpoint that could be mistaken as one that I myself hold.

                "comment": "Hello,<br/><br/>Thanks for accepting comments.  I&#39;m not a copyright expert, but I am both an artist and a user of generative AI models.  I have a few thoughts for your consideration:<br/><br/>1) I think that using copyrighted materials for training machine learning systems should fall under fair use, under most situations.  I think this protection should not apply if the training is &quot;overfit&quot; to any of its inputs, and is able to reproduce them very accurately.<br/><br/>2) I think that the outputs of a generative AI system should be copyrightable if a significant human creative effort went into their production.  For example, if you generated an image from stable diffusion, and used inpainting to recreate a portion of it, I think that is a creative act.  Similarly, if you put significant work into the prompt engineering for a certain work, I think that ought to be copyrightable.  However, I think that effort needs to be invested into a single resulting work.  Even if the prompt engineering effort was significant, you shouldn&#39;t be able to claim all possible outputs.<br/><br/>I feel like this approach is largely consistent with the historical and present interpretations of copyright.  I mostly am commenting because I hear a lot of anti-ai propaganda, and I want you to hear the other side of that.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time!",

Therefore, it is more important now than ever to ensure that the creative protection of human works is preserved, lest the exploitation of artists and creatives spirals even further.<br/><br/>1) AI works must only be trained on artists that have agreed to opt in to have their works trained. AI models should only be trained on works that have agreeably been opted in, or are not under copyright protection. AI works must be opt-in first; opt-out-only systems should not be allowed.<br/><br/>2) artists who have had their works trained upon must be properly compensated for their efforts, with a contractual agreement accepted by both the artist and the party using their works to train AI.<br/><br/>3) AI works should be properly labeled and/or described as being AI-assisted works. The barrier between what is AI-derived and what is authentic is continuously becoming harder to discern, and this leaves open the possibility of AI creators selling AI-derived work whilst posturing it as genuine art. This is tantamount to fraudulence, and should be punished accordingly.",

I have many friends who create art and it&#39;s been terrible to watch either parts of their work or whole pieces get used without their concent and without any financial reimbursement for AI to copy. I believe this is outright theft and that laws need to be put in place to protect artists and their creations. Artists had a difficult enough time with people stealing and copying their work before this AI was developed, and now that it&#39;s out and open for more and more people to use, the problem with copyright infringement has exploded.<br/><br/>Please consider how this technology is being used to harm people, and please help protect people. AI can be used to do amazing things, but we must make sure it&#39;s used for the benefit of all, and certainly not to bring harm or destruction to anyone.",

AI can be good if used correctly and should not be allowed to take power away from human artists because AI cannot truly create, it can only manipluate and combine what has already been created by humans.",

                "comment": "I work as a writer and, in my opinion, I think anything produced by AI should not be copyright protected at all. The reason copy right exists is to protect people&rsquo;s ideas and the products or works that they create, but the common theme in all of these works is that they all have intent. The person making them has an idea that they put to page/computer/etc. AI cannot think, it cannot have intent, therefore it cannot truly &ldquo;make&rdquo; anything. Any and all products of AI are just a glorified autocomplete made and tested by other people&rsquo;s works. On that note, how AI is trained should also be looked into and made public information, as since nobody knows how these AI programs are trained, it is very likely (id even hazard to say that they are definitely) trained off of works that they never got permission to use. If that doesn&rsquo;t violate current copyright laws, it should, as it uses someone else&rsquo;s ideas and works to train and make their own program without any permission, consent, or say from the original author, artist, or otherwise. Overall, I think AI in general needs to be cracked down on hard when it comes to both copyright for AI generated works, as well as using people&rsquo;s work to train the AI",

                "comment": "Questions:<br/>1. How AI models should use copyrighted data in training: AI models should NOT use copyrighted data in training without explicit permission from the copyright-holder that their data may be used for these purposes. The data scraping involved in AI training, as sophisticated as jargon can dress it up to be, is theft of the original copyrighted product in a way that the unaided human would be unable to achieve. The synthesis of a critical mass of these thefts constituting the end product simply means that rather than being a single plagiarism, the end product is a conglomerate of numerous plagiarisms. In a human the input of information is processed subjectively, individually, and often incompletely, resulting in personal interpretation and creative influence rather than theft. With AI the input of information is literally reproduced in every detail, deconstructed and the deconstructed components manipulated to create a Frankenstein&#39;s monster end product from the complete and already-created components of another&#39;s work. Between and human and AI these are not equivalent processes. AI is itself a product of human creation and a tool that responds to inputted prompts. A human directs the prompts for AI training and that human is responsible for the device they are wielding as it steals and plagiarizes the work of others.<br/>2. Whether AI-generated material can be copyrighted even without a human involved: This question presumes that AI exists without human intervention. As a machine-based technology, there will always be a person responsible for turning on the on-switch. A self-driving car would still need to be started by a human, presumably this leads to a possible human agent who would be liable for damage or injury caused by that technology of which they initiated the action. The effort should be to clarify the human involvement, not overestimate the independence of AI from human actors. If the human actors involved have not fully grasped the range and ramifications of their tool&#39;s theft and plagiarism, they should still be held liable for injury and harm caused by their tool. Generally in America lack of understanding that you have committed a crime does not absolve you of criminal liability. AI should be no different. In fact, because the theft and plagiarism of AI will specifically lead to a consolidation of labor, affect employment, and be leveraged to displace human labor and compensation, this should be treated with heightened scrutiny and punishment for infraction. Policy should be crafted based upon key acknowledgments and assumptions:<br/>Acknowledgment: AI training and creation based upon internet scraping and exposure to copyrighted materials without the permission of the owner is theft and exploitation.<br/>Assumption: Corporations and employers will use AI to replace human employees if it is less expensive to use AI software than employee human labor. Corporations have always valued profit above employee security or quality of life.<br/><br/>It is the responsibility of the US government to make the theft and exploitive use of human-created products an onerous crime in order to protect the existing products of human labor and to protect the jobs of humans whose labor is sustained by their individual creative efforts. Without costly penalties or restrictions, corporations will have no qualms about slashing entire job sectors if using AI means they have a more profitable bottom line. The US government must take the initiative with corporations never will and protect the interest of people over profit.",

                "comment": "AI generated images and text should not be allowed to be copyrighted. These generative programs are built on the backs of writers and artists without permission, consent, knowledge, or compensation. AI generation programs typically run on an &quot;opt out&quot; rather than an &quot;opt in&quot; model, which means most creators aren&#39;t even aware that their work is being used. On top of that, there have been multiple examples of AI generative tools using the work of dead artists, or artists without permission, and they refuse to delete datasets after the artist has asked for them to. <br/><br/>Beyond this, AI generative tools are taking away jobs. While I fully believe human art will always surpass AI generation, companies don&#39;t care because they think humans won&#39;t notice the difference. AI takes jobs away from people already struggling to make a living. It will devalue jobs and make it so people are paid less if they are asked to repair AI generated content. This has already been seen with translators&#39; jobs being devalued as they&#39;re expected to fix badly AI generated translations. <br/><br/>Don&#39;t give in to the demands of companies. Value human art and human creation. Only human created content should be allowed to copyright their creations. Human hands and minds are necessary for creation. Even AI generation relies SOLELY on human creation to even be a thing. ",

Those individual artists whose data has been scraped without their consent own the image of the elf, not the AI parent company, and certainly not me. I did not create anything. The AI did not create anything. AI is basically piracy software for art, and nobody should be allowed to copyright a pirated product as their own anymore than I can sample someone else&#39;s song and call it mine, or pirate a movie and claim it&#39;s mine now.",

We believe that there need to be regulations in regards to artificial intelligence. We are both authors, and have always registered our books through the copyright office. We also commission art works and obtain commercial license&#39;s and copyright for this work. But the threat to our work and our livelihood is on the line due to A.I. Our books are being into machines to be used as training without our permission, using our copyrighted work. Art is being fed into these machines to train A.I. for people to alter work that does not belong to them to be used for free. Art should be human made. Anything made by a machine, especially when it&#39;s being trained on work already created by a human without permission, should never be copyrightable. It&#39;s unethical. Not to mention the amount of jobs that are being eliminated because of this. So we are asking you to please not allow for A.I. to be copyrightable, and to add restrictions and regulations. Anyone using A.I. should gain the permission of the original artist, and that artist should be given recognition as compensation. ",

I was alarmed and outraged to hear that major AI systems have scraped writing for the purpose of training their AI, without compensation or consent, from certain sites on the internet where I share my work. Although I never gave permission for my work to be used in this manner, these companies are now able to profit from stolen work that myself and countless others have created, using their new plagiarism engines to put the people who unknowingly trained their system out of jobs.<br/><br/>In addition to the impact AI will have on creative industries, it will be disastrous for the work of researchers and journalists, leaving the general public with poorer quality misinformation in place of human-produced content. We&rsquo;ve already seen examples of AI supplying incorrect facts for journalistic articles, a lawyer presenting fake AI-generated cases, and how-to books on foraging that supply incorrect and dangerous information about poisonous plants.  <br/><br/>New legislation to address the detrimental effect of AI is needed urgently, before more damage can be done. AI-generated content, whether visual art, writing, or otherwise, should never be copyrightable. Additionally, generative AI models such as ChatGPT, which trained their system on stolen content without consent from or compensation for the creators, should be heavily penalized for using a system built on stolen work. Finally, news organizations or political campaigns that use AI-generated photos to mislead their reading or viewing public should be heavily fined. AI-generated news sites, research papers, and full texts without any human input should be banned entirely.<br/><br/>This is a hugely important issue for hundreds of thousands of people across the country whose livelihoods stand to be destroyed, for hundreds of thousands more who have been stolen from, and for millions who will be subject to the misinformation spread by AI in critical areas such as medicine, journalism, law, and other vital, fact-based areas where having the correct information can mean a life-or-death situation.<br/><br/>Please heavily restrict this technology before its negative impact can spread further.<br/><br/>https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-generative-artificial-intelligence-regulation/<br/>https://www.npr.org/2023/04/27/1172387911/how-can-people-spot-fake-images-created-by-artificial-intelligence<br/>https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/05/02/rapid-growth-of-news-sites-using-ai-tools-like-chatgpt-is-driving-the-spread-of-misinforma<br/>https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/lawyer-who-cited-cases-concocted-by-ai-asks-judge-spare-sanctions-2023-06-08/<br/>https://decrypt.co/154187/ai-generated-books-on-amazon-could-give-deadly-advice",

Generative AI has (or will shortly have) the ability to create books, poems, scripts, paintings etc. and in doing so, will erase humans from the creation of art. Generative AI should not be afforded the protection of a Copyright. The intent of a copyright is to encourage creation. If a writer knows their work will be fed into some machine then spit back out in an altered form and they are neither consulted nor compensated -- who will continue creating? Why create when your creation can be stolen, tweaked, then sold? While many create for the joy of it, our world demands practicality. We also have to pay for coffee and TVs and cell phone charging cords. Should every artist have a &quot;day job&quot; and create on the side? What kind of work do you think that will produce? When someone is underpaid and overworked the last thing they want to do is more work. Which is what creating (even when we love it) is. It&#39;s work. And farming that out to a computer so that a corporation can profit? That truly will be the end of our creative society.",

Should the same settings and toggles be applied to a machine learning creation engine, it would not matter who initiates the system, or even whether a human is involved at all. The resulting generations would be subject to touchups and edits at best, at which point the work is instantly a derivative of a piece that is already created. The process for verifying how much or how little a work has been modified to be compliant with even the most lenient conditions invites room for massive error, or downright abuse of the system.<br/><br/>In the simplest terms, it&#39;s little different than giving a wild animal a camera. Even if the resulting content is novel, interesting, and marketable, it is still content that is absent of human input beyond creating the conditions for it to be made.",

We clearly have a HUGE PROBLEM in this country surrounding millionaires and billionaires hoarding resources and eschewing responsibility for the harms they cause and subverting regulations intended to prevent them gaining monopolies, to the point that we as a country look foolish pretending we are anything other than a capitalist oligarchy&rsquo;s puppet.

                "comment": "There&#39;s an old canard about the law of large numbers that says if you put a million monkeys to work at a million typewriters that they&#39;ll eventually bang out a few Shakespeare sonnets. I think about that often when it comes to artificial intelligence and art, that they&#39;ve just replaced the monkeys with bytes and now a comedic thought experiment can be done in a server cluster or in your pocket. It makes for fascinating tools and toys, and as an artist there are certainly a few machine tricks that have made my life easier.<br/><br/>But in many ways AI creations seem to be poised to make my life as an artist a lot harder. In this response I would like to focus on two - the alienation of the artist and the unprecedented potential for copyright trolling.<br/><br/>Alienation of artistic labor arises from two sources. The first is the tendency of AI to displace artists with products that are deemed &quot;good enough&quot; in places where artists have been able to find a niche in capitalism (commercial illustration, graphic design, stock photography). Doubtless there will be consumers that reject &quot;good enough&quot; for great, but the elimination of the bottom of the market is the elimination of fertile grounds for talent to grow. It means that the cost to enter the market will increase, putting it out of the reach of a diverse and talented pool of creators and into the hands of people that have the money to take risks and the connections to get opportunities. This will necessarily narrow the vision of the filed and do damage to the progress of art.<br/><br/>The second way AI will create artistic alienation will be by turning artists into managers. Artists will not be the ones creating and innovating, they will be iterating prompts from AIs and checking to see if a picture has the correct number of fingers. Their role will be a quality assurance overview of a machine&#39;s output. While management is fine, it&#39;s not why people become passionate about art and design. Making the role of the artist solely to tweak or critique again narrows what the field can be and discourages people from pursuing art.<br/><br/>Looming larger over this is my concern that AI will lead to an explosion of copyright trolling, where businesses are generating works not for the sake of art (or even commerce) but to lay traps for others. One potential example comes from the crypto-boom where a company proposed selling off the color spectrum, saying that the owners of certain colors would get paid every time their color was used. Thankfully this scheme failed on its face, but it&#39;s not hard to imagine a dedicated business flooding the copyright office with computing power so that they can stand in the way of any conceivable work like toll collectors demanding a fee to let you pass safely. Sure, you might have prevailed in court - but the cost to litigate the script for your student film or first novel would be far more than you&#39;d ever make off of it, so you pay the toll collectors and if you can&#39;t pay the toll collectors then you get a job at Foot Locker.<br/><br/>Not allowing AI-generated art to be copyrighted stymies both of those tendencies. It allows for a free and fair market for artists, and will better encourage people to pick up a pen, a camera, or a brush and participate in the arts.<br/><br/>Of course there are going to be gray areas and ambiguities, where what might have started as an AI prompt becomes somethign more after human hands like a sculptor bringing a statue out of a rock that was already vaguely shaped like a guy. Plumbing the depths of that intersection and finding the point where the spark of life should begin is a bit beyond me and seems like it could be handled with the same kind of judgment and discretion we see for things like sampling and fair use.",

                "comment": "10.1. There is clear and unambiguous precedent for copyright owners to provide training data under an affirmative consent model in a way which produces worthwhile output. An example I am personally aware of is a 2020 collaboration between the Dadabots team and music educator Adam Neely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xMhRwxXJTc<br/><br/>In this example, the makers of the AI system instructed Adam Neely to produce suitable training material, which he did, and then used that material to create a neural network that generates sounds endlessly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRwJzw4VvZA<br/><br/>It is clear from examples like these and the other collaborations mentioned by Dadabots that AI systems trained on voluntarily-collected training data can generate worthwhile material, and therefore that research can be done and the field of AI advanced without use of unlicensed material.<br/><br/>We accept the necessity of restrictions in other fields for the sake of ethics. Even in the middle of a pandemic, where the testing of a vaccine was of tremendous urgency, we did not simply expose people to COVID-19 and see which ones got sick. We did not have to - we could simply wait and observe how many accidental, unavoidable infections occurred and progressed to full illness. However much excitement there is about the possibilities represented by generative AI, if there are copyright concerns about the training data (and I believe many people have convincingly argued there are), it is unambiguous that there are ways to develop generative AI without such concerns.",

                "comment": "As a writer and a photographer, I am certainly concerned with my IP being used in AI models without my consent. The issue that I am most concerned with is the sneaky &quot;opt-out&quot; policies that different corporations use without notifying artists or content providers directly of a change that allows any content to be used in AI models. For example, I sell my photographs through Adobe Stock. Adobe&#39;s policy on use of AI is not just extremely confusing, it is almost impossible to find. There is competing information as to whether or not my photos are automatically now included in Adobe&#39;s Generative AI features, whether it is yet to come, whether I will be notified via email/etc and allowed therefore to opt-in or opt-out, or if this will simply be rolled into the Terms of Service and therefore I must hunt to see if my IP is now being used in AI prompts. I do not feel that this is correct, and I&#39;m aware of other companies doing something similar. I believe that there should be laws and regulations made so that companies must 1) inform artists of their policies specifically via email, mail, or notifications on the site; 2) must receive specific OPT-IN from artists to use their content in generative AI models, not receive an opt-out; 3) have specific policies that are easy to read, easy to find, and easy to understand to know how my images are being used.<br/><br/>While I make money based on my images being sold, and therefore understand that any such site has certain rights to the images I am uploading, when I uploaded them, there was no AI. Adobe (along with any stock photography site) makes money from my images as well, and it is not correct for my images to make them more money without my compensation being increased, and in addition, it is not correct for them to be able to make money from images that I only provided under a specific type of agreement. <br/><br/>At it&#39;s core, &quot;opt-out&quot; policies in tech should be outlawed. It is in the best interest of us all to be conscious of what we are opting-into, versus having to find out later on we&#39;ve been enrolled in programs or policies that were not clearly and proactively communicated to us.

As I see it, any company that wishes to engage in using something that is as non-fungible as a human voice as part of their own offering is violating what I consider International Copyright law.

The capability of the system to recognize patterns to reproduce anything requires the input of an uncountable number of resources. The only way the developers of these systems can acquire access to these resources is by the forced access and theft of others&#39; assets all over the world. Through the use of manual copying, digital scraping, and others. This is clearly copyright infringing. The reproduction of someone&#39;s work can be easily attained by simply telling the system to recognize and target an individual specifically. Even without targeting. The &quot;AI&quot; will use a number of private assets to make patterns within a given work, all without being substantially transformative in its process and result.",

It is also not INTELLIGENT by any means - it has been proven to be subjected towards bias and falsifying any information.  It takes away any means of individual claims only to feed corporations that will twist it towards any of their bias towards making money with no care who or what it is destroying in the process.  It is a machine basically that is run on human programing that is geared towards the algorithm of matching results it gains from whatever source it&#39;s pulling from.  The falsifying frame work of what it does and how it uses human created arts, or even humans themselves living or dead, should not be considered anything other than a fake and in no way be considered legal on any level.",

                "comment": "AI generated works are a massive threat to all creative industries. More and more visual artists I know are afraid to share their work as they don&#39;t want either accused of using an AI or to have their works fed to an AI to turn it new work. There is talk recently that fiction writers are having works fed into AI as well, to either &#39;finish&#39; from samples or allow for large companies to train new AI to potentially replace their writers. <br/><br/>If AI generated works become protected under copyright creative endeavors of the human mind, the very thing copyright is meant to protect and encourage artists to create, becomes meaningless. Some people argue this enables more people to create, but instead it steals possible income from artists of all walks of life and mediums while reducing the encouragement to learn to create for amateurs. <br/><br/>The very nature of copyright and what it means to us as creators is art risk. AI art is the method of attack. Do not destroy the years of dedicated work and practice I and millions upon a millions of others have given ourselves to. ",

                "comment": "I am completely against AI being copyrightable. These algorithms are not in any way intelligent, there is no original creation in anything that the algorithm gives you.  The actual term for these algorithms is &quot;Aggregate Engine&quot;. The only way for these engines to produce any sort of content is to feed it other artwork or literature. Additionally because of the way these work, all current &quot;AI&quot; work is being fueled with stolen artwork. Additionally these engines cannot reprocess what they create. If fed their own creation, the engine sees significant instability and loses all accuracy in the prompt given. There is not a single ethical way for the readily available options to create their own content. All artwork must either be taken randomly from the web, which will allow the engine to work by sheer volume of things to copy and mimic. Without a constant intake of new styles, artwork, text, and even voice; these engine crumble. There is not a means to fuel these in any ethical way. They consume far too much and do so by web scraping or manual feeding. Either of which gravely violates the original copyright of the artist&#39;s artwork and transforms it into a gross copy, melded with as many other similar images as possible. I urge the US copyright office to disavow &quot;A.I.&quot;, name the engines as what they actually are, and prevent millions of jobs from being taken from innocent Americans. This will kill the creative industry and make everything we consume soulless. The very point of art is to intrigue thought and show an individuals expression. Allowing this to happen will have grave and far reaching consequences that will require more than regulation to fix. This will also destroy business&#39; that allow artists to host their own artwork as merchandise. They will be flooded with meaningless exact duplicates. ",

It cannot make decisions. It does not, cannot and will not ever know right from wrong. It only knows what its been programmed to know. <br/><br/>It excludes information based on what the developers tell it to exclude. It is bias in information based on what the developers views are - conservative, liberal, conspiracy drive, science driven, etc.<br/><br/>As such, what we call AI is truly nothing more than a search engine of knowledge combined with a mirror test. <br/><br/>To limit what it can store in its databases, would be the equivalent of telling Google search that it can not store cache copies of websites, store website titles, store descriptions nor index images.<br/><br/>Even when we talk about image based AI, just like when dealing with an AI chat bot, it does not &quot;steal&quot; anything. It reviews information it has and feeds it back to the user in ways never before spoken or, in the case of art, ways never before seen.<br/><br/>From an art perspective AI is just a new tool to create art. Just like traditional tools, one can use it to create forgery works but that&#39;s been done in the art world since long before AI. AI, unless specifically instructed to, does not produce copywritten works. <br/><br/>Because of these things, it would be as illogical to say we can&#39;t &quot;train AI&quot; on copywritten works as it would be to say &quot;people cannot study and learn&quot; from copywritten works. All AI is, is a search engine feeding us back information in completely new formats... very similar to a child researching a topic for a book report... and rewriting everything they learn in their own words.<br/><br/>I think my point has been made.",

                "comment": "As of the current technology, AI is a misnomer. There is no &quot;intelligence&quot; in machine learning, it is just mixing together the inputs following a formula. The formula itself (i.e. the inner workings of the &quot;AI&quot;), created by a human, may be considered a work of art, but not what the formula produces. The product of the &quot;AI&quot; should not be copyrightable by the prompter any more than someone can take a public image off the internet and copyright it. The fact that multiple public works are involved in each result is not enough evidence of human creation; the work of creating a prompt is nowhere near comparable to the work of actually putting the inputs together (which is done by the formula, not the human). While some may argue that a human taking &quot;inspiration&quot; from existing art is the same, I completely disagree. When a human artist takes &quot;inspiration&quot; to create their own work, their life experiences and physical skill are also involved in the creative process, even for less physical skills like photography. The &quot;AI&quot; uses only the inputs (which have their own copyrights) and what is included in its formula (which would be copyrightable by the person who created the &quot;AI&quot;, and not anyone else who uses it). In short, &quot;AI&quot;-generated outputs should not be copyrightable and &quot;AI&quot; should not be allowed to use copyrighted works as inputs without express permission from the copyright holder. As such, it should be required for all AI tools to have a comprehensive and easily accessible list of all inputs and their copyrights and evidence of permission for every input.",

The argument of &quot;opting out&quot; has been made to obstruct individuals from being removed from the dataset.<br/><br/>Those companies did this willfully, they knew and confirmed that decision was purposful , becasue  during polling, they had recieved about 90%+ Disagreement from creators if they would agree with their work being used to train the dataset.<br/><br/>If the technology was not used for commercial purposes, but instead research, that would have been superb experiment, however thats not what happened..<br/><br/>The Tech companies are now  implementing paying models from scrapped works from non-consenting artists, and image datasets which are poisioned with copyrighted work.<br/><br/>Should companies provide compensation to every artist that their dataset was used in training the model, in forms of residuals, then that would be optimal solution, of course - IF artists or creators CONSENTED for their data to be used in that attempt.<br/><br/>Although I do not currentlly reside within US, my business also includes US customers, AI  - in current form - is impacting that business and disrupting the industry by allowing unregulated use, exploiting both individual rights as well as corporate intellectual property.",

                "comment": "AI cannot replace the human experience. It is grossly negligent that instead of developing AI to fix dangerous professions and dilemmas which could save human life, the professionals in the field have chosen to pursue avenues which strip humanity of our experience. Art should be left to humans, it is our shared experience and our humanity that creates art, that creates work that transcends centuries and culture because it is a reflection of the human experience. AI should be used to create programs and robotics that can save human lives. No more miners with injuries, or oil riggers with lost limbs. Use AI to make jobs safer for humans not to strip our souls. AI shouldn&rsquo;t be making poetry. It should be developed in service to human life. Aid humanity in a safer and cleaner future. Not one where our voices are silenced in exchange for a computer&rsquo;s rendering of literature. ",

                "comment": "Greetings.<br/><br/>I am a vocal artist (narrator and voice actor) and author who strongly opposed AI in the arts. My dream has always been to be able to sustain on what I love to do in life, which is create art. The human experience and new ideas are introduced through art, which has evolved throughout the ages. Be it through writing, visual art, vocal art, or anything else. <br/><br/>AI removes the human experience and any new ideas from art by using stolen copyrighted works from human artists. It is an excuse to not put the work in to learn the skill. It isn&#39;t a matter of &#39;advancing technology&#39; like going from newspaper to television. It is typing in a few words for a &#39;prompt&#39; gives a cobbled mishmash of creatives&#39; hard work they did not give permission to use. There is nothing new there. <br/><br/>We will never advance in the arts if we are stuck by AI, because creatives will stop creating. Why continue to create if our work is going to be stolen and fed to a machine, to be regurgitated as some &#39;techbro&#39; or corporation trying to make a quick buck? <br/><br/>As a vocal artist, people are opting to go with AI from stolen voices as opposed to real narration, which requires acting. Text-to-speech is a robotic voice and helps with accessibility, which I am not against - but training an AI through stolen narrators to properly act and try to capture the emotion of a book? That is horrible.<br/><br/>Video games lose their soul, and as a consumer, AI characters which includes voice acting and writing, or other assets, would completely ruin my experience. Again - there are no new ideas there, and even if there were, it would be stolen without permission.<br/><br/>Humans can learn from one another in writing or art. But if I copied an entire novel from several others and put it together, it would not be creating anything. If I traced other artists&#39; work and presented it as my own, it would not be creating anything. Humans learn and then present new ideas with what we&#39;ve learned. AI cannot do that. <br/><br/>Creatives will be impacted to a gigantic degree if this is not regulated. There will be a massive downtick in genuine human art in all areas. Writing, music, visual, voice acting, animation, every category. What we are left with is soulless and without progression. Giant corporations will replace artists with talent and genuine love for their craft to save money. Time and again, greed has won out in this country. This will be no different.<br/><br/>Unless universal basic income can be implemented, where creatives would be able to make genuine art alongside the AI and offer it to the public (without risk of it being stolen and fed to the machine), this would be the end of human-created art as we know it. It would be less of a problem if all of the data was not stolen from people who did not give permission, at least the &#39;ethical tool&#39; excuse could apply, because it would have been given with permission. That clearly is not the case.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s sad. We&#39;ve lost one of the most beautiful things about being human if we lose the arts.",

                "comment": "I am a television director and independent writer, and I am concerned about the implications of unregulated AI will have on copyrights and livelihoods. Currently, copyright holders have little to no recourse when their words are scraped--stolen--by unregulated AI datasets and machine learnings. Reasonable regulations would protect copyright holders without hindering innovation. As new technologies emerge, we must work to make sure we are using technology in the most responsible way possible. I&#39;m concerned that the increased use of unregulated AI technologies will have catastrophic ramifications to our creative fields, including but not limited to art, writing, and even music. In a world just a few short years after the start of a global pandemic, during which we retreated to the sanctuary of the arts, films, television, books, etc., we cannot allow for those careers, those creatives, to be sidelined while AI regurgitates the scraped--stolen--words and ideas, sans the human nuance. I don&#39;t want my words to speak for someone else - I want my words to speak for me.",

                "comment": "As a librarian that has worked in both academic and public libraries for roughly a decade and who has worked with and spoken to many authors and readers during this time I want to state my extreme concerns regarding the intellectual theft that powers most, if not all, AI chat and art bots at this time. Beyond my base level concern with how AI operates, I feel we must be absolutely clear that in order to qualify for copyright several conditions must be met. These conditions include: one, that the work must be fixed in a tangible medium; two, that the work must be original; and three, that the work must have an author. The work being created by AI is NOT original, it is in fact the regurgitation of unattributed works that have been used without the creator&#39;s permission to fuel the AI. Yes, at times the AI may generate a new sentence but it is all based upon the unattributed works of others. Furthermore, the work does NOT have an author. In the case Naruto, a Crested Macaque, v. Slater (Apr. 23, 2018), the court held that non-human animals could not bring a case of copyright infringement to court. If an animal, a sentient animal capable of creating art, cannot hold copyright over it&#39;s own creations, why would any entity that is not alive or (currently) sentient, be able to? In my capacity as an information professional it is very clear that AI generated text, art, and other creations, fall outside the realm of copyright and should not be considered by any legal body to be able to hold any such claims.",

                "comment": "Artistic works created (even partly) by Artificial Intelligence should never be afforded Copyright protection. The slope is just too slippery. This is a technology that even its creators can&#39;t quite explain, and yet is being heralded by certain tech/business people as some kind of cost-saving, time-saving tool. But it&#39;s not a &quot;tool&quot; at all - it&#39;s an existential threat to humanity in that many would flock to use it to replace the very creativity and inventiveness that has allowed the human race to thrive and evolve. And if humans are deprived of the opportunity to create (since none of us would stand a chance in terms of market economics against an unpaid machine), then a very major piece of what makes us humans will cease. A world where stories of hope, despair, longing, conquest, etc. are no longer shared (as they have been for thousands of years) by those who&#39;ve experienced life, but instead regurgitated through the filter of some algorithm, is a world that can no longer learn and evolve naturally. <br/>Just as importantly as the macro, existential issues, A.I. generated work should not be afforded copyright protection because it requires no real effort to create the work. Artists and creators achieve through some combination of talent and/or extremely hard work. And while I realize that &quot;hard work&quot; is likely not a legal threshold that can be considered, it is still a part of the recipe of what makes something truly &quot;original&quot;.  All of the mental permutations and life experiences that go into forming something that&#39;s truly unique can never be replicated by a machine, or by someone typing prompts into a machine. I, like millions of others, have no interest in listening to music created by a non-musician who merely knows how to take advantage of the latest technology. I&#39;ve worked in technology for over twenty years, and I&#39;ve had multiple troubling conversations where software engineers with no real investment in creativity or the arts have stated their intentions to (and this is an exact quote from one engineer): &quot;...just crank out a few books without having to write shit...&quot; What a pointless world it would be if this were to become a widespread mentality...which I believe it would if A.I. work were giving legal protections.<br/>I understand the argument that some use that &quot;there&#39;s no putting the genie back in the bottle&quot;, or even &quot;how would anyone know if I used A.I.?&quot; But those tragically defeatist arguments can both be struck down by never affording the A.I. work any kind of copyright protection. Studios and publishers aren&#39;t going to risk their businesses by producing works that can be legally copied/imitated and distributed. It would be an unsustainable model. And the argument that &quot;nobody would know&quot; is just another lazy way for certain people to excuse bad behavior. The ability to &quot;get away&quot; with something should never correlate to how much we tolerate it or allow it. <br/>I hope you will focus, above all else, on what a critical inflection point this is in the history of humanity. Allowing for any kind of copyright protection for A.I.-generated works will instantly erode the many incredible creations that are yet to come. Technology has come too far, too quickly, because it has been a focus for decades. But perhaps it&#39;s time to reverse or at least dramatically slow that trend. <br/>I hope you will help ensure humanity&#39;s continued survival, because that&#39;s literally what&#39;s at stake.<br/>Thanks so much for taking the time to read my comment.

AI technologies are currently one of the greatest threats to intellectual property and the methods that they are using to &ldquo;create&rdquo; their content absolutely violates what those of us in the creative fields hold dear. Copyright law needs to close all potential loopholes that those who engage in AI creation will try to exploit to steal the property of others. This needs to happen now. We can&rsquo;t have half measures, thinking we&rsquo;ll fix it later after we see what it does.  It&rsquo;ll be too late by then. If we go down this path, we need regulations in place to audit where AI is getting it&rsquo;s materials from and make sure that the owners of those materials are fairly compensated and credited. ",

                "comment": "I would like to start with the fact that generative AI is not human intelligence, it only mimics it. It has no will of its own and is a Machine Learning algorithm. The only differences between generative AI and say, the Youtube algorithm, are the data input into the algorithm and the parameters its owners set. <br/><br/>What these machine learning algorithms do, is they sample works from thousands of artists and stitch them together into something that isn&#39;t technically real art, because a human hand did not create it. Many AI proponents will say that humans do the same thing by studying other artists and learning their skills and techniques, but to get it out of the way, the machine does not learn like a human would, yes we study and &quot;steal&quot; from other artists, but as our skills develop we take the lessons we learned and are able to create our own art without referencing other artists . A machine cannot copy style or skill, it needs the actual art to recombine. If a machine isn&#39;t given art to copy and recombine, it cannot create anything. A child could draw something if given a paper and pencil, it my not be good, but it will be genuine art the child created of their own imagination and skill. <br/>But to bring this point further, even if the AI is creating art, the prompters and people who wish to profit off of AI, are not creating art. Many will argue that it takes time and skill to input the right prompts to get a result and that they should get credit for their ideas, however there is a rule in copyright called sans affaire which means you cannot copyright ideas. Essentially they are commissioning the algorithm to create an artwork and get the credit for it, even though they did not do the work. The algorithm is the artists and should therefore get the credit and profits, but the machine can&#39;t get credit or compensation for a work. These works do not belong to an AI and they especially don&#39;t belong to a prompter. No one likes an &quot;idea guy&quot;. The real credit and compensation should belong to all the artists whose work was sampled, who gave the AI its data set to work off of. <br/>To better understand this, think of the prompter as someone ordering a cake from a baker who would be an AI. The AI does all the work and gets paid, even if the prompter gives the baker the idea for the cake, the baker gets paid and gets the credit for creating that cake. And on top of that the baker paid money for everything they used to make the cake; the ingredients that came from a grocer which came from a farm, the equipment used to bake and mix, and the store which was built by someone else, the baker paid for all of these things. In this analogy all those other people would be the artists the AI samples, the baker paid or compensated those people, they didn&#39;t claim they made the oven or made the sugar,everyone knows it came from somewhere else. What the prompter wants to do is have the baker steal all the equipment and ingredients, make their cake, not pay the baker and sell the cake for their own profit and take credit for making it. That is a basic idea of why AI should not be copyrighted, the art does not belong to the AI and because you can&#39;t copyright ideas, the art should not belong to the prompter. <br/><br/>As to what policies should be enacted to limit AI and protect artists and creatives, here are my ideas. Firstly AI art should not be able to copyrighted because it is not original art. AI art should always be clearly and prominently marked as AI &quot;art&quot;. If someone posts AI art online they should be obligated to clearly cite and reference all the art pieces and artists the AI sampled to create the &quot;art&quot;. If a person falsely passes an AI made piece as their own and made money off of it, they should be required to recompense the artist that the algorithm used to sample its piece. The one exception I would make for making money off an AI piece is if an artists only used their own work as a sample for the algorithm, if they can prove that only their art was sampled then they can profit off of it, but they must still clearly label it as AI. If someone used AI art to profit off a work, but claims they edited it and added their own ideas to the piece, such as a book, they still need to mark it as AI made or perhaps &quot;Partially made with AI&quot; and then they should still compensate the other artists whose work was sampled to make the art piece, perhaps a judge will have to determine to what degree the art is AI made and what the percentage should be, but I would argue that the base compensation should be 50% of profits made. <br/>Essentially artists, and I use artists to regard all creatives from visual artists to musician to writers, aren&#39;t against AI. It is a tool and like any tool it can be used for good or for wickedness. A hammer can build a house or bludgeon a head, its all in how it&#39;s used. I want a system in which artists don&#39;t have to fear that their livelihoods will be jeopardized because AI can do their work faster and cheaper. Help artists.",

AI text generators like chatgpt are trained on tons of copyrighted work because they just copy paste tons and tons of text from all over the internet. It&#39;s very likely that various doxxes (credit cards, addresses, etc.) are in chatgpt&#39;s training set. And if it&#39;s in the training set, it might be possible for users to extract that information<br/><br/>A more important concern is that media companies are now using AI image/video generators to replace artists and completely ditch their jobs. This both further diminishes the united states&#39; already rocky artistic integrity and significantly hurts jobs<br/><br/>Now, I know that capitalism runs on poverty, but I&#39;m pretty sure writers and graphic designers, of all people, would be quite effective at rallying the people against you in the event you don&#39;t uphold your oath to protect the American people<br/><br/>(Also AI image/text generators can make porn and as we all know porn is evil)",

                "comment": "The copyright office must take quick and decisive action against the publicly hidden and wildly illegal actions of AI developers who are training their AI models on copyrighted work created by humans. They have already been trained by scraping countless millions of works registered with the USCO. These AI companies stand to make enormous sums of money by leveraging (e.g. stealing) copyrighted work from artists and creators without proper compensation or credit. This is theft on an incalculable scale. These technologies are derivative, not transformative, as they exist simply to replicate existing works and are unable to operate without human ingestion of copyrighted training models. Put simply: these AI models would not function without the illegal use of copyrighted work. In fact, the entire business models of AI developers are dependent on the illegal use of copyrighted work and their business would collapse with proper legal enforcement of protected works. No matter how powerful these products may prove to be - a business that is fundamentally unable to abide by long established legal principles of copyright law is not a viable business. <br/><br/>It is imperative that a regulatory framework is established to protect humans&#39; copyrighted work - requiring public transparency for what is fed into AI training models as well as proper record keeping and compensation for all works used. If an AI company is unable to pay for the fair use of copyrighted material in developing and marketing their business, then they should not operate in a commercial capacity. We must hold AI developers to the same standards as all other commercial enterprises. <br/><br/>Further, they should not be permitted to scrape anything posted by users on social media. ",

The entire reason we have copyright law in the first place is to protect an individuals right to their own intellectual property, whereas these machines have no intelligence and thus, cannot actually create. They can only steal other people&#39;s work and hope for the best. Besides, watching TV shows by actual people is more interesting because a machine doesn&#39;t have the memory of all the times it&#39;s siblings sold them out to mom but also you can speak entirely in Disney and the barbie movie quotes at each other. That&#39;s going to make for much funnier writing than anything a misleadingly named &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; can do. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re really asking for much honestly, just &#39;please don&#39;t replace real people and the stories they love creating and we enjoy with 200 shows of the exact same premise by a machine can&#39;t tell any new stories&#39;. <br/><br/>If you want an example, look no further than the extremely popular CSI shows and how well all of them but Cyber did. Cyber was so dreadfully boring that even the CSI name, which was hugely popular and everyone still talks about them, couldn&#39;t save the bland writing from getting it cancelled after three seasons. 3! The original NCSI show is still going to this day! The real problem with shows getting cancelled after one these days is because studios don&#39;t want to pay people a living wage, and AI is only going to make this worse. Please do something before all the big broadcasting networks go bankrupt because nobody wants to watch their five different versions of beige shows.",

I have made book covers professionally, and now major publishers like S&amp;S are using AI generated book covers without the permission of the artists whose work trained the data sets. I am a writer and I am afraid of people feeding my writing to an AI without my consent. I believe a solution is to broadly prohibit the use of AI generated materials for commercial use.",

                "comment": "I&#39;d like to start out by saying that I am a professional artist, and I have a lot of insight on the matter. Not just because I have m brand to worry about, but also because I have seen the attitude and conduct behind the people using AI to generate art for sales, and recognition. The fact is that AI cannot produce new artwork. It samples existing images based on the hard work and talent of other people. It&#39;s a shame that I should have to explain the principle of plagiarism, but if you use someone else&#39;s words and stitch them together in a written report, it&#39;s blatant plagiarism. It&#39;s the same thing where art is concerned. AI does not consciously put in the time, or the effort that it takes to learn these skills. While I understand that every artist is inspired by something, as &quot;prompters&quot; are so quick to mention, neither the prompters nor the AI is capable of making it truly their own. Truly unique, in other words. There is already law that protects artists of all kinds from plagiarism. Even fair use laws have limitations.<br/><br/>AI generation is a tool that does nothing to discourage the use of other people&#39;s work to train the AI models without the consent, or knowledge of the artists. The only work these people have to put in, quite literally to type in a prompt in all cases, and in some cases, feed the stolen artwork into the system.  Mind you, AI does have its legitimate uses. There are many types of AI. And even AI generated images can be helpful, as long as the generated image is not part of the final product. But in terms of assisting with organizing a composition, or ideas FOR REFERENCE ONLY, I personally think it&#39;s alright. But that is not the attitude behind the prompting community.<br/><br/>The fact is, and I can personally certify, that prompters are the same sort of people who complain about websites like Patreon being a paywall. It&#39;s people who treat art are a right, not a luxury that people have to work for. The art people make is every bit a product they have to work to create, and if they want paying for the work, then they should be paid. That is a hallmark of capitalist society, and it should be protected. Furthermore. They will say things like &quot;artists are being elitists&quot; who &quot;bully&quot; these thieves into giving up their &quot;rights&quot; to use our work without our consent. They say we are attempting to control the artistic market. The fact is that if they put in the same work, there would be no question of &quot;bullying&quot;, or &quot;control&quot;. This is the same argument that motivates piracy, which is illegal. Some of them even use AI generated images to harass the artists they steal from for daring to make some of their work Patreon exclusive so they can make a buck in this harsh economy.<br/><br/>Artists are facing enormous difficulty making a living as it is. And each of these artists are, in their own right, small business owners. These endeavors to steal our hard work, such as NFTs (which were proven to host stolen, unedited artwork for sale by grifters), and now AI generated art, which use frankly another attempt by the same people to gain money, or recognition based on other people&#39;s work, are destroying are small businesses and taking away our God given right to work in this country, when some of us literally can&#39;t get stable work anywhere else. I implore the people of this office to please consider the big picture here... no pun intended. We provide a service, charged through websites like PayPal and the like. Those sites take fees per transaction and those transactions are taxed by the government. We play a big role in funding the government, and should be therefore protected by the government. The thieves who take our work don&#39;t pay a dime. They certainly don&#39;t pay anything that can be taxed. And fully productions using AI as the bulk of their workforce, deenriches the whole world, not to mention denies us jobs in the industry. Especially now that AI models are sampling their own images and breaking more and more. Well, it should tell you that an entertainment industry run by AI will entertain no one. And you need entertainment to boost morale and frankly prevent insanity within the working class. Everyone needs some escapism. Please help preserve the quality of our escapism and motivate your tax payers.",

Already online spaces have been flooded with generated content, thereby stripping the usefulness of these spaces when all you see are the same 3 images in 500 different variations. People at the bottom of these creative totem poles will be suffocated out of spaces and jobs without responsible AI regulation. Within not even a generation we will see hundreds of creative fields go dead. Already I have friends who have lost their jobs due to AI being implemented irresponsibility within their companies. Without responsible AI regulation, our already suffering job market will continue to decline. It is not enough to listen to the creators of these AI tools. We cannot take their recommendations when they are set up to gain the most. Why else would they recommend it? They do not want to have a failed product but the fact of the matter is, they do not have any product at all. These datasets were taken without consent, infringe on copyright, and should be punished as such. If that means they no longer have a product then that means the US law is working! We cannot make exceptions, or ignore the problem just because it means the destruction of something convenient. The creators of these tools must be held accountable for the illegally obtained datasets and dramatic effect it is having on the market and livelihoods of people within creative fields. ",

                "comment": "I am a software engineer by profession as well as a hobbyist artist and writer. So-called AI art and writing generation programs do not actually generate art or writing. What they do is take things that people have made through their own hard work and creativity and output pieces of it, then claiming to have created a new piece of art and writing. Often this is done without the permission of the original creator. If AI-created works are allowed to have copyright, innovation in art will be stifled. The ability of artists and writers (and actors, given efforts by studios recently to increase the use of AI-generated likenesses in movies, as highlighted by the recent WGA/SAG strikes) to earn a living would be stifled, stifling the ability of these creative individuals to earn a living and continue to make art and writing. AI-created content is thievery. It&#39;s not created by a person. There&#39;s no creativity involved, only math. The closest thing we have in art would be collage, but even a collage artist makes choices and uses their judgement to pick the images they combine to make new art. AI-created content, whether in writing, art, in a movie, in a voiceover, should not be allowed to have a copyright.",

Studying existing artwork to interpret, deduce, and infer style and technique as a means of learning how to produce art is a part of every artistic curriculum on the face of the planet, and will continue to be such for as long as such education exists.  Artificial Intelligence and Generative Technologies are not &quot;copying&quot; art that they are exposed to.  They are being trained on correlating stylistic technique to verbal prompts and are being taught what &quot;art&quot; is through demonstration and exhibition -- just like an organic human mind would learn.  There is absolutely no copyright infringement occurring with the use of Generative Technologies and Artificial Intelligence.  The training that these systems undergo is not plagiarism and is not in any way, shape, or form derivative in any sense that would violate existing U.S. Copyright Law.  Advocates against this technology are modern day Luddites who do not understand the technology that they are criticizing.  They are fueled by emotion rather than logical, rational thought.  They have no desire to research and learn the basis of what they are criticizing, and the involvement of the U.S. Copyright Office should be entirely limited / constrained to the governance of the issuance of Copyright Claim to the prompter / producer of Generative Works, which SHOULD be subject to the same exact Copyright Protections enjoyed by traditional medium artists.",

Images, books, articles, poems, etc. created via Artificial Intelligence platforms should not be granted copyright.  Users or AI platforms are little more than project managers instructing a tool trained on stolen works of art to generate the most likely version of an image based on probability of what color the next pixel should be or what probability determines the next word should be.  The human creative endeavor is what we should protect and need to protect.  Boiling down millions of hours of artists honing craft by stealing their work and importing it into to a probability engine is insulting and unworthy of copyright and no human creativity is involved.  If I told another person to write a book or paint a picture, I wouldn&#39;t receive the copyright, the writer and artist would.  Works generated by AI platforms are simply requests made millions of artists at once.",

AIs deliberately designed to make copies of artworks using artist own works to train on need to be banned and definitely shouldn&rsquo;t generate a copyright for their owners. <br/>The big thing between an AI and a digital drawing program that may turns words in pixels is first that the artist makes choices, there is a person making interpretations. The &ldquo;owners&rdquo; of AI will  admit that they don&rsquo;t know what collections the so called neural network makes - and they have little control over anything but the training set. Who is accountable when it comes to AI works? <br/>The fact that all AIs are trained using copyrighted work without permission, and that they wouldn&rsquo;t work without the corpus of currently copyrighted works makes all output fruit of the poisonous tree to borrow a term &mdash; unoriginal copying of a person&rsquo;s moral work. <br/>Finally AI has a very detrimental impact of the availability of work for real human creators and artists, the same creators and artists it stole from. <br/>So both the trained AI/neural network and the output unless proven free of unlicensed use of copyrighted work should not get a copyright. <br/>And training a for profit AI doesn&rsquo;t qualify as fair use. <br/>Of course I&rsquo;m an artist so I&rsquo;ve simplified the software aspect of AI. However I&rsquo;ve tried to summarize what I see is the issue with AI, based on real world problems of AI generated artworks over paying the cost of a commission, fake books under an authors name  listed on Amazon, and artist struggling to balance having images to share with real humans over a large enough watermark to stop them from being trained and stolen by an AI.

Writing, performing, making decisions of any kind doing any sort of job- this need to be super limited and expedite NOT replace. If you keep allowing careers to be outsourced to AI how will capitalism work? Your worker bees will won&rsquo;t have money to spend anymore. If you can&rsquo;t see the ethical ramifications of replacing people with algorithms maybe the financial implications to the economy will sway you. If you let AI replace people that live paycheck to paycheck then I hope AI replaces senators and lobbyists. ",

If we start to depend on AI-generated &quot;first drafts&quot; for our school curricula, our legal documents, our technical manuals (all things that are already happening), we will quickly find ourselves in a situation where we do not have a reliable standard for information at all, and it will be a Herculean task to find our way back again.

I&#39;ve never went to college for formal training nor have I ever needed to, my skills as an artist were completely self-taught and is a skill I have honed and crafted since I&#39;ve been able to hold a pencil and visualize just what I wanted to create. God has gifted me with this ability and I&#39;ve grown into someone who has worked in animation and illustration from sheer skill alone. Thousands of hours of my life has been poured into my craft. <br/><br/>Anything created by AI is all just fed and regurgitated work of the hard-working artist and writers who have constructed these skills for years of their lives. These frankensteinian creations have formed divisions among the consumers and the creatives. Studios and execs are using this technology to take work away from actual human lives in favor of saving a minuscule amount of their bottom line. It&#39;s both theft and exclusion. <br/><br/>Having art without a human soul makes no sense, because the essence of art is an extension of the person themself, and I don&#39;t want to live in a world where artist and writers can no-longer make a living off sharing parts of their soul. Machine and machine learning tools are soulless and the quality will suffer. AI needs to be put under strict regulation and companies should not be able to utilize stolen word-vomit as a means of creating and profiting. <br/><br/>Greed has it&#39;s grips in this country and I will not stand the consumption of the arts as another pillar that has fallen to capitalism. Make AI heavily regulated. Abolish it even.<br/><br/>",

The images, sounds, and words put together by artificial intelligence might mimic the expression of a person, but they are not genuine. At most, an AI that been trained to copy an artist, will produce a soulless imitation of the artist. When the artist has passed away, it&#39;s a very ghoulish thing to do. If we want quality art, we must respect the artists, and copyright is the very least that can be done to respect them and their work.<br/>As an artist, I can&#39;t compete against the staggering amount of content that can be generated by an AI, even if it needs to be edited by a person. No artist can. By giving AI any amount of legitimacy or protection will destroy art and artists.",

                "comment": "As a writer and consumer of information and entertainment there is a clear difference between creation and skillful regurgitation of news, fictional stories, humour, art and creative media.  AI consumes a thousand original &lsquo;man-made&rsquo; sources and puts forth a hybridization of all that it draws from.  It cannot by definition have an original take or do journalistic investigations.  It simply complies and reorganizes the work of others.  Thus, nothing it creates can nor should reasonably be granted a copyright.  To do so would rather violate the earned copyright of those who created the content it &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo;.  Moreover it should be charged for using these source materials from which it liberal draws from to render its product.<br/><br/>AI has huge potential in medicine and as research tool in law and many other fields.  All this should be taken advantage of.  However, corporations intent on using its ability to draw from existing copyrighted work of actual working people to avoid having to pay them for new work poses a threat not just to the meaning of a copyright but to the livelihoods it is supposed to protect and originality it promotes.

The technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little to no tools to protect themselves. Laws and regulations could help ensure that this technology is used in the most responsible way possible.

                "comment": "My name is Chase Jones and I am film/writing student at SCAD. My entire life I have been working to create powerful stories about ordinary people, the way that many of my heroes, such as John Hughes did. However, when you allow a Artificial being take on that task, art loses meaning. A screenplay, a song, a comic book, a painting even, about what it means to be human; to love, to laugh, to gain and lose, becomes a cheap imitation. A robot gathering data and imitating past films and representations of the human experience is the furthest thing from human&hellip;.it is the furthest thing from art. AI will have devastating impacts on our view of reality and ourselves as people. It may be able to take a sample of Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s voice and make him sing a new song, but it will never be able to replicate the way the people who wrote so many of Old Blue Eyes&rsquo; classic hits felt. Part of what makes art so powerful are the stories behind where a piece came from. Knowing what an artist went through that brought them to create something is part of a piece&rsquo;s impact. It is part of it&rsquo;s allure for many people. So, when a robot simply steals Snoop Dog&rsquo;s voice, and makes &ldquo;him&rdquo; rap lyrics that it generated based on what it thinks rap music sounds like, you lose that raw human aspect of the creative process. No emotion is involved, therefore it is meaningless. Another issue that is on the rise concerning actors in film, is the use of AI generated background actors. These actors would sell their likeness to the studio and receive little to no royalties for the use of their image, from now until the end of time. Meaning, if that actor makes it big, that studio will still own their image. This would allow them to place an AI generated version of the actor into any film they wanted, with no need to compensate that actor. In 1989, after the release of Back to the Future: Part Two, Crispin Glover, the actor who portrayed George McFly in the original, got into a salary dispute with Universal. Due to this dispute, Glover had not signed on to do the sequel, but George did make an appearance. Prosthetic molds of Glover&rsquo;s face, used to make him look middle aged in the first film, were worn by another actor. The studio thought no one would no the difference and there would be no issue. They ended up being half right. Glover was outraged, and rightfully so. In 1990, Glover sued Universal for the unauthorized use of his image, a lawsuit he won. Glover got a large settlement. So, as the U.S. Copyright Office, please tell me, if none of this was acceptable before AI, why should it be acceptable now? I beg of you, I and all the aspiring artists out there beg of you, regulate the use of AI and help us keep art human.",

                "comment": "1. I believe AI, when used for non-creative and manual intensive tasks, can be a hugely beneficial piece of technology. However, when it is used to generate &#39;creative&#39; pieces of work, it not only saturates the marketplace and infringes on people&#39;s intellectual property, but it can also cause massive damage to the integrity of creative work. Copyright is the incentive to create original works and it is the foundation of what holds the creative industry together. If AI works were allowed to be copyrighted, there is no logic anymore. It is entirely unsustainable to allow AI to be copyrighted, as it legalizes data laundering. For example, when an artist creates an original piece of work and owns the IP, it can be easily run through a dataset, to then be used by anyone and everyone. It unravels the industry and can cause massive disruption to contracts and trade. The only feasible way for AI to do minimal damage to this industry, is to only allow its usage for non-creative and tedious tasks.<br/><br/>9.1 Yes, consent should be required for both commercial and non-commercial uses. If a generated image was shared in the same community or portfolio site as the original artist, then it can cause damage to that person&rsquo;s business and income; It will saturate the demand for that work, causing damage to the original artist. The very existence of the AI image is enough to do the same amount of damage if it were commercial use. <br/><br/>9.2 An &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; approach is not feasible for individual copyright owners, as this requires a vigilance that is impossible to achieve. It would require the owner to find every single insistence of that work in datasets. This does not stop the issue of other people just adding the work back into the dataset, with the process having to repeat itself. The only feasible method would be to adopt an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; approach, where no work is added to the dataset unless stated by owners.<br/><br/>9.3 Yes. The process of gaining permission from owners in advance is not only possible but a much more ethical way of building a dataset. It would allow for a more fruitful discussion on copyright and the ethics of AI usage. It would avoid infringing on copyright and mitigate the risk of deepfakes. <br/><br/>9.4 The current remedy for infringement is no longer suitable. It does not provide enough protection and rights that will deter the unlawful usage of the owner&#39;s work. If infringement takes place, the rightful owner should have the powers to take the case to a body that can deal with the dispute quickly and effectively. The proof of ownership could be through metadata, blockchain or a series of facts that led to its creation. There should be tougher penalties to deter the behavior from happening again. <br/><br/>9.5 Yes. Creative work is unique to every individual. The work produced is under the agreement of specific terms. It should be argued that when a piece of work is made for a company under contract and is then used in a data set without consent, it leaves them liable for breach of contract. This gives the original creator leverage to object to its usage or hold the company responsible. <br/><br/>9.5 This should be obtained through contracts, specifying what work is allowed to be added to the dataset.<br/><br/>10.1 Yes. Similar to a freelance contract, it is feasible to hire individuals to provide or create work that can be added to datasets. <br/><br/>18 No. Even If the generative AI system is trained on the work of that individual, it is still using a generative algorithm that is producing work based on patterns and shapes, not on human input. The output is entirely automated and there is not enough control to allow for human intervention. If a piece of work was produced with the help of AI to automate the non-creative aspect of the work, only during the process and not the final output, then there is grounds for arguing that it can be copyrighted. <br/><br/>19 The core value of copyright should stay the same. There must be a certain level of human input for it to be subject to copyright. If a piece of work uses AI, then that person should not only prove that it was used non-creatively but also that the work could have been made without AI. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>20 No. Legal protection for AI generated material is undesirable and poses a threat to existing industries. It is not deemed necessary enough to develop AI technology. There is no evidence to support this to be the case.",

This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little to no recourse. Unregulated AI is absolutely a threat and something that needs to be treated as such. Reasonable regulations will protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. They are common sense. So please, help protect us. I am a United States citizen from the state of Missouri, if you need this for any reason. Thank you for your time.",

Using and the potential of copyrighting AI poses great threats to human creativity, jobs, creates too many opportunities for corporate abuse and exploitation of human labor/likenesses/intellectual and creative work. The federal government should take clear and precise action to prevent such abuse and exploitation now, before such use of AI becomes the norm and difficult to stop due to corporate power and institutional inertia. I am a history professor and I think that AI does not present an opportunity for students but rather another supposed tool that only serves to limit their capacity to think, analyze, and understand the world in which they live. The state of higher Ed has already become too corporatized and compromised by &quot;free market&quot; consultants that have turned education into a transactional system wherein teachers are to feed students data and they cough it back up with little thought or analysis, where they trade their time for a piece of paper, rather than a process of human engagement and learning that benefits not just teachers and students but communities as a whole.

                "comment": "All generative AI works rely on the input of previously created intellectual property, often from other individuals, and are therefore not meaningfully original works. There is no way to adequately cite individual works that contribute to the learning model or program, which means that products from that program utilize others&#39; IP without acknowledgement, compensation or other appropriate recognition. A model or program developed entirely from one&#39;s own intellectual property could feasibly generate copywritable works, but citation of the use of that tool should be required in publication. With all works derived from generative AI, citation should be clear, including the type of program used and where the program&#39;s dataset originated. AI is not capable of generating actual intellectual property, and therefore should not be considered a &quot;co-author&quot; or creative partner. Rather, it is a tool; artists do not cite Photoshop as a co-creator of art but typically acknowledge it as a tool used in creation. Not setting clear rules about citation leaves countless creators vulnerable to theft and exploitation.",

Not only do I believe that generative AI should not be copyrighted, I also believe that these AI tools should be regulated to use absolutely nothing in their databases without the consent of the human creator and putting an &quot;opt out&quot; approach is not enough for this, as it should be expected that the person who created the item would not want a machine to steal their creations and later take their jobs using plagiarism.",

The corporations who manage the datasets that A.I. draws on have openly admitted that they&#39;ve scraped billions of sources created by hardworking artists and writers, stolen the products of those creative labors, and then stored that stolen work in a database to continuously profit off the stolen work. This is a dangerous precedent that threatens the livelihood of anyone who creates professionally and hamstrings new creatives who are entering into the field. Please do not allow A.I., even output that has been &#39;edited&#39; by a human, to be protected by copyright laws, as doing so will only ruin the ability of workers in these industries to earn a living while enriching billion dollar corporations who wish to profit off the hard work of these individuals without paying them what they&#39;re worth. I would also ask that you look to the datasets these A.I. programs run on and shut them down for the most flagrant violations of copyright law in modern memory.

                "comment": "Copyright law protects the works of individuals and ensures a fair, competitive market for creatives. Artificial intelligence can only produce content based on data that was used to train it, including particular styles, references, concept, tone, use of color in art, etc. Individual human creatives often develop these skills independently and produce a unique voice based on how they interpret these different components. Thus far, there&#39;s been no precedent for AI to produce its own styles - it can only copy the styles of a particular creative or source material. Moreover, AI has no means to credit the creators of their original work, and can&#39;t cite references or inspirations like a human creative can. Copyright law should not apply to a computer program that&#39;s incapable of producing an original voice, can produce infinite variations of a concept without human intervention, and cannot self-validate that the work it&#39;s produced isn&#39;t copied wholesale from an existing work. Even the prompts provided to artificial intelligence must be inherently based on existing concepts and references, since the artificial intelligence must have equivalent training data that it can correlate the provided query to. While there&#39;s a place for artificial intelligence in the production of creative works (such as by generating reference concepts from a set of training data wholly owned by the creator), modern usage of artificial intelligence is too rudimentary to be considered original and not inherently derivative of an extant work.",

                "comment": "The world of ART is vastly appreciated and underappreciated.  For an artist to IMPROVE, their art form requires a work ethic for growth, and time to learn, and embrace inspiration all around them.  Artists (writers, designers, painters, cartoonists, etc.) can&#39;t grow and evolve if they have to also go wait tables at the local cafe down the street... b/c they can&#39;t afford rent anymore, thanks to Artificial Intelligence taking everything they&#39;ve worked for, without consent, and using it to create something easily thrown away, or something very profitable.  <br/><br/>Also artists won&#39;t use A.I. the most.  Executives, with minimal talent (at best) will.  It will rarely be a tool to help those already capable of creating art.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a SLIPPERY SLOPE... Before long, the inevitable conclusion will be less artists and LESS ART in our world.  All so lazy non-creative types can continue jumping the line, and standing on the shoulders of artists and teachers of history.  Our world is NOT better off, with less artists.<br/><br/>I urge you to PAY ARTISTS for their work, as A.I. manipulates it into whatever fleeting desires executives command.   Or, just outright, don&#39;t allow it.  If you can teach A.I. to draw, that might be different.  Right now, you&#39;re just teaching it how to steal.",

                "comment": "As an illustrator, cartoonist, general visual artist and creative professional, the use of generative AI in creative fields is highly concerning. I have already witnessed countless examples of artists not only having their portfolios of work scraped and used for AI data training without permission, but also many examples of artists&#39; names being specifically used as prompts to generate AI images resembling the work/style of these artists. In some cases, there has been a flood of non-consented AI images tied to an artists name, to the degree that searching for their work online pulls up the AI images along with their actual work, causing confusion over authorship. I firmly believe non-permitted use of data (writing, visual, audio, etc) for use in AI/machine learning programs that will no doubt be used for commercial or artistic purposes is wrong and a violation of copyright, and that these programs pose a real threat to creative expression and the ability for creatives to make a living. Also considering the generated works are not created with purpose by a human (to the degree that users of these programs often have trouble recreating a similar image twice because they have no control over the algorithms), I do not believe the generated works would be copyrightable, even if they were generated from public or consensual data. Thank you for your time.",

Copyright protects me if I create something new. If I try to sell a handmade version of a Disney character, I expect them to try to block me. Our laws have protected copyright for years. Turning the system upside down to allow a new type of copying the chance to be a product is unAmerican. I don&rsquo;t sell cassette recordings of radio broadcasts, I certainly don&rsquo;t remix other people&rsquo;s work into a compilation and sell that. Artists need to have some rights over their creations or they can&rsquo;t afford to make art. Please regulate AI and do not allow it to scrape data from stolen sources. Please do not allow AI to hold copyrights on slightly altered materials just because the software is new and flashy. ",

                "comment": "Artificial intelligence and anything created from it, or generated, should not be eligible for copyright. Generative AI effectively runs on plagiarism, AKA taking other people&#39;s works to create something else. This is not even transformative, as AI often just copies and pastes pieces of said work into a mesay jigsaw puzzle of writing, imagery, or music. Generative artificial intelligence is very difficult to even call &quot;intelligent&quot;. It doesn&#39;t generate things in a meaningful manner, such as watching chatGPT shows that generative AI becomes more inaccurate over time, rather than learning and becoming more accurate with time. The source is here: https://fortune.com/2023/07/19/chatgpt-accuracy-stanford-study/<br/><br/>Both in my experience as a creative person and a business person, and as a former academic, I&#39;ve watched generative AI be used mainly by my colleagues and students at my alma mater for a few things:<br/>1) to generate business decisions for them. At my private firm, an employee put in a bunch of business ideas and concepts into chatGPT for them to come up with business plans for them. They went through with the business plan, but only went so far as they realized that it was disastrous. My company also tried to replace all of our marketing analysts and copywriters with chatGPT, which also went poorly, and thankfully we never got rid of anybody.<br/><br/>2) to generate fake art, and try to copyright the fake art, and the real art that made it that is not their own, as their own to profit off of it. as posted in many places online, many people will throw in a myriad of art pieces into artificial intelligence, for them to generate art that is an amalgamation of all the art they put together, and it&#39;s hard to even call art. It doesn&#39;t make it well, and it looks soulless, but worst of all, these people will try to pass it off as their own, that they made it with their own hands specifically, and then try to profit off of it, even though all they did was type words into a box for 30 seconds. Even worse, they will try to copyright that work, along with another artist&#39;s actual creative work under their nose. <br/><br/>3) to generate academic answers and papers. At my alma mater, I&#39;ve heard from friends that continue to work or study at the university hearing about copious students using chatGPT to complete their homework for them, or to write papers for them. This defeats the entire learning process, and worst of all, almost everything in those papers and assignments are wrong. Worst of all, even if they are passable, people will try to publish that work on their own, and many of these papers get flagged for plagiarism, as the AI will just copy and paste paragraphs from other people&#39;s published work onto a document. Sometimes, people try to publish these academic papers privately, and some may try to copyright their work, which again is not even their own work, and is simply pieces of other people&#39;s legitimate work jumbled together in a way that is more than likely completely inaccurate.<br/><br/>With this together, artificial intelligence is a potentially dangerous tool, and a hack tool at that built off the backs of people who actually did their own work, only to be used to make money off of other people&#39;s hard work and to pass it off as their own without compensation. Since nobody is being compensated fairly for the use of their work, let alone compensated at all, let alone is their work being used with their consent, I do not believe that anything generated by supposed artificial intelligence should be eligible for any form of copyright, let alone making any profit off of it, whatsoever.",

Theft of copyrighted material to be ground into algorithms is far beyond what anyone intends when they put their work into the world, whether as something shared over social media or on an art hosting site, or as purchasable content such as published books. Nor should the public ever have cause to doubt whether the work they are engaging with is the result of human effort or of machine regurgitation. And finally, the idea that someone could copyright something computer-generated, solely because they got the machine to spit it out first, is simply absurd.<br/><br/>I hope this office:<br/>1) puts the strongest possible limits against the use of copyright-protected material in AI training sets<br/>2) requires that any content-sharing platform or publisher that wishes to share copyright-protected material for the purposes of training AI seek Opt-IN (not Opt-Out) permission to do so from each user<br/>3) continues to deny any copyright protection for AI-generated material",

They are designed to mimic human creative works and ultimately replace artists, writers, photographers etc with an autonomous vending machine. The idea that this should just happen without any consent from artists, writers, photographers etc. is utterly ludicrous.<br/><br/>In fact as I understand things the term &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; is related to a misreading (by AI advocates such as Andres Guadamuz) of EU Digital Single Market Directive (DSMCD) Article 4 which allows copyright owners to opt out of &ldquo;research&rdquo; and is not meant to be applied in connection to commercial use or machine learning for artificial intelligence. This is because it would violate Berne Convention Article 5 (2) where no formality is required for copyright protection. Having to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; would be an illegal formality.<br/><br/>The words &ldquo;commercial use&rdquo; don&#39;t even appear in article 4 of DSMCD. The words in article 4 are, &ldquo;for the purpose of text and data mining&rdquo; (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790)<br/><br/>NOT<br/><br/>&ldquo;for the purpose of commercial use&rdquo;<br/><br/>And NOT<br/><br/>&ldquo;for the purpose of Machine learning&rdquo;<br/><br/>Text and Data Mining has a legal definition in article 2 (2)<br/>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790<br/><br/>Thus it is clear that text and data mining means &ldquo;research&rdquo;. Not training AI systems!<br/><br/>So it is completely false that there is any copyright exception for &ldquo;commercial use&rdquo; in the EU for artificial intelligence training. The &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; provision is only for opting out of research.&rdquo;<br/><br/>So it&#39;s rather foolish to even discuss &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; or &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; with regards to commercial AI vending machines. Consent is always required as there cannot be any formality to &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; for copyright protection! Copyright protection is automatic on the creation of a work! No other conditions apply!<br/>",

                "comment": "Hello! I&#39;m a freelance &amp; creative writer and I&#39;m concerned about the implications of granting AI-generated work copyright status. First of all, these programs tend to scrape existing sources without consent, resulting in amalgamations of several authors who go uncredited. Second, even when AI does include quotes or citations, since these programs are predictive rather than truly intelligent they sometimes manufacture sources, actively perpetuating misinformation. Third, these programs are often used as a workaround to paying human writers since industrial-grade plagiarism is cheaper. Therefore, I&#39;m opposed to the granting of copyright to AI-generated works both on practical and ethical grounds.",

                "comment": "The use of computer programs generally referred to as &quot;AI&quot; in the common vernacular (eg; Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, etc.) are not actually true instances of Artificial Intelligence. They are instead tools built to pull samples of photographs, illustrations, audio, and writing en masse from the internet, regardless of the author/creator&#39;s permission in order to combine said instances in a single output similar to a newspaper collage. The problem with these programs is twofold: they are/were created with the intention of copying/imitating existing works by real people, and they are marketed as replacements for the type of people whose livelihood is taking photographs, making illustrations, recording audio, etc.<br/>Despite claims by proponents of &quot;AI&quot; programs, a majority of users of such tools utilize them to copy, impersonate, or otherwise plagiarize the work of others in an attempt to benefit financially by means of misleading others into believing such works were either created through legitimate means (such as digitally painting a picture by hand); or, in the event of pure plagiarism, impersonating an artist, photographer, actor, or writer outright. <br/>We are already seeing &quot;AI&#39;s&quot; intentional creation as a mimicry program being used maliciously against the American workforce: the AMPTP has stated their intention to use the ChatGPT program to scrape hundreds, if not thousands, of scripts in order to &quot;generate&quot; screenplays without the need to pay a real person or group of people to write a story for movies or television. Due to the way the ChatGPT program operates, it would be impossible to guarantee that the source material would be completely Creative Commons, and would therefore include scripts written by screenwriters and authors that did not give permission for their work to be utilized by the program, and whom would also not be compensated for the use of their work.<br/>There are dozens upon dozens of other examples of &quot;AI&quot; being used unethically, whether it be foraging guides with life-threatening misinformation being published on Amazon under false author names, or a deceased artist having their artwork ripped from their portfolio without the permission of their estate in order to sell prints on the internet. <br/>In its current form, and in the way it is currently being used, there is no ethical way to use &quot;AI&quot; programs. While advocates for &quot;AI&quot; will continue to make the claim that such programs will further progress in technology, writing, and art; their true intentions are to monetarily benefit from the legitimate works of others without any knowledge, skill, or contributions (fiscally or otherwise) of their own to such pursuits. <br/>Because of this, &quot;AI&quot; should be heavily regulated, if not outright prohibited in its current form, in order to protect the rights of people whose hard work, dedication, and entire livelihoods are at risk for being completely and entirely plagiarized for the benefit of wealthy corporations looking to further squeeze margins and scammers/bootleggers looking to make a quick buck.",

AI work is not built from nothing but from the years of labor of any creator the AI has been trained on. Even in the most &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; of uses, these models pull from across the internet at the whim of folks who seek to under pay and cut out artists. In my opinion, these users, leeching off of other artists and writers, should not be able to copyright these frankensteined works. They should also be held in contempt for feeding pieces Willy nilly into their models to create similar work! Please block AI users from copyrighting the work of others and from benefitting from their serious breech of others&rsquo; creativity.",

AI is trained on work created by visual artists, writers, actors, voice actors, and other artistic professionals (called &quot;artists&quot; from here on) as well as journalists and other writers. Using AI is weaponizing artists&#39; and journalists&#39; own work against them. <br/><br/>When anybody can make passable art with AI, there is less drive for consumers and corporations to pay artists for original work or original research. Artists, already often in tenuous financial circumstances, would be forced to give up their calling. <br/><br/>Under the rule of AI art, our culture would stagnate. New ideas and techniques would not be invented.<br/><br/>Many other trades and businesses would be eliminated, moving all work to computers. Live theater and dance would become things of the past, taking with them restaurants and (to a degree) fashion. No one would make paint. <br/><br/>Perhaps more troubling is AI&#39;s encroachment on journalism, cutting out the crucial layers of primary research and critical thought. Readers need well-researched information and human-pondered ideas, not algorithms. When we lose journalists, we lose truth, and we teach people that they don&#39;t need to learn to think for themselves, either.",

                "comment": "AI is built off of and trained on copyrighted materials, often without permission from the author or creator or their estate. As such, any work created by AI should not be considered an original creation and no copyright should be granted to the person seeking legal protection. This is much different than an author using a typewriter, or a graphic designer using a digital color pallet. <br/><br/>AI &quot;artists&quot; argue it takes time and skill to craft a work from one of these programs, but that is often because the program itself continues to spit out piece after piece of content until one of those is determined by that &quot;artist&quot; to be of sufficient quality for whatever project they are working on. Thus, if copyright is to be given, it should be granted to the algorithm, the AI itself, and not whoever created the prompt. <br/><br/>Therein is the problem, because that algorithm is built on a body of work that many people did not consent to or even dream of this being a possibility. Consider the author who&#39;s book was published, but has been digitized by a company and then scraped by an AI crawler. Short of never creating a work in the first place, there is no way that author would ever have been able to prevent their ideas and intellectual property from entering the library that an AI can pull from. <br/><br/>If the U.S. Copyright Office moves forward with copyrighting AI creations, there also must be in place a robust appeal process, by which artists and authors can file a claim and royalties or damages if they can prove the work contains elements of their art and works.

All models in play are trained on information that the original copyright holders did not consent to have used for training purposes. Companies such as X, Alphabet, and Meta are all rolling out AI systems designed to STEAL CONTENT from their userbase WITHOUT THEIR INFORMED CONSENT based on decades of material submitted to their platforms.<br/><br/>Speaking as a professional artist, the argument that &quot;AI is a tool&quot; is nonsense. If you take away Photoshop, I can still draw, as I have spent a lifetime developing that skill. If you take away an AI system, so called &quot;prompt authors&quot; cannot create anything.<br/><br/>There is also a safety concern. Currently on Amazon.com, AI generated books about fungus are being sold. These books can and will cause harm and death, as they describe certain poisonous fungus as safe for eating.<br/><br/>Allowing AI works to be copyrighted will create an economic incentive for more corporations to irresponsibly use AI instead of relying on the value of human experience and knowledge, which AI cannot come close to replicating. All works created by AI are created to simulate syntax, not meaning. There is no value worth protecting in these works. <br/><br/>",

This AI defaults to infringe upon the copyrights of many artists&rsquo; artwork as their works get feeds into the AI without their, either by companies or by individuals that are not the artist themselves. Furthermore, this AI can potentially hurts the quality of the entertainment for consumers, as certain bias can be contain among these unregulated data and there can be harmful and hateful content being  generated. Lastly, without regulation, this AI has become a enemy to human creativity as it robs the livelihoods of creatives. Thus, I strongly suggest the government that create legislation that prevent anymore acts of stealing from creatives and protect the basic rights of creatives.",

This is a grotesque misuse of what could be a powerful and brilliant technological breakthrough and the only thing holding it back from BEING a thing for good is proper regulation in terms of where it can get its content, how it is allowed to be used, and so on.<br/>Reasonable regulations must be put in place to protect copyright holders and working creatives and I believe they can be done so without hindering innovation.<br/>",

Copyright is intended to promote creative endeavors by individuals, but if AI generated content were to receive protections, it would promote the opposite to the benefit of corporations in the entertainment space who are already achieving record profits at the expense of sole creators. <br/><br/>Ignoring the very real problems of AI generated scripts and other content putting thousands of Americans out of work, there would be nothing to stop corporations running powerful AI engines around the clock to generate copyrighted AI content, which they could then use to threaten individual creators who happened to naturally create similar work. This probability is far from remote, as advances in computing power and AI are allowing such content to be generated at unprecedented speeds. In short, if you imagine the old adage about monkeys using typewriters to create Shakespeare, it will not take long for supercomputers using AI to ultimately generate  many thousands of Shakespeares, each demanding copyright protection at the expense of human beings.",

It cannot make anything on its own. Only an intelligent sentient being could do such a thing. It, like any other program or machine, must first be told what to do, and how to do it. That is not intelligence and those that have sought to steal the likeness of &quot;style&quot; for the sake &quot;creation&quot; are likewise unintelligent and cruel in their representation of their want. The have abused public trust in such a manner as few others before for the sake of their own profits. <br/>Only those possessed of a sentient freewill can truly craft artistically. These &quot;A.I.&quot; programs are naught but machines that must be told what to do and how it must be done, not unlike a car and a car has no rights. They exist as tools and as such must be regulated, but this &#39;generative A.I.&quot; is much worse for it is their makers intent to remove the human from creation. Instead of applying such tools to practical problems the programmers opted instead to try &#39;democratize&#39; a form of thought and execution that cannot exist without sentience, without being. What they have made is empty, collages mashed together and now these very tools are being used to create NSFW images of people who do not wish to be a part of it. How is that even allowed?<br/>The law must act and with great urgency to stop the development of &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; at all costs. ",

                "comment": "The art we create is what separates us from our beloved animals. Our need to create is driven by the need to heal, to tell each other stories, and to connect. In a world in which we are already so divided, the use of AI to take over our art and even our livlihoods leaves us without purpose, and I fear, more divided. The United Staes should be known as a haven for human expression. We currently attract the greatest minds in the world here because we support innovation, new technologies, and  freedom of expression. Instead of fearing the advancements other countries might make because of AI use, let&#39;s support our intellectuals, our artists, our humans to remain the leader in human advancement. The work of AI should not be able to have copyright, because it can only be the plagiarism of all human works that have come before. Let&#39;s use it for the good of humanity, of course. May it help us advance medical cures, but at the hands always guided by a human mind. If not, then what are we even here for?",

                "comment": "I am a professional working in the field of audio design &amp; engineering, with a specialty in dialogue, as well as being a voice actor. As such, I believe I am uniquely qualified to give perspective on why it is imperative that generative voice AI (and generative AI in general) be properly regulated before its usage gets out of hand and damage is done that cannot be reversed.<br/><br/>I have seen colleagues have their work and voices stolen to be fed into generative AI models, where their voices are effectively puppeteered and forced to say horrendous things that they never would have even considered saying themselves. The publicly available generative AI services that facilitate this kind of behavior always absolve themselves of any responsibility because there is currently no legal framework to prosecute this behavior. This is very common with characters in games, animated media, and films, and there is currently no legal recourse whatsoever if a person has their voice stolen in this or any other manner. Because these algorithms are a &quot;black box&quot; and very hard to study in a way that exposes how they were trained, it&#39;s very difficult to know whether a model was trained on copyrighted material or not, making it problematic to identify outside of obvious cases like sites designed to replicate the voices of specific people.<br/><br/>Given how easy it is to access these models and just feed whatever one feels like into them, there is serious danger in AI-generated media being allowed to be presented for copyright. If voices are generated from an actor who did not give permission in a project, it could potentially tarnish or destroy their careers and lives if words that they would never otherwise say were &quot;put in their mouth&quot;, so to speak, and presented in an official manner.<br/><br/>Due to the recency of this technology, there also often are no clauses at all in contracts that cover work that could be fed into a generative AI algorithm. This effectively means that there is no legal recourse for actors who have their voices fed into a generative AI algorithm without their permission as a result of being hired to work on a completely unrelated project.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it is not only irresponsible, but potentially dangerous to allow AI-generated work to be come copyrightable. I would implore you to consider the careers of both well-known and lesser-known voice actors, screen actors, and artists when weighing your decision on this. AI and similar technology should be used to ease productivity requirements so humans can focus on more fulfilling arts, not the other way around.",

As it stands, AI-generated products are simply scraped bits of human-created visual art, writings, music, and other works that are thrown in a blender. There is no work on behalf of the AI or the programmer running it that is original; everything is taken from something else without the consent of the creators of the scraped works and is presented as a completely new product. Anything AI-generated is no more the creation of its prompter than a wedding cake is the creation of the couple. There is no unique or original property of anything that is AI-generated, and thus there is no reason to offer it copyright as it is little more than the slapdash plagiarism that a student who wrote a book report at the last minute could do. I urge the US Copyright Office to refuse the protections and privileges of copyright to any AI-generated product. This privilege should be reserved solely for works created by a human, not something that a computerized blender spat out after devouring the hard work of others. ",

                "comment": "Artificial Intelligence is not only the product of stealing what already exists, often copywritten material, but it&#39;s a spit in the face to any and all creative outputs. The hours of hard work people put into their creations, only for people to take those, put them in some machine and replicate them fairly convincingly is a testament to how this is not a good thing. How long until works of art are created with 1:1 accuracy? This will put many creatives out of work, as freelance artists will have a tougher and tougher time finding work, and corporate studios will replace all the hard working writers, actors, animators, sound designers, because they will not only be able to save tons of money, which they do not need to do, these studios are raking in hundreds of millions of dollars every year, but will set a precedent in the future that this is okay, which it&#39;s not. How long until AI starts being able to take over jobs for politicians? Or AIs are going to be taking over for these corporate CEOs? This is a path towards a dystopian future where misinformation can be created far more easily and convincingly, but spread at an unprecedented rate. AI needs to be heavily regulated, and phased out of existence, because this can only lead to bad things for everyone. I please strongly implore the US Government to seriously consider this.",

                "comment": "AI can be helpful, but strict laws need to be in place to protect intellectual property and to protect the future livelihood of creators. For menial or incredibly arduous repetitive tasks that don&rsquo;t need creativity, AI can be utilized. But any creative content, idea property, writing, acting, performing, etc., should not be used with AI without strict rules, personal accountability, and human agreement in a situation-to-situation basis. If not strictly regulated from the beginning, lax AI laws will slowly corrode our economy and individuality, (which is a founding principal of our society as a country,) until things completely atrophy. We can always adjust later if things get too myopic but once freed, AI will be next to impossible to rein in if we don&rsquo;t create specific and detailed rules from the beginning. Thank you.",

                "comment": "Generative AI threatens the ability for artists to be compensated for their labor and create further art, and the copyright office must make rules to protect artists, irrespective of previous norms, because the world is fundamentally changing, in a shift as big as the change from analog to digital, and we need our copyright rules to change to reflect that. <br/><br/>In the digital age art is monetized via rent-seeking. This is because the cost of reproduction is essentially zero. Once someone has done the artistic work, performed the actual labor, the art is now in a state that it can be given to anyone who desires it at almost no additional labor or cost, but to distribute it at no cost means that the artist receives no compensation, and in the absence of other revenue sources, the artist will be unable to create further art because they will run out of funds. This is why we have copyright, and what the existing DMCA tries to establish. Only the artist is allowed to distribute their art, and this allows them a method to monetize their art, and earn compensation for the earlier labor to create the art. There are multiple ways to ensure artists in the digital age receive compensation for the labor of creating art, and copyright is the method the US has chosen.<br/><br/>Generative AI forces a change to this system, similar to how digital art changed the system. Now, by using generative AI, the labor can be removed from the initial step, by combining all of the labor of artists previous. The question of whether this combination is sufficiently transformative, or if reduction of labor is good or bad misses the bigger point, which is that art is special, and throughout history societies and governments have known that art made for arts sake is good. With the current state and trajectory of generative AI, the ability for artists to receive compensation for the labor to make their art will be reduced, and that is bad. This should be the focus of new rules and changes to existing rules, not any attempt at fairness or adherence to precedent. Two suggested methods are to prevent models and outputs from being copyrighted, to reduce their economic power compared to individual artists, or to directly tax copyrighted models and outputs for artists grants, to increase the economic power of individual artists, or a combination of both.<br/><br/>Please help art for arts sake.",

However, I have a huge problem with using my voice and/or likeness for AI without my permission and that is where I see the AI movement is headed.I do not consent for companies to use my data to train and use for AI. I&#39;ve seen so many of my peers&#39; likeness and voices used without their permission and we did not know about it. This is a safety issue, as someone can easily use it for evil and profit. I will only allow AI to be used as long as I consent and receive some sort of payment for every time my voice/likeness is used. But overall, I believe AI needs to be heavily regulated.   ",

The text generators do the same for text, it is now being revealed that text generators can regurgitate entire sections from books and the datasets include pirated books. The image generator datasets include private medical photos: Why are companies being permitted to build commercial models off private medical photos? 3D model datasets include models directly ripped from games and models that where illegally ripped or pirated from individuals small business owners. Why are commercial models being permitted to exist when they are based on pirated material like this? Is this the USA or China? The level of IP theft and privacy invasion here is similar to what China engages in. <br/><br/>Why is the government allowing tech companies to go above the law? What is the government going to do when tech companies destroy entire industries and cause millions of people to be unemployed? Will the government continue to provide tax subsidies to these out of control tech companies so they can steal the work of small business owners and destroy entire sectors of the economy, or is the government going to properly tax and regulate this technology? Is this the United states of America or the United States of OpenAI? ",

I have personally been a victim of this, as I&#39;ve seen my own works being &quot;claimed&quot; by other people for use in projects I did not create for nor authorize. The use of Artificial Intelligence has been one of, if not the, biggest obstacles of my professional career that I&#39;ve faced in the 15 years of professional illustration. Active job listings for proper freelance work have become highly competitive because the few people out there looking to hire a human artist have become scarce as more and more companies turn to use stolen assets of AI to &quot;make&quot; works. This issue goes beyond just art, and into scenarios of AI voice and video, which lead further into the rabbit hole of what it&#39;s used for and how well it gets away with it, including creating fake news images or even pornographic imagery of real people who don&#39;t consent to the use of their likeness in those situations. Please put a stop to this once and for all and relieve thousands of people who continue to be actively hurt.",

                "comment": "1. AI generated works over saturate and devalue any type of creative work. People who work in the creative industry already know too well that it&#39;s hard to make a living for a lot of creatives and companies will take shortcuts wherever possible. Throwing genAI works into the mix will make the lives of creators even harder because it&#39;ll flood the market and devalue any type of creative work. It&#39;ll lead to job loss because now a company has less incentive to hire more artists, because now they can generate whatever they want with a click of a button. It is already affecting jobs and if copyright will be granted to those works it&#39;ll only get worse and ruin the complete creative industry<br/><br/>GenAI that has been fed with countless of copyrighted work and the whole library of artists everywhere now is now suddenly a competitor to those artists because the algorithm can spit out similar work as specific creators completely ruining the selling point of an artists ability to market themselves.<br/>There is no benefit to creators. The only people benefiting from this are the companies offering the genAI services and own the data sets. Creative companies will profit because they now get more output for a fraction of the cost and needing to hire less people.<br/><br/>In almost all cases where creative work is used licenses/copyright/consent has to be bought beforehand. So why should training genAI which only has one purpose &quot;Replacing of human workers&quot; be an exception here? The lifelong work of creatives is actively being used against them without consent from neither the creative nor the client it was created for.<br/><br/>2. The sheer amount of work genAI can spit out in hours drowns out any competition.<br/>Also no other market feeds on human work and data like genAI does. This is an unprecedented event in copyright history.<br/><br/>4. House of Commons Culture, Media &amp; Sport Committee Connected tech: AI &amp; creative technology Eleventh Report of Session 2022&ndash;23 (https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/41145/documents/201678/default/)<br/><br/>5. Since right now any sort of training is done under the fair use defense. Fair use needs to be specifically addressed that it doesn&#39;t cover the use of copyrighted material for training of generative AI.  We have multiple instances where training has been done under the goal of &quot;research&quot; but then those data sets are being used by corporation to fuel their commercial products. (Data Laundering)<br/><br/>6. Bots are searching and scraping the web indiscriminately. (Even if websites have a robot.txr to tell a bot that they don&#39;t allow scraping there are multiple bots and newer bots who disregard that. So it is up to each website owner to research and write new exemption to those specific bots don&#39;t scrape their site. But at that point the damage is already done since the data has already been acquired)<br/>Also people are targeting and scraping specific creatives to use their works for fine tuning already existing data sets to mimic specifically certain artists. (this website is one of the more famous ones: https://civitai.com/ )  Multiple artists have already asked for their stuff to be taken down but with no success.<br/><br/>6.1 So far the biggest data set done for research is LAION 5B which includes billions of images scraped from the internet (not just creative works but everything from selfies, xrays, porn (illegal or not), violent images etc.)<br/><br/>6.2 As of right now there are consensual licensed works from creators offered for training. Adobe says their genAI (Firefly) is only trained on legit works but multiple artists have cried out that their work is being used without consent. Adobe has also in the past weeks openly display failure to comply to their own rules by selling genAI art that mimics famous artists on their stock site.<br/>(https://pioneersperspective.com/innovation/ahead-of-a-full-firefly-launch-internal-documents-show-adobe-wrestling-with-how-to-spot-ai-images-how-to-pay-creators-for-training-data-and-a-possible-opt-out/)<br/><br/>7.3 No it&#39;s not. That is why opting out doesn&#39;t work.<br/><br/>8. I believe there should be no exemption cause the training aspect is too easy to abuse for anything else and make it commercial.<br/><br/>8.1 Training as a whole should not be protected under fair use. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s at the start or end during the fine tuning process.<br/><br/>8.3. As mentioned for point 8. Fair use should not apply at all for training of AI. In every instance consent by the copyright holder(s) needs to be required.<br/><br/>8.4 genAI is competing the same market as the people it acquires the training data from. This already goes against any type of fair use argument.<br/><br/>8.5(see 8.4)<br/><br/>9. Opt in is the only things that works. Creatives are already busy with their work. It&#39;s impossible to keep up with any new DATA SET and see if their work was used. Also once trained data can&#39;t be forgotten. So opt out doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s also impossible to prove if the opt out has been honored.<br/><br/>18. No copyright for AI<br/>",

                "comment": "Generative AI today uses the results of human intelligence and creation (without permission or compensation from those creators) to produce outputs that seek to replace the work of those same creators in the marketplace. The owners of the companies that built generative AI also seek to have the outputs of those machines declared to be copywriteable. <br/><br/>It is clear in the history, legal precedent, and original intent of copywriting that only a human creator can make something that is copywriteable. That standard should not change, as it is intended to encourage the efforts of human creativity, intelligence, and hard work in order to better our society and benefit the market. Assigning that value to the output of a machine would undermine the basic foundation of copyright.<br/><br/>Additionally, allowing generative AI to utilize copywritten material without permission from or compensation to the copyright holders in such a way that financial benefits flow to the generative AI creators and actually *replace* jobs that may have otherwise gone to the original copyright holders is not in line with fair use, nor is it of benefit to our society. Generative AI companies should get the permission of the copyright holder for the use of any copyrighted material if they are going to receive any financial compensation (directly or indirectly) for the use of that material.",

                "comment": "The Constitution states that the function of patents, copyrights, and trademarks is &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.&quot; For three reasons, this should not apply to AI-generated works. First, &quot;AI&quot; is nothing of the sort; it does not think in any meaningful sense, merely rearrange the data fed into it in statistically likely ways. It does not look at existing works and get inspired to make its own contribution; it rearranges elements of them to produce inherently derivative works. Second, all works are the products of choices made by people. Whether an individually authored novel or painting, or a film produced by a crew of hundreds, artworks are always the product of countless choices, big and small, made by people. But the person who tells an AI to generate an image is not making those choices; they are contributing no more than the person who commissions an artist to create a particular image--and it is still the artist who holds the copyright, not the commissioner, unless they have a contract transferring that copyright, which again acknowledges that it by default belongs to the artist. But the AI is not the one making those choices either--it is taking the choices made by the artists of the work in its database, with no thought of its own because it is incapable of thought. Neither the person using the AI nor the AI itself is the rightful holder of the copyright of the resulting image--as a derivative work of all the images in the AI&#39;s database, it should rightly be considered uncopyrightable. The same holds for texts, films, or any other work that might be generated by an AI.<br/><br/>Finally, there is that first phrase: &quot;to promote the progress of [the] arts&quot;. Remember again that AI can only rearrange what already exists; it cannot create anything truly new. But it is cheaper by far for publishers, studios, and other distributors of works to pay for AI generated works than to pay a living wage to artists and authors, and will grow cheaper still as technology advances. If such works are copyrightable, it will cease to be difficult to make a living as an artist of any type; it will become impossible. And as so-called AI can generate nothing truly new, that will necessary slow progress in the arts to a crawl. Imagine a world in which Mozart had to work at McDonald&#39;s 60 hours a week in order to make rent, and could only compose with the little time and energy that remained; that is the world that the proponents of &quot;AI art&quot; are proposing we create, a world of statistically-generated reshufflings of existing work in which virtually nothing genuinely groundbreaking can be created. Please, please rule that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted.",

                "comment": "AI work is generated by taking bits from actual human authors. Sometimes this is something that cannot be protected under copyright, but people shouldn&#39;t be able to make profits or gatekeep content that has been created by someone who spent time and effort and love creating something to share with the public just to enrich our communities. It&#39;s unconscionable to allow AI learning to take from actual content creators without their express permission, to then spit something out using their work. It takes away commissioned work from artists, it decreases the chances for actual human work being published, etc. The biggest issue I have is what is taken by AI tech companies for the machine learning aspect. People who use AI generators and then try to capitalize off of it are stealing from the creators and putting no effort into the product. They shouldn&#39;t be rewarded. In the example with the graphic novel, the writing should be subject to copyright but the AI generated art should not. If someone wants art that they can own, they should either learn to make it themselves, or pay those who have invested time and effort into learning how to do it. There has to be federal protections for creators.",

Though I respect the technology behind artificial intelligence, it&rsquo;s clear to me as a writer and digital artist that stricter regulations are necessary to curb the existential threat AI poses to art itself. To that end, though I am not a policymaker, I have some suggestions:<br/>1) Full transparency in source data and data harvesting methods. I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s current form, many commercial AI are trained by scraping the internet without consent or even knowledge from artists. AI developers should be transparent about the data included and the sources of said data, so that artists can have an easier time requesting their works removed from the training set.<br/>2) No copyright on generated material utilizing copyrighted works. I feel as though this one is straightforward, as generating a script or image based on someone else&rsquo;s work is just bootlegging with extra computing power.<br/>3) Job security for workers affected by AI. Again, a fairly obvious one, given actors and writers alike are striking due to Hollywood wishing to replace them with AI generated writing and AI generated likenesses. Though you can&rsquo;t quite regulate whole sectors of labor, there needs to be protections in place so corporations can&rsquo;t pay peanuts to replace whole swathes of the workforce.<br/>As mentioned, I am not a policymaker and these are all suggestions. However, regardless of what form this change takes, *something* needs to change. Our current laws around AI are simply incompatible with modern labor and any form of creative integrity. I do not know perfectly what steps are necessary, but something must change!",

                "comment": "As a former AI programmer and current fantasy novelist, the explosion of hype around LLMs and content creation is a strange confluence of my interests.  It&#39;s something I follow closely, though my technical expertise is a bit out of date by now.  In general, I think the AI companies need to be restrained; they&#39;ve taken a &quot;let them sue us&quot; approach to the rights of copyright holders that, if rewarded, risks undermining the basis of the system creatives rely on to make a living.<br/><br/>First and most importantly, the vast datasets used for training LLMs are an open abuse of copyright.  The resulting model contains (albeit in a very lossy way) all the works used to train it -- easily shown by entering a sufficiently popular work (for example, &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;) into an LLM image generator, which returns a good approximation of the original.  I don&#39;t pretend to be a copyright law expert, but it seems clear that changing the format of something (for example, scanning an image) is not a license for infringement, even if the new format can&#39;t precisely recreate the original.  (JPEG compression, for example, is &quot;lossy&quot;, so a PNG converted into a JPG cannot be converted back into an identical PNG; but the JPG is still the &quot;same&quot; image as the PNG.)<br/><br/>The result is a piece of software that clearly has economic value, created from the bits and pieces of the works that make it up.  We cannot be deceived by scale alone.  A &quot;model&quot; trained on a single book, answering all queries with quotes from that book, would presumably be infringing; the fact that the model includes tens of millions of books should not be a free pass.  There is nothing IN the model except its training data.<br/><br/>The AI companies cannot be given a pass simply because contacting and obtaining permission from rights holders would be time-consuming and difficult, either.  Their infringement does not become less damaging just because they&#39;ve already done it and it was expensive; any output from the current set of models is tainted by the illicitly acquired inputs.  There is a vast amount of data available to use free and clear (in my own AI work, for example, among others we used the &quot;Enron corpus&quot;, entered into the public record during the trial) and a great deal more that could be acquired in a straightforward way.  (For example, stock image providers control rights to huge numbers of images.)  Complaints that recreating models without sweeping up everything on the internet amount to saying that distinguishing between copyrighted and non-copyrighted material is too expensive and time-consuming; it&#39;s hard to imagine the same argument succeeding from, say, the owner of a free music download site.  Model developers must be made to acquire permission for copyrighted work on an opt-in basis, and openly post the list of works that were used in the creation of the model.<br/><br/>As to whether the outputs of an LLM can be copyrighted, I have less applicable knowledge.  I will say it doesn&#39;t seem like the act of sorting through many potential outputs and choosing one is an act of creation of the kind that is normally rewarded by copyright.  If I had access to the proverbial infinite monkeys with typewriters, and scanned their output until I found a chunk more-or-less identical to a popular novel, it seems wrong that either I or the monkeys could claim the result as our own work.<br/><br/>In a larger sense, the purpose of copyright has always been to reward the creative acts that enrich our culture generally and allow individual creatives to earn a living.  In many cases this is an egalitarian, decentralizing goal -- the copyright of a novice painting their first picture is just as valid as that of a big corporation.  LLMs, improperly regulated, have the potential to profoundly reverse that goal.  By their very nature they are extremely centralizing, requiring so much computing power and storage to create that only the largest and wealthiest entities can hope to build one.  If ownership of an LLM becomes a license to infringe the rights of creators, a tremendous amount of artistic and cultural power will fall into the hands of a tiny group of unaccountable entities.  In order to avoid this, the owners of these models must abide by the same rules as everyone else, and negotiate and pay appropriately for the work that they require to build their businesses.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.",

Especially copyrighted material belonging to individual artists or artists unaffiliated with a specific company/corporate entity. To train off of such works is blatant theft. This may be different were an artist to give explicit written permission for their work to be used for AI training purposes, but it should otherwise be disallowed. AI works are also undeserving of being copyrighted. At most, people generating AI works are entering pieced together word prompts which are then used to generate a work based upon the previous works of other human artists. That in itself should not be enough to automatically grant copyright to the person who used AI to generate the work. Stringing together correct prompt combinations to ensure the desired result is not work worthy of copyright. There is no ethical granting of copyright to any kind of media generated by AI which was trained off the backs of working creative humans, whom in many cases reject the use of their art to be used for AI training. AI trained to mimic specific voices/art styles/etc. of current or previous existing artists, actors, or other creatives/public figures should be considered a breach of unfair competition legislation in applicable jurisdictions.",

I don&#39;t understand how GenAI has come this far, on this scale, with so little legal repercussion on that end. Are we, as people who have had our assets stolen, compressed, stored and regurgitated into unrecognizeable patchworks, supposed to all individually take legal action against every single GenAI project that uses our work. Making a living as a freelance artist is already notoriously difficult as it is, but this might just be the nail in the coffin for the careers of many.<br/><br/>",

                "comment": "Hello,<br/><br/>I am a voice actress. AI threatens my field of work everyday. In just the last week, I and numerous other people I work with have lost paying work to AI voice over. On top of that, I&#39;m an artist. I used to make a lot of money off of my commissions. I haven&#39;t even sold one commission since AI artwork became available to the public. The works of thousands of artists, most likely including myself, are being scraped from online sites and being mashed together to form works being used commercially whilst paying those artists nothing. We are being robbed of opportunity. As an actor and an artist, I get to see both sides of this - as actors, our performances, voices, even our bodies are being scanned and stolen with AI. It feels like everyday I see another voice actor asking for AI videos of characters they voice be taken down. These videos range from music covers to profanity to racism, sexism and other forms of hate. Not only can this cause an actor&#39;s image to be tarnished, this can also cause an entire company&#39;s image to be tarnished. I want this to end.<br/><br/>Overall, I have high hopes that this will blow over, as all of these things do. People want to see people. The pro AI crowd are a vocal minority and nothing more.<br/><br/>Thank you",

                "comment": "Generative AI as it exists now relies on the massive theft of artwork without credit, consent, or compensation&mdash;a theft that has already been carried out. Its purpose is to replace human artists, depriving income from the very people upon whom it preyed. Permitting AI artwork from these models to be copyrighted would mean denying the validity of individual artists&#39; copyrights in order to allow art thieves to profit from their work; it privileges wealthy tech industry corporations at the expense of everyone else. It would be erroneous to classify these works as being made without human involvement, because their datasets rely entirely on artwork stolen from human creators. Claims that generative AI is &quot;creating new artwork&quot; is hucksterism, deceptive language employed by tech entrepreneurs to sell their product.<br/><br/>The most common argument I&#39;ve seen leveled against artists is that generative AI &quot;learns&quot; from the artwork of others, just like human artists do. This is a gross mischaracterization of the creative learning process in humans, simultaneously elevating a fiction to mask how present-day generative AI actually operates and dehumanizing artists and the art tradition humanity has practiced since prehistoric times. AI does not take into consideration the meaning of a work, the philosophies behind the artists whose work is being emulated, the imperfections that inevitably result even when human artists fully intend to replicate a work exactly. Even when a human artist engages in collage, an art medium that relies on using existing pieces of art, the message is frequently altered from its source materials&#39; original intent. The history of collage shows that it is very political, relying on subversion, irony, and other expressive tools to convey its message&mdash;an internal analysis that generative AI simply is not capable of. Art is, by definition, created by humans as a form of human expression. Allowing tech corporations to copyright AI-generated pictures is another step toward dehumanizing us as a species for the monetary profit of a relative handful of people not involved in the creative process. <br/><br/>We have already witnessed wealthy corporations like Disney using their power to alter copyright law in their favor. Now we&#39;re facing the prospect of wealthy tech corporations, having openly committed the largest art heist in human history, being rewarded for their crime. Will the U.S. Copyright Office defend the rights of individual creators, or will it yield to moneyed interests yet again?",

Regardless of who owns the equipment with which art was created, if a human made no creative contribution to the works, then there is no copyright to be claimed.<br/><br/>In terms of if telling a machine what you want is enough to constitute &#39;creative contribution&#39;, it has been shown in other copyright cases that that is not enough. In making a request or buying a commission for art, unless copyright/rights of ownership is given to the customer, the owner of the copyright is still the artist, not the person who wrote out what they wanted (exactly as one would write out a request to an AI machine). In terms of going to get a tattoo, unless the customer actually contributes to the art and or style of the tattoo being made or gets the copyright signed over to them, then the copyright still belongs to the tattoo artist. <br/><br/>From Americans for the Arts: <br/>&quot;Who owns the copyright for a public artwork?<br/>The artist retains all rights under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 USC Section 101) as the sole author of the work for the duration of the copyright. The duration of copyright in the United States is currently the life of the author, plus 70 years. <br/> Title to the artwork passes to the client or commissioning agency/organization upon their written acceptance of and payment for the work, but copyright belongs to and remains with the artist. In other words, although the client may &ldquo;own&rdquo; the work of art, the artist who created the work owns the copyright, including all ways in which that artwork is represented (photos, video, ads, logos, branding), other than in situ (on-site documentation photos).&quot;<br/>",

The lack of regulations have permitted AI to do damage against researcher and artist, but also other person in other field. It&#39;s stealing our right, mostly copyright of our products. Unregulated AI is a huge threat because of that, and it&#39;s threatening to my studies and the fruit of my research (hours and hours of research) that can be stole without I can say anything. I don&#39;t want to publish my work online because of that. I understand the need for innovation but it shouldn&#39;t threaten copyrights and working creatives.",

                "comment": "I&#39;m a software developer who studied artificial intelligence at West Virginia University as part of my graduate studies in computer science. I am also a commercial writer of fiction who writes  bespoke works of prose for small amounts of money. I mention this as I feel like I have a useful perspective on both the technical and creative aspects of artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>For every creative work, there is an idea that has a causal relation to each step taken to produce the work, and to attempt to realize the idea. Generative program do not use an analogous process. They do not understand the prompts given to them, nor do they understand why what they generate purportedly satisfies the prompt. This is illustrated quite easily if you ask for a picture of a human hand, as most generative programs do not reliably produce five-fingered hands.<br/><br/>A prompt is something written by a human, I do think a prompt is has intellectual property rights associated. The image or text generated from the prompt, however, should not, in the same way that animals and natural processes do not have intellectual rights to artifacts. <br/><br/>It&#39;s trivial to trick artificial intelligence to replicate any data it is trained on, and it may do so accidentally without human awareness. This is a risk most people do not factor for when posting art on their own personal website, or when they give permission for their art to be printed in a magazine that might be archived and later scraped as a training set. We should assume artists are retaining the right to refuse for their works to be used in a training set unless specified otherwise, in much the same way we assume they reserve the rights to control whom reprints their works. <br/><br/>As mentioned before, a person can certainly commit copyright infringement with generative AI just as readily as they might with paint, or with a pencil, or with a typewriter. All normal liabilities should attach.<br/><br/>In regards to a particular person&#39;s style, this seems to be an issue of trademark rather than copyright. If there exists a likelihood of confusion for the source of the artifact, that&#39;s one kettle of fish, but as humans are free to imitate the masters, they continue to be free to do so with the tool of generative AI.",

                "comment": "1) How AI models should use copyrighted data in training:<br/><br/>AI models should only use copyrighted data with the permission of the original copyright owner with an opt-in methodology (not opt-out). There also needs to be full transparency from now on with where exactly AI models get their data otherwise AI-generated material from that model should always be deemed uncopyrightable.<br/><br/>2) Whether AI-generated material can be copyrighted even without a human involved:<br/><br/>Human creativity is essential for a piece of Artwork. I particularly like the judge&#39;s ruling on this case against AI-generated Art: https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/19/23838458/ai-generated-art-no-copyright-district-court?fbclid=IwAR1rJY_ZzQfv3vmhMyoNIx2FKo20NjU1EAxpS06F8yqpOf7tThfsqQ6eAlY <br/>Especially the part in the transcript about Photography, I will link a screenshot of that.<br/><br/>3) How copyright liability would work with AI:<br/><br/>I believe the companies behind the AI models should always be the ones held liable for using Copyrighted data and not the AI-Art Prompter. If, in the rare exceptions, where the AI-Art Prompter is clearly/intentionally making a derivative work (for instance through an image-to-image interface) then standard liability should apply to the AI-Art Prompter.<br/><br/>4) How we should handle AI possibly violating publicity rights:<br/><br/>It will indirectly help if the Copyright office finds the companies behind AI models liable for using copyrighted data to prevent violating rights of publicity. Not only would cracking down on the Copyrighted datasets do right for the Original Creators, it would also help regulate publicity rights indirectly.",

This is different from an artist seeking inspiration from another&#39;s work because an artist will always be inserting their own talent and sapient creativity into their piece, whereas an AI has no sapience, no true creativity, and is mashing together artworks in a copy-paste (albeit a complex version of it) from different sources as an amalgamation to try to create the image the user requested from the prompt. This takes away jobs from artists and writers who not only have fewer job opportunities as people attempt to replace them with a poor facsimile of creativity, but they can&#39;t even get proper compensation when their own art is being used to make these machines function. AI could function if the datasets were Opt-in only (NOT opt-out, that&#39;s asking for users to be unaware their work is being used and how), and if it were required that artists whose art gets used in commercially-made AI art gets proportional compensation. You could even have it that art that&#39;s used for certain purposes has different compensation requirements so that, say, a non-artist could cheaply use AI to make a mock-up piece to help convey to a hired artist design aspects they expect for an expensive commissioned piece to help save time and improve communication between parties, but so long as the AI art is never used in publication, it&#39;s not subjected to higher royalty rates.  <br/><br/>To be entirely clear, I do not think AI art should be able to be copywritable because the AI work product was made by a machine, a non-human, and therefore there was no sapience or creativity behind it. At best the person behind the prompt is suggesting to the computer what to do and then it&#39;s up to the computer how to interpret the request.",

This technology has already done damage due to lack of regulations, and copyright holders currently have little/no recourse. Unregulated AI is a threat because it uses content without permission to create new content, which then threatens the livelihoods of those who created the original content that is being scraped for data.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure we use this technology in the most responsible way possible. Also, reasonable regulations protect copyright holders and working creatives without hindering innovation whatsoever. It is only reasonable, common sense, and just that AI should adhere to copyright and not use source material without permission.",

If AI were to fully take hold, I would be out of a job, completely.<br/><br/>AI-generated works, be it writing, illustration, or otherwise, should not be permitted any ground in copyright. Most, if not all, AI-generative algorithms are trained on stolen and/or copywritten works, rendering them nothing more than derivative (if not outright plagiarized) works to begin with.<br/><br/>By allowing AI-generative works any status even close to the work of real human beings, you would be sending corporations a message telling them it&#39;s okay to fire their workers and replace them with these AI models, which, I&#39;ll add, has already been happening all over various media industries. Tell anyone who would use AI to turn a profit that they will hold no copyright, their &quot;work&quot; will not be protected, and, further, any work found being trained on the work of real people who did not give consent is a crime.<br/><br/>I&#39;m fully aware that &quot;whether or not it should be criminalized&quot; is not the question, here. But it truly ought to be criminalized. It is theft. Anyone with a whiff of knowledge on the topic knows it&#39;s theft. Nothing about these AI models is ethical. Nothing about them is conducive to the progress of any media industry. Nothing about them should be allowed.",

It is absolutely unethical to allow them to continue production of imagery, let alone be granted copyright for imagery produced utilizing stolen copywritten material and personal work of countless artists. The proposition itself is insulting to the myriad peoples across every discipline of creative work who have been robbed without recourse by shiftless technological grifters attempting to bypass the human beings behind creative fields - to take the artists out of the production of art. <br/>I could not be further opposed to the idea of copyright status being granted to anyone or anything produced by AI. This proposition and open forum is entirely unecessary given that this topic was already solved in the 2014 ruling against copyright claims by British wildlife photographer David J. Slater when it was decided that only works created by a human being could be considered for copyright protections. AI generators are not human beings and thus it should already be decided that they cannot, and shall not, be given copyright protections for their generated works.",

                "comment": "To Whom It May Concern, <br/>Thank you for taking a moment to read my thoughts on A.I. -- I&#39;ll be brief as I&#39;m sure you will have many wonderful thoughts from humans and numerous transmissions from robots to sift through. First, I am a WGA writer currently on strike and one of the &quot;hills to die on&quot; is about A.I. -- in the hands of greedy studios it is a way to replace artists, writers and performers. Even if a work of A.I. is eventually polished by human hands in some way, the product is plagiarism. As a comic book creator, we&#39;re wary of AI art - it&#39;s poor quality, like silly putty lifting an image off a comic page. The A.I. that the corporations will turn to &quot;mix-up&quot; elements and regurgitate a story will have been trained on my collaborations. I DO NOT CONSENT to this. And in all my indicia moving forward, I am expressly prohibiting the training of A.I. on my collaborations. It may be a long time, if ever that A.I. can break your heart or make you belly laugh, but the forces of capitalism will not care for quality -- indeed they do not call us writers most days, and they do not even call the product &quot;story&quot; any more they refer to it as content. An attempt to untether it from any responsibility to pay the artists for its use and reuse. We need strong A.I. protections -- and not just in the copyright space. Below please find an example of my new indicia expressly prohibiting my creations from being trained on A.I. If someone wants to train their A.I. on my story -- what is my story worth? We don&#39;t know the answer to that question yet. Thanks again! -- Gerry Duggan ",

It also means that people will keep repeating the same faulty information again and again without looking into the details because of how &#39;easy&#39; it is to get what they consider reliable information.<br/><br/>Regulations could help ensure that we use this technology in the most responsible way possible.",

I believe all books for children created with AI should be marked as such explicitly and in plain text. I believe they should all be public domain. I believe AI tools should be forbidden from training on works not in the public domain. This is for the good of the reader, their parents, and finally all authors.",

There are books about foraging mushrooms and plants being made with AI causing bodily harm to people. Doctors and lawyers are graduating college with AI, meaning they&#39;re not studying, causing more harm to the world. People are using unregulated software for everything and it needs to be regulated or demolished. AI is replacing hundreds of thousands of workers and damaging the economy as our services are no longer being needed, meaning there&#39;s less commerce being exchanged. AI NEEDS to be regulated.",

Much of that content is copyrighted material where the creators do not see any monetary compensation for. Currently, as you are aware, the WGA and SAG/AFTRA are on strike to ensure that AI is limited or non invasive (at best) in the creative process. Studios have even suggested that people sign over their voices and likenesses in order for studios to use those voices and likenesses in perpetuity. If AI remains unfettered, prior copyright guidelines will be found moot. As AI improves and usage expands it is imperative for Congress to look at it&#39;s current uses and anticipate future use to protect content creators as well as the IP of actors. ",

As most AI is basically just databases assembled via web-scraping and theft, any work it creates is a work of theft. Maybe some human creators wish to opt in to their work being used for AI creations, but the vast majority of them weren&#39;t given a choice in the matter. Machine learning at its core can prove extremely helpful when it comes to other fields (especially in the sciences), but should be kept away from art and artists. ",

If not for everyone who has up to this point worked hard at their craft. It should just be stuff we can use for point of reference/knowing it isn&rsquo;t truly ours. On top of the fact how will you ever know. If it isn&rsquo;t stealing? Think of an AI made script or book. Any writer rushing like that. May not even research it. What is inside it. Then you realize this AI literature/script/novel. Has entire bits of star wars or something in it. Word for word but some random person notices. AI is too stupid overall. I&rsquo;ve had to correct chat gpt that one number was greater than another. This is gonna just be madness if you allow this to stand with real writer work. Same goes for the art really. ",

                "comment": "The issue of copyright and AI generated work is indeed a complicated matter. AI generated work requires training on human material. The problem is that said training on human material has included countless copyrighted images and texts. Most of the creators of said images and texts did not explicitly given permission for them to be used to generate content. A creator can use several resources to find out whether or not their work has been used to train AI. The datasets that have been used for training AI were not assembled by hand from solely images that permission was given for to be used in order to train AI. As a result, artists have overall rejected AI generated art. AI generated content is part of the reason why Hollywood writers and actors are on strike. Studios want AI to be trained on what they do so the writers and actors can be replaced by AI, leading to many people at risk of losing not just their jobs but their careers. <br/><br/>So should AI generated content be protected by copyright? The answer is no. It&rsquo;s not original work or a creation of the mind. It only exists due to human made content being inputted into datasets with or without permission. It is often copyright infringement because of the lack of consent for how much human content is inputted without any kind of permissions or consent. Derivative human created works such as fan art and fan fiction arent protected by copyright in the same way as original works but they are still works of the mind created by people. <br/><br/>AI artwork and text does not have artistic integrity because it was made by machine. It lacks any originality or emotion no matter what it looks and/or sounds like. When you use ChatGPT to write for you, it takes a dataset consisting of the entire internet from its beginning to September 2021. And when as it writes more for you, it gets dull and boring, leading to addiction to it because it lacks imagination, emotion, and artistic integrity. Since AI generated content lacks imagination or emotion, that means that millions of people if not more in the future may become addicted it as they command software to make it for them. The more AI generates, the less satisfying it gets and the more damage for it rises, leading to a vicious cycle of addiction that can be extremely difficult to get out of because it is both interesting and dull at the same time.<br/><br/>The only art not made by humans that could ever eventually be considered worthy of being protected by copyright is art that is also made with living individuals with lives, emotions, desires, and reasons to create. Up to now, every piece of creative media was created for a reason, a purpose with emotions driving its creation. Generative AI lacks emotion because it is not true AI. It is complex programming with no thoughts of its own. People have tried to use AI to generate art to sell online and labeled themselves AI artists. Under copyright law, derivatives of original work don&rsquo;t violate copyright as long as they follow rules such as not being commercial. If we are considering AI art to be derivatives, then it has definitely violated copyright more times than anyone is aware.<br/><br/>AI art in particular has many similarities to scraping tickets, trading cards, and more. The only datasets that wouldn&rsquo;t violate copyright would be ones that use public domain content, copyright free content, and/or content that has been given consent for to be used. But even so, they still wouldn&rsquo;t deserve copyright protection as creativity is not present in AI generated content. It&rsquo;s clear that only human made content deserves copyright protection. AI art hurts business and workers alike. AI generated content can and has been used to scam people. If art is stifled in favor of AI art, the public backlash would be enormous and as time would go on, what makes true art special could start to fizzle out entirely. Centuries ago, only the elite could afford to have artwork created. With the internet, art is now so much easier to commission than ever before. AI art disrupts this and is unnecessary and holds no true love or value. All of us can be creative. We don&rsquo;t need AI generated content to make pop culture and beyond evolve.<br/><br/>To copyright protect AI generated content is to stretch the definition of copyright in a direction that sacrifices it&rsquo;s integrity and function. So many people have had their art train AI without consent that scientists from the University of Chicago and others responded by working together to create Glaze, a software designed to prevent AI from successfully training on people&rsquo;s images without permission. And if AI were to train on images owned by companies such as Disney, that would create a lot of legal problems for companies with AI generating software.<br/><br/>Creative people drive our culture. Protecting AI content through copyright would break that apart. AI generated content must never be protected by copyright.",

Sure, it&#39;s available online - i can watch content streaming online, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can steal pieces of it and call it mine. AI chops up people&#39;s art and remixes it and that&#39;s not right. I wouldn&#39;t say that by posting something online I&#39;m consenting to have it stolen and used by someone else - especially someone that might turn around and try to copyright what it stole from me (because let&#39;s be real, we know that&#39;ll happen with AI). Plus AI is being used to replace artists and writers and more, and now we&#39;re supposed to train it for free? But even not considering that, if we&#39;re not signing something when we go online that says we agree that it&#39;s in the public domain forever, I don&#39;t think that AI should be allowed to just pick pieces of it for its own training.",

It is also polluting information sources as we speak and drowning out the creative efforts of the human beings it is stealing from. It is not an &quot;existential threat to the world&quot; the way its progenitors want you to think it is; however, it is smoke and mirrors from the same billionaires invested in destroying democracy (Peter Thiel and Elon Musk are involved with OpenAI, for example) and must be, at best, heavily regulated.

That has always been the standard and has been upheld in court cases stretching back years. Businesses may seek to change these rules, hoping to make a quick buck by gaining protection for work that requires no creative spark and no human effort. The point of copyright is to protect the rights of creators to their work, not to pay a content farm or a tech company money as a reward for avoiding human contributions. The Copyright Office must uphold the constitutional rights of creators, even when asked to void those rights by powerful and well-funded special interests looking to take humans out of the creative equation.",

I&rsquo;ve sold many screenplays to multiple Hollywood studios, and along with thousands of other scripts, my work has likely been used to train AI. I do NOT believe that AI generated scripts should be copyrighted. The source material it uses to produce something new is still that of a human writers, too plentiful to count, that receive no protection or knowledge of how this technology uses our work. I also don&rsquo;t agree that an AI generated script, then revised by a human writer should be copyrighted. If AI is involved in writing and/or acting it should not be protected material. AI is not human. AI does not create scripts without the help and source material of thousands of unprotected humans. Therefore it should not gain the copyright protections that human beings fought for. ",

As it is not artificial intelligence, it&#39;s effectively plagiarism software and it&#39;s already having an extremely destructive effect on all creative industries. At best the data sets should be purged, all generated material must be labeled as such up to and including watermarks for images and it should be illegal to scrape for data indiscriminately. <br/><br/>To quote Dr Timnit Gebru, the software is a stochastic parrot. It is not creating anything new, simply taking data and labor from humans and chewing it up. No consent was sought out for the data needed to power the software, by admittance of its creators, because it would involve asking too many people. <br/><br/>They have known from the start that this is not only a deeply unethical practice, it is theft.<br/><br/>Please consider data regulation.

Insofar as artificial intelligence does not meet this goal, it seems plain that it ought not to be eligible. While copyright doesn&#39;t have a bar for the quality of work, it does require that it be made by a human. Non-human animals are not eligible to hold copyright, so too should it hold that a non-animal intelligence would be ineligible.<br/><br/>Those who control and operate AI claim that their selection process and prompting process is itself an act of creation, but in fact it is not creating new works, but mixing up and &quot;sampling&quot; other works, often without the permission and consent of those artists or writers who are &quot;sampled.&quot;<br/><br/>Allowing AI to have standing with copyright protection runs the risk of diluting the protections that genuine artists ought to enjoy, as they find their work fodder for someone else&#39;s AI project, and possibly even risk the original style being mistaken for an infringement on the AI emulation.<br/><br/>Insofar as copyright exists to incentivize human effort and endeavor, to provide a limited protection in exchange for creation, AI does not deserve copyright, as it is neither human effort, nor is it creation.",

Adobe doesn&#39;t care about stopping ai from &quot;stealing artists work&quot;. nor does any massive corporation. to actually protect artists, either there needs to be a new system that protects independent creators and artists and gives them just as much (if not more) power over their own art as any corporation, or ai needs to be regulated in a way that the data being trained on is given up freely and knowingly by the creators. making stronger copyright will hurt all artists.

                "comment": "AI-created material poses a grave threat to human artistry and the entire landscape of creative work. Large language models threaten to create a storm of disinformation that floods our communication channels and ruins accessibility of accurate information online. Image production models are strip-mining art on the  internet and seriously threatening livelihoods for the artists. Video models are already enabling non-consensual pornography and deepfakes. In the best case, with the abuse cases reined in, large language models are feeding on centuries of artistic output, savaging the creators responsible, and sowing a landscape where human-created art is hard to find and the models have destroyed their own training sets going forward.<br/><br/>From a copyright perspective, there are two core reforms that must be implemented. One is a strict clarification that AI-generated content cannot be eligible for copyright protection - indeed, any work in which AI tools contributed in any substantial way to its production. If companies cannot hold copyright in their AI-created works, and therefore cannot control how those works are reused and redistributed, it will do an enormous amount to help preserve the careers of the creators being threatened. The copyright office has already made one ruling in this direction, but more is needed.<br/><br/>Second, a categorical ruling is required that inclusion of a work in an AI&#39;s training dataset is not a fair use. By a traditional four-factor analysis, every *individual* work in a training dataset is a relatively small component of the resulting output. But these works are being used in their entirety, were never intended to be used in this fashion, and LLMs are already creating a commercial catastrophe for the works they are trained on. We have already seen book publishers resorting to AI instead of cover artists, film studios claiming the right to use AI to replicate actors&#39; voices and appearances, and factual news being outcompeted by massive quantities of AI-written mostly-accurate dreck. Forbidding AI companies from including copyrighted works in their training data is a drastic step - but it is necessary to protect creators. AI companies will claim that this is tantamount to criminalizing their business models, but the truth is that those models are themselves criminal. And AI companies will still have a wealth of data available - public domain works, privately-purchased or generated datasets, and works with an affirmative license consenting to inclusion in a training dataset. But the presumption that any text or images on the internet are fair fodder for training LLMs is wrong, it is disrespectful, and it is destructive. Creators, commercially, must be present on the internet; saying that AI can hoover up their works is mandating that artists be complicit in their own destruction.<br/><br/>We have already seen, over the past months and years, that AI companies are fundamentally bad-faith actors here. They are producing harmful models, taking a wrecking ball to the creators they are ultimately dependent on. Much innovation is possible thanks to LLMs, but an industry that insists on self-regulation is one that intends to perform a slash-and-burn operation to the existing landscape of creative works. Artists and creators must be protected, or tomorrow&#39;s world will be one with a dearth of creativity and a wholesale demolition of the creator class.",

                "comment": "I am a working illustrator and recent college graduate. It has been surreal being in my last year of university and seeing the conversation around AI generated images. On a philosophical level, AI as we understand it today are only capable of &quot;creating&quot; anything in the sense that I stuck a frozen lasagna in the oven to &quot;create&quot; my dinner. AI cannot generate information by itself, it must be fed information first to be processed into something else. This will not change until we fully understand what &quot;consciousness&quot; is and are able to write it into code, which as a scientific breakthrough, is further away from us than aliens. <br/><br/>On a literal level, AI generated images rip the copyrighted works of various painters, illustrators, and visual creatives, and processes them into new images, without the permissions of the image creators or owners. Some of these new images are so close to the original that it would be considered grounds for copyright infringement if made by a human. This image generation has even tried to replicate the signatures of artists. Some have defended this point, stating that the AI is simply starting to understand that paintings are often signed by their creators, but remember that AI cannot &quot;understand&quot;. It is unconscious.<br/><br/>Since AI cannot create, cannot understand, and cannot even provide commentary, these images cannot be considered authored by anyone and should thus receive no copyright protection. Furthermore, AI has existed largely to process the copyrighted materials of visual artists, and generate imagery using the processed images. As such, AI imaging models using copyrighted materials in its data collection should be grounds for copyright infringement, and by extension, any generated works using the infringing data set. The alternative would be to allow a loophole in the copyright system that enables bad-faith actors to launder other peoples intellectual property for profit, which would fail the stated goals of the Copyright Office- To promote creativity and Free Expression.",

                "comment": "I appreciate the opportunity to comment on machine-generated content creation.<br/><br/>From what I understand, the term &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. I recently came across the description &quot;applied statistics&quot; and prefer this descriptor.<br/><br/>It seems that machine-generated content emulates what a human creator does (learn from copyrighted materials as part of the creative process) and is able to produce content much faster.<br/><br/>As an artist, I have used other artists&#39; work as part of my learning process (many art programs refer to this as a &quot;Master Study&quot; where students emulate a famous artist down to the brush stroke). When you examine my artistic influences, you will identify their work reflected in my own, even though I produce original pieces.<br/><br/>I believe machine learning from copyrighted materials is a valid approach for statistical generators.<br/><br/>In regards to whether AI creations can be copyrighted: Since US copyright only covers human-authored works, there should be a clear measure of human involvement. As an artist who has used AI tools for iteration and brainstorming (often incorporating my own artwork), there should be a clear delineation of how much input was provided by a human artist (in both text and iterations) and how much the work was edited afterward. (I&#39;ve used tools for initial creation, followed by my own refinements and additions to finish a piece.)<br/><br/>The creation process should be transparent, showing the stages of input, iteration, and final completion. Deciding the acceptable range of human direction and iteration is complex, but crucial.<br/><br/>Regarding the third matter, if AI-produced content closely resembles copyrighted work and doesn&#39;t qualify as fair use, the onus should be on the user who instructed the AI. For instance, I can use Adobe tools like Photoshop to reproduce copyrighted work, but the liability for its usage rests with me, not Adobe.<br/><br/>Addressing the fourth concern about artists fearing AI mimicking their style or identity: This is a challenging area, especially when considering the mutual influence among artists. Determining when a &quot;style&quot; can be copyrighted is tricky. However, if an artist&#39;s name is explicitly used during the AI&#39;s training process, they should be entitled to royalties for every generated image using their name as a prompt. Conversely, any creation derived from an image using an artist&#39;s name at any stage in its creation should be ineligible for copyright. Creators could consider using descriptors based on time periods or other thematic attributes to generate particular aesthetics. For instance, &quot;A superhero painting in the style of Van Gogh&quot; should not qualify for copyright protection while &quot;Painting of a superhero in the style of a post-impressionist using bold colors combined with thick, textured brush strokes&quot; could potentially.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my input!",

Any unique AI generation must be fully documented as such when submitted in any space, and a list of inputs must be required.<br/><br/>There already exist a plethora of circumstances in which people target specific artists and their aesthetics online for training their AI. Artists not just across the US but also across the world have been vocal about their complaints of their work being stolen and utilized in ways that should in no way be considered fair use.<br/><br/>Artists should own their art, voice actors should own their voice as a piece of themselves, and writers should own their works.<br/><br/>As a member of the USAF I already understand that my life as an artist is and will be filled with difficulties, there is no reason to once more take a real skill and degenerate it into a commodity that is STILL reliant on Painters, Digital Artists, and Photographers.

It does not seem unreasonable to assume that if unregulated this will soon be true of music, film, and visual art.<br/><br/>Mimicry is not art. Machine learning does not happen in a vacuum, it is taught on stolen and frequently copyrighted data. Creators have a right to opt out of their data being used to train machine learning models, especially when they might soon find themselves in competition with those models.<br/><br/>Copyright laws should absolutely be enforced against machine learning data going forward and retroactively.",

                "comment": "The use of AI based on or pulling from data involving the likeness of an actor or intellectual property of any artist should be considered unlawful and the most extreme violation of copyright law. Parties attempting to garner an agreement to use likenesses or intellectual property from artists or actors should come with stringent contract format requirements. Any contract for use of AI in these situations should clearly state the intention, as well as providing a tabulated list of exactly how those likenesses or IPs will be used. Anything outside of use documented by contracts should be considered an extreme violation of copyright law. The use of AI to create art without explicit permission from owners of the sources it pulls from is nothing more than advanced plagiarism, and needs to be treated as such. The narrative that AI is a cheat code for creating art easily needs to be struck down, as it will have a severe impact on industry and individuals. Not to mention the uses outside of art, which gone unchecked could result in a new age of misinformation, the likes of which have never been seen before.",

This AI technology is only able to create images and written text that might entertain others because it has absorbed millions of works by human creators, unfairly and without compensation. Even though what it produces might be an alteration from the original works it consumed, it is not the same as fair use because it is inherently derivative. The works used to train the AI should be at the very least licensed; the AI could be used to replace the original works and degrade all value from the original works by means of flooding the market with imitations. It should also be up to the original creators whether or not their works are used in a training dataset, with informed consent. This technology could limit or destroy the livelihoods for new and established artists alike. It is not adding new and original creations to society, it is simply stealing and regurgitating and replacing what humans have done. Please consider regulations and limitations on this technology. Thank you.",

                "comment": "I believe the big question in approaching copyright without entirely new legislation is where it stands as autonomous vs as a human driven tool. I definitely agree with prior decisions that AI generated content should not have copyright as it would betray the purpose of copyright (to encourage human artistic creation). I do however believe there should be some talk about the granularity in regards to the human input of copyright. It is possible for AI to reproduce copyrighted works, though typically with concerted effort on the part of the user. There should be some questions of liability there, requiring providers to take measures to limit it&#39;s ability to reproduce copyrighted works and user responsibility if they&#39;re shown to make an effort to coerce the AI into reproducing copyrighted works.<br/>There is also the question of whether or not the training dataset and the resulting training file qualifies as fair use. Obviously any copyrighted content in the training dataset would require license to copy the dataset, but it&#39;s the question of whether or not the training file is sufficiently transformative (it brings serious question in the instances in which it is able to reproduce a work, even if inaccurately)",

                "comment": "The development and use of AI in various creative spheres such as art and writing has shown that the developers of these projects are unconcerned with the ethics. Indeed, I think many users are similarly unconcerned. As a writer and a working creative person, I strongly urge the Library of Congress not to grant copyright status to works made through AI generation. These works are using the copyrighted material of who knows how many writers, artists and other creators to create digital golems. Someone commissioning an artist does not become an artist the moment they receive the purchased painting, even if the prompt was theirs. The only artist was the one who did the work. A person putting a prompt into an AI generator is not an artist or a writer, merely a commissioner. They hold no copyright, even if they decide to smudge up the art they ordered or edit some sentences. ",

All AI does is take the key words from real writing and use it to make a second-rate version of a writing sample. AI should never be used in regards to creative writing for several reasons but the main issue is that literature is human culture and AI will worsen that. Furthermore, AI will consistently make humans worse at writing, speaking, and will result in the devolution of the human species. It must be stopped now or else stories and culture will keep getting worse and so will basic language skills. The key words that AI uses belongs to the real, human writer. AI cannot rewrite anything better than it did the first time and since 99% of writing is rewriting, it cannot be classified as writing. Please, we must ensure that AI is halted forever in regards to creative writing.",

It would be illegal for a company to steal physical materials which they then use to create their product; it ought to be illegal for companies to scrape data without the consent of the person who creates or publishes the information, artwork, or other intellectual property. Content creators must be paid for their work, particularly if it is then being used by a for-profit company. Additionally, the use of AI to create deepfakes represents a danger to the public as deepfakes could easily spread disinformation or be used by fraudsters and identity thieves to defraud people and organizations. AI ought to be regulated to ensure that the originators of the data or images are fairly compensated, and to ensure protections for the public.",

Individuals are currently capitalizing on this confusion for their own self gain and detriment of others. To disincentivize this, works created by generative AI models should not be copyrightable in any way, and should go strictly to public domain where it can be as freely used as it has been freely generated.",

                "comment": "I&rsquo;ve been a professional television writer for over 15 years. I grew up poor in Pacoima, Ca. but I managed to create a life that&rsquo;s above middle class. But now my career seems to be in danger because of AI. Without regulation, AI seems poised to eliminate many jobs or suppress wages, including those in my field. The monopolization of Hollywood, due to vertical integration started with the elimination of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules and termination of the Paramount Decree. Every time these regulations are eliminated or weakened, those of us in the creative community suffer. As I write this, Hollywood writers and actors are on strike as a direct result. If AI is not strongly regulated, it would be just one more blow to the creative community. It will be used by studios and the corporate elites to further enrich themselves at the expense of their employees.",

Such license/rights negotiations fit right into current systems for actors, musicians, and others. If such standards are violated, the violators must compensate those they infringed on. Multiple offenses should levy harsher penalties, so as to discourage the wealthy from simply paying to commit crimes.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this new technology is dangerous as it is being used irresponsibly to create works that become attributed to people who did not write/say them, or to non-existent &quot;expert&quot; authors who give the public false information, all so that people who type a few sentences into an ai generator can make a few bucks off an e-book on Amazon. In the vein of current technological trends, it is trying to &quot;move fast and break things&quot; before it is regulated in such a way as to saturate our society to a point where it cannot be removed.<br/><br/>You should not be able to create ai-works using likeness without explicit labels or disclaimers declaring it as such. Allowing such things to exist in the public sphere threatens our democracy, with the public unsure if what media they consume is real or made by an ai.<br/><br/>When it comes to liability, I believe it should fall on the one who produces and displays works and not those who develop the system. Trying to train such systems to avoid similarities would be nearly impossible, and there is already a burden of responsibility on creators to not infringe on existing copyrights.",

I am concerned as a filmmaker, and also as the copyright holder of my own films and books. <br/><br/>I have been in the film business for 40 years, and as a filmmaker I am very disturbed at the current practice of GAI models ingesting 100 years of film and series in order to deliver spoonfuls of that copyrighted work on demand. This practice will not only destroy the structure of the film business by replacing large portions of our labor pipeline, but can only do so by using our own work against us. (This is part of the reason the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild are currently on strike against the studios and streamers.)<br/><br/>If this were a new tech that operated on its own, or ingested only the work of the user in order to deliver the results, we would not be sending you comments. But the GAI tech currently delivers ONLY if it has been fed our work. It is unable to produce results without stealing our work, much of it officially copyrighted. The absence of consent and compensation in this process is theft.<br/><br/>This GAI practice appears to many of us to be the largest copyright violation in the history of the United States. <br/><br/>I sincerely hope you can stop this practice of thievery so that our copyrights can continue to provide the innovation and investment for which the copyright office was established.<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention to this matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>Justine Bateman <br/>",

The idea that any artist -- writer, actor, painter, songwriter, singer, etc -- should have to fear loss of rights to their own material because it&#39;s being used to train AI is disgusting. AI cannot create -- it regurgitates -- and it&#39;s using our material to do so. Worse, it&#39;s doing it with the goal of taking jobs from human beings. To imagine a world where AI reads the great works of Shakespeare and then tries to write a new Shakespeare play... it&#39;s just despicable. Nothing made by AI should be open to copyright because it&#39;s never created... it&#39;s a mishmosh of someone else&#39;s (many someone else&#39;s ideas) -- it&#39;s NOT art.",

Copyright laws have already been abused by corporations to make it difficult for individuals to create both original and derivative works. Allowing companies or individuals to copyright AI-created content would stifle human creativity and destroy the work of artists. AI has learned on human-created content, especially the written word. <br/><br/>I am an author, and it&rsquo;s likely that my work and my creation has been used to train AI. Allowing content to be copyrighted that was created by a machine that &ldquo;learned&rdquo; from human creativity is, I believe, a grave threat to human creativity. What are we without our art, and content copied by a machine and spat out for consumption to make a company a quick buck is incredibly dangerous. I believe the copyright office has a responsibility to disincentivize the creation of AI content by companies who want to displace humans so that they don&rsquo;t have to pay them or support human art.

                "comment": "No content created by &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; should be copyrighted by a human, and legislation should be introduced and passed to prevent it. Given the current use of the technology, content created by these means is produced by stealing and replicating the work of creators who have not consented to this, and thus must not be profitable.<br/><br/>In addition, the use of this technology to falsify images and text portraying or purporting to be created by real people has the potential to do incredible damage. Most people lack the ability to immediately distinguish between a real photograph and one generated based on a prompt by AI. This could lead to increased credibility in dangerous misinformation, increasing its potency and affecting public perception and action around important global events. It&#39;s my opinion that this software should be heavily regulated or even outlawed due to its potential for abuse.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this seems to be the most recent example of a pattern: tech &quot;innovators&quot; develop an unethical means to generate profit, knowing that it will only last as long as it takes regulators to act against it. They develop these means specifically to work hard and fast, with no intention of creating positive change in the world (or even the market). In this case, these algorithmic platforms threaten the work of creatives in all fields, cutting labor costs for executives. So-called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is not meant to improve our society. It is meant to be the biggest, brightest flash in the pan of the 2020s, to hurt creative laborers, and inflate the bottom lines of those trying to take advantage of it.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking my comments.",

                "comment": "Artificial Intelligence is already committing blatant copyright infringement on a massive scale. That is the core of its nature, and the core of this issue. It is immoral in its annexation of human creativity, and amoral in its regurgitation of it. It does not differentiate between subversive art and propaganda, and perhaps that is why certain politicians and monied businesspeople are so enamores with it&mdash; it can give the illusion of inspiration to the most contemptible and crude ideas.<br/><br/>Proponents of this technology say it &ldquo;democratizes&rdquo; creativity, as if the relocation of creative output away from creators and into the hands of tech moguls is a selfless endeavor made on behalf of the common citizen. Well, I am a common citizen, and even I can tell that these efforts represent the wealthy class, unsatisfied with the complete exploitation of our bodies and minds for their financial gain, as they seek to extract all they can from our hearts &mdash; the very things that make us who we are as human beings, and the one thing that money can&rsquo;t buy.<br/><br/>I urge you to support the strictest legal guardrails for the use of this technology, to support robust legal protections for those most impacted and displaced by it, and to remember the lessons of the past few decades, in which infotech companies have grown into massive and dangerous political forces that shape the world around their bottom line &mdash; at great human cost. Think of the role Facebook played in inciting and encouraging the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar. Think of how young men are purposefully fed radicalizing content on YouTube, up to and beyond driving them to commit acts of violent terror. These companies will allow anything to happen to people as long as they can capture and resell the public&rsquo;s attention, and they will do the same with A.I. They already are.",

                "comment": "As we&#39;ve seen technology develop at faster and faster rates, it&#39;s become clear that the tech industry&#39;s approach is not to ask. &quot;should we develop this&quot;, rather &quot;let&#39;s develop this then force it into the market&quot;. There has been some success to that end, such as the rise of media streaming and smart phones, but we&#39;ve also seen it crash and burn, some times wiping out billions of dollars in the process (see cryptocurrency and NFTs). All of this is context to my opinion that AI very much falls into the same trap. Generally speaking, AI could very well be a great solution and tool for certain industries and jobs. But the rise of creative AI, in my opinion, does not fall into that category. Why? Because it is not actually addressing an issue that we face today as individuals, as society, or as a human race. Creativity is part of the human experience and has been for all of history. Song, dance, painting, storytelling - these are all hallmarks of our human history. We have never had an issue with creating our own entertainment and media. In fact, when given the resources, we&#39;ve seen time and time again that the portion of the population that embarks on creative endeavors rises, whether it&#39;s the mass distribution and access to cameras over time, or with computer programs that allow anyone to make music, or the rise of social media as a way for individuals to distribute their own art. In each of those examples, technology plays a role as a tool, but it is never the actual entity creating. So when I consider how we should approach AI, especially creative AI that can produce images, stories, or videos, I think we should be considerate of why it exists. It&#39;s not to make it easier for users who are already creating to create, it&#39;s for those who don&#39;t create at all to skip the effort of learning a craft, and instead just yield a product that could potentially make money. And while that isn&#39;t inherently bad, the fact of the matter is AI has to learn from somewhere, and it is currently doing so from creators who have taken the time to learn and master a given craft. So not only does creative AI not solve an actual problem, but it&#39;s sole purpose of being a money making machine relies on stealing intellectual property. Therefore, personally, I believe products yielded from Creative AI should not be applicable for copyright protection, and I&#39;d even go a step further to say that the companies making these AI&#39;s should be forced to license every single bit of creative material they are using to train their software. If the tech industry really believes Creative AIs are the future and critical to innovation, make them put their money where their mouth is. Otherwise we have to recognize it for what it is: a grift.",

                "comment": "As an artist, AI art has completely impacted my industry in a mostly negative way. With the endless AI art generators out there, people are able to use them to create &quot;art&quot; by inputting text prompts, including asking the AI to mimic a specific artist and pull directly from their works. This has resulted in people creating &quot;art&quot; that is NOT ORIGINAL in any way. The final piece uses previously created artworks by OTHER artists, which means that the person who created the final image using AI did not contribute any of their own actual artwork. <br/>AI has made it extremely simple for people who aren&#39;t even artists to rip off other hardworking individuals by using their own original artworks. I personally have already seen content creators online using AI generated art for their album covers, video footage, and even on packaging for products. There needs to be copyright laws in place to help the artists who create pieces that are being used and exploited by AI art generators. It is completely absurd and wrong for people to steal original artworks and ideas from other artists who actually put in the hard work for their pieces. Too many artists and creators are being negatively affected by this and it is causing a mess for our industry as a whole. Please put copyright laws into place for AI. ",

However, the allowance of AI to &ldquo;create&rdquo; art by way of being fed hundreds of photos that living breathing humans have made on their own with their own skills, technology, and craft, the AI is creating nothing new, and is instead phantasmagorically fusing images together without respect to craftsmanship, artistic integrity, or skill. It cannot make anything without first being fed, and those who are willing to bypass the natural process of learning and skill and application of artistic methods (be it paint, photography, digital art, pencil, etc.)  should be at the mercy of all copyrighted and intellectual property law available to the artists that they stole from. If you find my image and want to use it to create your image as a reference, I&rsquo;m ok with that. In fact, I welcome it, as I believe that copying is the best way to learn something. But scanning my art, feeding it to a machine, and typing in key words to spit out a Frankenstein-ed bastardization of my craft, and then decide to sell it or claim it as your own, I would expect that my country, that I paid to go to school for and through, would have my back and protect both my artwork and myself.

As someone in the business of finding reliable and high quality licensed imagery, I purchase licenses to stock libraries, which has now been overwhelmingly inundated with AI art. This imagery is therefore not only the aggregate of other copyrighted imagery, through stock sources like Adobe Stock it is being sold for profit. The images themselves are of lesser quality, and often have visual discrepencies that make them unusable. Something that is both in essence stealing copyrighted material and gaining a profit should be considered piracy, yet it is happening on mainstream services.",

                "comment": "I work as a freelance artist and believe I have some insight into this situation. I have spent hundreds, perhaps thousands of hours of my life honing my craft, and I&#39;ve seen the damage that these tools can do firsthand - with no regulation in place artists are having their art scraped from the internet and fed into machines that spit out a mimicry of everything put into their work. Prompts often go so far as to include the artist&#39;s name when copying a style!<br/><br/>This might sound enticing - cheap art done fast for no effort - but consider the long-term effects of this decision: these artificial intelligences are trained on the work of humans. If laws are passed protecting the use of AI commercially it will inevitably put real artists out of jobs, and if there&#39;s nobody left to train on but other AIs, the world of art will enter a period of complete stagnation, AI training on AI-created images. Regurgitations of regurgitations on and on forever.<br/><br/>This decision is a tipping point where you can decide to stave off a looming dystopia. A future where nothing is human-made and everything you see is decided upon by an algorithm. Where the art is appealing, but lifeless.<br/><br/>Do you want the things in your life to have meaning to them? Or is it enough that they&#39;re pretty?",

                "comment": "As a freelance artist of 11 years, I feel like I have a lot of knowledge on the subject matter regarding AI artwork. <br/><br/>AI is designed to imitate existing works created by other artists who&#39;ve honed their craft for years. AI doesn&#39;t create anything new or unique - it only copies from other people (most of the time where permission was never even given to them from said people to allow AI to use their artwork as a template to copy them in the first place). It is imperative that if AI becomes a norm in the industry, there must be a rule that states that the original artist is aware and okay with AI using their art as a template before AI makes any type of products from their work. Furthermore, the AI must credit the original artist that it templated off of, similar to that of someone writing a thesis who credits scholarly sources after quoting them, because if they chose to copy something from said scholarly source without crediting them, that&#39;s textbook plagiarism.",

To dismiss a persons devotion to developing their copyright protected work/vision/voice as only a &quot;style&quot; or &quot;technique&quot; so a computer can co-opt that voice or vision and use it for whatever reason is dangerous. I have already lost work to manipulated scans and copies of my artwork. It&#39;s hard to fight back in the marketplace when you are fighting against a computerized copy of your work offered to a client for less... that was looking for a piece in YOUR style!",

                "comment": "The Gen AI models released to the public are a major threat to justice, safety and breaks rules of fair competition ( antitrust laws ). Gen AI models we have seen rise in popularity over the last year have already done unimaginable harm to individuals and companies around the world. Billions of copyright holders have been robbed of their work, their names, likeness and opus plagiarized and devalued. Billions of users of AI have been made an accomplice in this crime as well. This was possible because of the lack of punishment for breaking data privacy and copyright online and the hidden nature of software development. If this is let to run wild it will ruin even more lives both of those it exploits by taking data from them and those it exploits by making them users of said AI.<br/><br/>Is Gen AI a natural development of tech? No, it is not. Machine learning is nothing new, what is new is where it gathered its data from. The value of these models IS the data it collected. The machine learning behind these models is a form of sophisticated reverse engineering and if its not accompanied by consent, compensation and credit its also data laundering. There has to be transparency to what kind of data these models are trained on from the very first foundational models available. <br/>Automatic optout is A MUST in these matters since an individual will not have enough time in the day to stop all the automatic scraping going on and attacking his digital doors so to speak. There can be hundreds of potential scrapes popping up daily, is one seriously gonna have to monitor by themselves all of this attempted unethical scraping. It will be impossible and it is impossible to opt out of everything all at once. Furthermore, how can a child opt-out of these models when uploading online, how can a business who doesn&#39;t have unlimited resources to spend on clicking boxes on a form? Same as one wouldn&#39;t want malware on their company PC automatic opt-out is a common sense conclusion and bare minimum of safety.<br/><br/>What should we do with AI models and products of AI - delete them. We should not tolerate harmful software and products that are at best spam content and at worst extremely harmful to society. Just like one deletes malware that&#39;s how we should treat this software.  We should not encourage the construction of models that can harm, we should not legitimize their use by saying we can build on top of them. We should not give copyright to things made on top of nontransparent and unethical software.<br/><br/>Please protect children, individuals, artists, non artists and all businesses by reaffirming copyright, reaffirming safety online, reaffirming theft is wrong offline and online.<br/><br/>",

If it cannot create, if it cannot actually think, then it cannot have the same rights as thinking, creative human beings. AI threatens artists&#39; livelihoods, making it easier for companies to save on labor but producing worse results. It isn&#39;t just that the results are worse, of course. It&#39;s that those results were scraped from the minds and pens of millions of people. AI cannot create anything new; therefore, it should not have the personhood needed to copyright.",

                "comment": "I am an entertainment and intellectual property attorney with over ten years of experience. I believe that generative AI presents significant questions. Specifically, I believe there are three issues: first, use of protectable works as inputs; second, protection of generative AI proceeds; third, protection of works arising from generative AI proceeds.<br/><br/>As to the first, I believe that the use of prior-existing, protected works in the programming of artificial intelligence machines and algorithms falls squarely within the plain text of the Copyright Act identifying uses related to teaching, training and research as fair uses. The plain text of the fair use provisions of the Act do not limit its application to teaching or training people (as the authorship requirement does relating to copyrightable subject matter), nor do I believe that Congress - when it enacted the statute - contemplated such uses. However, I do believe at the very least that research includes research into technological capabilities, and so it would not be unfair or unreasonable to treat &quot;scraping&quot; of Web sources as a fair use under the Act&#39;s current language. This is not to say that &quot;scraping&quot; activities which employ security and firewall countermeasures would be lawful under other federal laws related to computer hacking; but it is simply to say that as a function of copyright law, &quot;scraping&quot; constitutes a fair use to teach and train machine learners no less than using pictures or showing movies in a classroom constitutes a fair use to teach and train human learners.<br/><br/>Regarding the protectability of generative AI proceeds, I believe the District Court in the Thaler case came to the correct conclusion - that AI generation does not constitute &quot;authorship&quot; as it lacks a human hand in the fixation of the proceeds in a tangible medium. While the PROMPT that a human uses as an input may be subject to copyright protection independently, that is only because prompts constitute copyrightable subject matter. However, similar to how a motion picture is simply a derivative work of a literary work called a script or screenplay, to the extent an AI output can be said to be derivative of a human-authored input (the prompt), the motion picture and the AI output or proceeds are distinguishable. Just as a motion picture is a work independent of the script from which it derives, a motion picture nonetheless historically meets the test for copyrightable subject matter - it is human-authored; the &quot;creative spark&quot; interpreting the literary &quot;input&quot; of the script to the motion picture &quot;output&quot; is human. However, AI proceeds are not - in and of themselves - authored, thus any classification of them as &quot;derivative works&quot; of prompts authored by humans are too attenuated to render the AI algorithm a mere tool of creativity, as opposed to the primary source and fixer of the particular expression it puts out. For this reason, AI-generated proceeds should be considered public domain materials, no different than ideas, facts and events. In light of that, the Copyright Office should adopt a policy requiring AI-generated proceeds to be registered or kept by third-parties as AI-generated proceeds to prevent unnecessary litigation by those falsely claiming ownership over AI-generated proceeds.<br/><br/>Last, the question comes to how to treat works deriving from AI-generated proceeds. First, such works ought to be deemed protected to the extent they are protectable. While the AI-proceeds on which they are based ought to be treated as public domain materials, this is not to say that later translations and interpretations of them cannot obtain independent protection any less than books, movies and artworks based on factual events. However, I believe that the extent to which such protection exists ought to be considered by applying the merger doctrine/broad vs. narrow protection doctrine. The AI-prompter who wishes to use it as a starting point for a work ought to bear the danger that the more detailed the proceeds are which get generated, the more such person relegates to the public domain. As such, the more detailed the AI proceeds are, the more likely it is that a later work based on those proceeds will be subject to narrow protection, if not zero protection under the merger doctrine itself (if the proceeds are so sufficiently detailed).<br/><br/>I believe this would sufficiently fulfill the purposes of the Copyright Act, and would fulfill its role alongside the First Amendment to encourage robust participation in the Marketplace of Ideas, and strikes a reasonable balance between private interest and public benefit whereby the private individual or firm makes the decision for itself whether to abandon expressions within its possession to the public domain for the sake of efficiency or to avoid doing so for the sake of exclusive control.",

                "comment": "Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can only create content after being fed other content created by other creators. More often than not, in order to create a large enough data set for the desired product, this required AI programmers to feed the AI content that is created by other artists without their permission, which is a direct violation of copyright infringement for those whose art is supplied as part of a dataset for the AI. <br/><br/>Additionally, AI is not a living person to whom copyright protections could be applicable. Copyright is meant to help incentivize innovation, but AI cannot be incentivized, as it is not a living person. <br/><br/>The best comparison that an be made is to that of an orchestra. Composers are the true creators of the music. Their work is then given to musicians who perform what has been given to them under the direction of a conductor. The musicians and conductors are not the originators of the music they are performing, the musicians are merely performing based off of something they have been given, and the conductor is directing them to perform it. <br/><br/>An AI is merely creating something based off of another product it has been given, under the direction of its programmer. But the AI nor the programmer are the originators of the resulting product. <br/><br/>Artists, voice actors, musicians, and creators of all kind reserve to have their rights protected. Too often already, persons online are using ChatGPT and similar products to mimic the voices of public figures and voice actors, without their permission, thereby depriving voice actors of commission work. Artists are losing out on commission work because clients are feeding their works, without permission, into AI to create a product that they desire. It runs directly counter to innovation to have an AI produce all the work that a human otherwise should do. ",

                "comment": "AI is a non-sentient technological tool used to complete a task. A non-sentient tool cannot own the work product that it helps create. For example, a pencil cannot claim copyright ownership of the house plans the architect uses to draw them, nor can the pencil manufacturer. Neither a paintbrush nor its manufacturer can claim copyright ownership of a painting, even though both have contributed in some way to its completion.<br/><br/>Throughout history, great artists have used proteges and assistants to help them with tasks to complete their works. The artists direct the work of their proteges by defining the parameters of their task, and the expected output. Those assistants then work autonomously to complete the task. When the output fails to meet the requirements, the artist may then request further refinements and/or iterations. Even though these assistants are sentient, the supervising artist who directs the finished work retains copyright of it.<br/><br/>Generative AI is not sentient and does not create original content all by itself. It does so by request, based on parameters and expected output defined by the requesting entity&mdash;the user&mdash;who then asks for further iterations of refinement when the output fails to meet the requirements of the task. Therefore, Generative AI can be thought of as directly analogous to an assistant that helps an artist create art.<br/><br/>Often, employers stipulate as a condition of employment that employees forfeit any copyright claims for work products they create on on company time&mdash;regardless of whether the work product was requested or falls within defined parameters&mdash;and those work products, including intellectual property, belong to the company. Generative AI can also be viewed as analogous to a company employee creating a work product.<br/><br/>Similarly, composers hire session musicians to perform a piece of music. Sometimes the performers are directed to improvise original material within parameters defined by the composer, who may then ask for further refinements via iterations, or &quot;takes.&quot; These session musicians generally contractually agree on a flat fee for their services, forfeiting copyright claims or royalties from sales of the the final master recording.<br/><br/>It is possible that providers of AI services could stipulate that the work products created by their AI tools would belong to the AI service provider in an end-user license agreement (EULA) where the user agrees to forfeit any copyright claims over content generated by its AI. However, market forces would likely select against any service that imposes this kind of EULA because it would deprive the user of desired income from the content in favor of service providers that allow end users to retain copyright of the work.<br/><br/>Therefore, even if AI develops self-aware sentience, and absent superseding agreements where the user forfeits copyright claims to the AI service provider, the copyright for the work arguably belongs to the individual requesting the content, as opposed to the AI itself, the programmers who created the AI algorithms, or the service provider managing the AI portal.",

                "comment": "Works created wholly by or with the assistance of AI generation or other artificial intelligence tools should be labeled as such, or works should be mandated to disclose that they were created in this manner. Artistic works that are created with the use of artificial tools differ from traditional methods particularly in terms of effort, resources, and level of skill required, so when such artwork is marketed, it would be compared unfairly to other works. <br/>In terms of AI artwork, learning models that take aspects of existing art exist in nebulous area of copyright law and it is unfair to the artists whose art is the basis of AI generated works that others can freely use their creations through the &quot;loophole&quot; of AI collage. If art that is generated in this way, which reuses or plagiarises the work of other artists, the producer must be required to disclose this fact, or otherwise the AI generation models must be required to add a watermark or other indicator to all output that they are created with AI. Sound and musical recordings fall into this same category because they may include elements of copyrighted material or material that does not belong to the individual using an AI tool to generate the work, and so any works made in this way must include clear indication that AI tools were used, or the generator must include an indicator or audio cue that AI generation was used. This will inform record labels or other publishers that copyrighted material may not be properly attributed so they can make more informed decisions.<br/>In terms of scholarly writing and journalism, AI is a tool that will doubtless remove many hurdles of writers by providing a template or framework to write from. Because the facts or opinions provided by AI generation cannot be confirmed, verified, or wholly trusted, the audience reading these writings have an important, vested interest in knowing whether AI was used. In such cases the AI generator must be cited, or else the generator must be mandated to append a note, footnote, or other indicator that AI was utilized in writing the text. Because of concerns regarding the veracity of facts pulled from AI generation, this should provide a barrier to dissuade academics or journalists from using the technology. It is not professional to rely on a tool to automatically generate textual content when the job of an author or writer is to generate that content on their own. Until greater regulation or uniformity can be applied to available and forthcoming AI generation tools, their output should not be trusted or placed in front of an audience that expects to have accurate factual representation of events, figures, ideas, and so on. Failing to put in place any form of disclosure or protecion for the audience is a threat to academic and journalistic integrity to place trust in research or findings that are not verified by a trusted individual and instead generated by an algorithm.",

There is potential for such technology to radically alter the landscape of all digital content, while completely disregarding laws like intellectual property and especially harms individuals. The technology has gone rampant and needs limiting and lawmaking so as to secure artist jobs and a proper environment for expression. On top of being widely utilized, this early state of such technology gives the impression that content and media made with it will be effectively &quot;soulless&quot; and not show passion that is inherent and important to such content and media.",

If i copy and pasted sections from a newspaper into a new pattern of the exact same sentences and then sold it as an original newspaper, there would be no question that i had stolen information from articles someone else had written.

Our existing copyright system has already done more for corporations than independent artists, and ideas like extending copyright to cover art styles would give media companies like Disney or Viacom and tech companies like Adobe even more power over artist just trying to make a living. They don&#39;t actually care about protecting artists from AI. The only thing they want to protect is their bottom line.<br/><br/>In order to actually help independent artists, either a new system must be put in place, one which prioritizes independent artists and gives them at least as much power over their work as corporations, or AI needs to be specifically targeted by regulation - either by requiring that all data used was given freely and knowingly by the creators, or by classifying AI-generated works as derivative works of all works included in their data set, and requiring the disclosure of said data set.",

                "comment": "AI is a tool that&rsquo;s pointed on both ends. If abused, by billionaires who run movie and tv studios but root for those who make their movies and TV to go homeless instead of lay them a living wage, then human art will become obsolete. Worse, non-existent. We are creeping into the opening titles montage of a real life TERMINATOR movie, only instead of traveling back in time to fix our mistakes - we have to make the repairs in the present to save us from our own broken future. AI borrows and steals and cultivates art created by humans to pulp out a facsimile of said art, created by a machine made by the very people it copies from. That&rsquo;s not art, that&rsquo;s not creative. That&rsquo;s programming. To protect jobs in the service of art, especially in movies and tv, we need to protect ourselves from the temptations that the shortcuts of AI provides and put our energy and resources and money into the artist. Regulate the hell out of AI. The Terminator films aren&rsquo;t cautionary tales, but they will become just that if we don&rsquo;t guardrail the hell of the artificial intelligences eager to replace the real thing. ",

                "comment": "Generative AI should not be subject to copyright. The purpose of copyright is for an author to be able to continue to make a living off of their work. That is its only reason to exist. Generative AI is about corporations cutting authors out of the process and extracting money for themselves while supporting no one. One of the few ways they will be disincentivized to do this is if they cannot copyright the things the chatbots create. They want creations for free that they can then charge others for while maintaining ownership. That&#39;s all the pieces of the pie. Denied exclusive ownership, they are denied the &quot;value&quot; they hope to extract while refusing to give art and artists their due. <br/><br/>Copyright is not for corporate profits. Copyright is for artists and their families to support the continuation of the arts and should therefore be limited to creations by humans. ",

                "comment": "Especially as the way current &quot;AI&quot; works, I would say that any works produced by AI and other general learning model algorithms and processes should not be copyrightable. These machines take other people&#39;s work and regurgitate it in unpredictable but not wholly unique ways. The scraping of content in order to fuel these machines with enough data in order to produce somewhat useful function is key in that the authors of the works being used are often not consulted, paid, or attributed to the resulting works and AI/Learning machines effectively steal their content in order to function. There is no way to reliably detect or reverse engineer the results, so they cannot be trusted to disclose when they have or haven&#39;t used previously copy-written material without proper disclosure or compensation. Effectively, computers, like animals, cannot be granted copyright status over works, as they do not hold the capacity to understand their work or inspiration. The programmers (and companies) likewise cannot effectively attribute the results to their own datasets, so they should not own the results either. <br/><br/>Copyright protections are already too strong to the point where they are weaponized to hurt the public more than they are a benefit to society, it is time we start to work to not just prevent more of it in the future, but to reverse that effect.",

The United States of America stands at the front of protecting the rights and properties of individuals.   Is an AI an individual ?   This is easily answered because it is not.  People have creativity.   AI has regurgitated output from people input.  The old saying goes, garbage in garbage out.  If an AI is fed garbage it will regurgitate garbage.  If an AI is fed Brilliance than an AI reaches toward brilliance.  So did the brilliant warm-blooded individuals say - yeah sure the AI can have all my credit.  I think not.<br/>Thank you, Lonnie",

                "comment": "In no way should a work wholly created by any form of AI be eligible for copyright.  LLMs and their visual-creation counterparts operate by taking work created by a human, possibly copywritten in its own right, and iterating.  This is not the same as what a human might do using other work as inspiration.  AI can&#39;t, in its current form, be inspired.  It is using prediction models to guess what the next logical word or pixel should look like.  Nothing created is new and novel.  It is derivative and likely violating copyright laws.<br/><br/>At some point some government body is going to have to decide if a work that started with AI generation and then is worked on by a human is eligible.  To what extent is that provable and what would the percentage of unique human work required be?  I would argue anything that is based on AI generated work is already infringing illegally on copywritten material based on the way these AI models are currently trained (a wide net that indiscriminately catches anything regardless of origin) regardless of how much it is changed.<br/><br/>Impersonation of another whether it be by AI generated voice, written word, or visual art should be made illegal.  Creating a work in the style of someone else for profit without any effort beyond typing a few key words into AI will lead to the end of newly human generated art and, eventually, the end of culture.  While that may be someone&#39;s idea of progress it sounds very much like the death of the human soul.  We are all in a place now to put logical and reasonable limits on these corporations that are trampling over the humanities in the pursuit of &quot;progress&quot; and easy money.",

                "comment": "Regarding questions about the appearance of &quot;scraped&quot; works in AI-generated outputs and imitations of style presented in AI-generated proceeds, I believe there is a simple resolution: the firm or person who owns the AI machine or algorithm is not liable, but the person who uses such proceeds is liable for infringement.<br/><br/>Simply put, &quot;scraping&quot; is training. While the student at issue is a machine, it is no different than the art student who goes to the local art museum and sketches the works of Monet or Picasso in their notebooks. Nobody would ever suggest that their copying is anything other than a fair use, and nobody would ever suggest that the sketch they generate is anything other than a copy. However, the statute protects this conduct. But only up to a point. The moment that same art student publishes their sketch or sells it to a magazine, or publishes it to a website, that student&#39;s conduct ceases to be a fair use and becomes infringing copying and using.<br/><br/>In the same way, machine &quot;scraping&quot; (for inputs) and &quot;sketching&quot; (for outputs) is no less a fair use than the human art student. Similarly, if any person were to use what that machine generates, i.e. the AI-generated proceeds, and those proceeds incorporate infringing uses of another person&#39;s art, then the person who uses those proceeds is engaged in infringement. Thus, while it would not be infringing for an AI application to produce proceeds incorporating direct copies of another person&#39;s work, so long as there is no economic activity related to the generation (including selling advertising through the AI application or requiring a &quot;prompter&quot; to watch an advertisement before being able to view such proceeds), then the AI company remains in a strict fair use safe harbor. But the minute that AI firm steps outside the bounds of generating proceeds and into any realm that constitutes exploitation of such proceeds, it steps out of the safe harbor and becomes an infringer. Similarly, the &quot;prompter&quot; who copies and pastes those proceeds to their Instagram account, to Facebook, or makes prints and sells it, becomes an infringer. At which point, whether the &quot;prompter&#39;s&quot; conduct beyond creating an AI input prompt constitutes actionable conduct (i.e. more than a technical, de minimis infringement) ought to be a fact issue within the purview of the courts - not the Copyright Office.",

If the purpose of copyright is to stimulate creative works within the cultural landscape, AI does not do so. AI does not innovate, it may squish together ideas in interesting ways, but it does not innovate.<br/><br/>An AI image generator would never have created the impressionist movement, or the surrealist movement or abstract expressionism. It takes a human mind with all of its messy madness to break out of bonds and create a new idea.<br/><br/>AI text generator would never have created the cut-up movement or the post-modern novel or even the general structure of pulp that guides vast amounts of literature today.<br/><br/>An AI music generator would never have created jazz on its own. It might be able to generate new jazz forms but nothing will break out into whatever the next world changing creative paradigm is.<br/><br/>If you hand the reins over to AI and incentive its generation of infinite amounts of pink goo, you dilute the few beautiful and talented voices that are creating our next momvements in art, music and literature.<br/><br/>AI is a toy that borrows human creativity and re-hashes it into something else. It can only move all art and literature towards a boring center if allowed to proliferate wildly. Acknowledging AI generated content as creative work will stop all innovation in art in its tracks.",

                "comment": "I cannot claim to be an expert. However, I have been fairly involved in discussions surrounding this topic and have tried to keep myself informed. As such, I have identified a few key points that I believe absolutely must be taken into account regarding any regulation.<br/><br/>1. There is a great deal of misinformation floating about regarding AI/Machine Learning. For example, there is a persistant belief that these technologies make a &quot;collage&quot; of stolen works. This is not the case, and the technologies involved do not store or even have access to the training materials in their model once training has been completed. I hope those involved in making these decisions will take their information from experts in the field who know and understand how the technology works while discarding misinformation.<br/><br/>2. Future-proofing. There was recently news about a ruling that copyright requires &quot;human&quot; input. While, presently, Machine Learning contains no true intelligence, I believe the wording of any regulation should find other ways to qualify or disqualify a work. There is the possibility in the future that true AI, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could be created, and the potential for creative works produced by a non-human sapient being should absolutely be a accounted for. I would argue that a work created entirely by algorithm does not qualify, of course, but even otherwise untouched works still involved the detailed crafting of a prompt. Does a prompt - written by a human - run through an incredibly complex algorithm to produce an image or text qualify? That is a question which should take into account existing tools that do similar things currently in-use in many digital arts. Algorithms to make work easier are already common in the field.<br/><br/>3. Impact to artists. This would be one of the few counter-arguments that I would have to agree has some merit. Unfortunately, I would suggest: where would we be today if people regulated the invention of the industrial loom into the ground and prevented the Industrial Revolution because tailors who produced clothing by hand would be put out of business? It must be carefully weighed whether the benefits to society and the economy and the human race are greater if we stifle or encourage this fledgeling technology. In my personal calculus, we must absolutely encourage it. But I am not an expert, and experts should have their words outweigh mine.<br/><br/>Another common argument is that of &quot;ethics,&quot; and the common arguments are ones I vehemently oppose. A Machine Learning model learns patterns and how things are typically connected by studying existing art. It does not then keep the existing art. It is not available in any database or in any form to the model. It only keeps what it learned from the art. In this way, it is no different than a human art student using reference images or learning art by studying the art of other artists. There is nothing unethical about it. There is no theft involved. Any argument to the contrary would also call every human artist that ever learned from another artist or used a reference image to be in breach of copyright. I would urge those involved in these decisions to, again, listen to the experts on this technology and disregard the emotionally-charged arguments based on misinformation that commonly accompany any arguments about the &quot;ethics&quot; of this technology.<br/><br/>Machine Learning is in its infancy still. It has a long way to go. But it is my sincere and honest belief that this technology, if allowed to grow without undue restrictions placed by misguided fearmongering, will be one of the most revolutionary and beneficial technologies that humanity has ever produced. Already, the same underlying technology is being used to give speech back to stroke victims. It&#39;s being used to analyze data faster and more efficiently than ever before, leading to things like improved medications for the sick. And while those uses of this same technology are outside the purview of Copyright, unduly stifling the technology where copyright applies will also stifle the advancement and development of all forms of this new technology.<br/><br/>So my final hope is that those involved with this decision will look at how their decision will affect this technology and the people touched by it even outside of copyright itself, as these decisions being made will undoubtedly ripple far beyond copyright law.<br/><br/>In summation, I am not advocating for a total lack of regulation and consideration, but merely a light touch tempered by facts and a consideration of the larger issues at stake, rather than misinformation or fear-mongering or short-term gains.",

The process of creating something from AI is to utilize the hard work of actual humans that most often do not consent to the usage of works in the AI work. Even if there is consent the final product is still in the end created by a machine. The person who generated it by AI did not put in any of the work to do so. By not being the direct author of the work this would open up the copyrights of many fields and lead to many issues. Especially when AI work pulls from people whose work is copyrighted already without consent which happens often. AI if used should only be used for personal purposes, and as a result should not require a copyright. If used commercially then it&rsquo;s setting a precedent that the people whose work contributed to the generative AI do not deserve to be paid while the person with AI got paid. It is wrong and will lead to many Americans who creatively produce out of passion for their communities to lose their livelihoods by allowing it. ",

                "comment": "In the rapid realm of technological advances AI and generative AI are perhaps growing the fastest. In order to keep up with their growth I believe it is important for policymakers and others in charge of various things to keep up to date alongside such advances. However currently as it stands I think we&#39;re treading a fine line. I do not think AI created works should be copyrightable at this point in time. While some AI generated &quot;creations&quot; can be interesting their entire workflow relies on using creations created and copyrighted by real people. With so much copyrighted content being thrown into what&#39;s essentially a blender and spitting out a smoothie it seems irrational and unjust to potentially say that the individual drinking the smoothie would be the one who gets to decide they can sue others for making the same smoothie so to speak. While they may have chose the ingredients. all those ingredients were created by the work of many and often in the current AI wild west era are taken without permission. I personally believe if any copyright scenario is to be involved in generative AI works then it should be spread equally/weighed via contribution% among all the creators whose work was used to create the output (Every artist who&#39;s work was thrown into the blender, everyone involved in the creation of the AI, the individual writing the prompt assuming the AI isn&#39;t trained on stolen content.)",

Also with no sources cited you cannot really be sure where it&#39;s getting it&#39;s information, so you really cannot use things like Chat GPT in your work.<br/><br/>I am also a writer. AI is good for things like brainstorming but I would not use it beyond that because you didn&#39;t know where the information is coming from.<br/><br/>I tried Sudowrite and had issues. 10 to 100 dollars for limited words, that you can use up in less than 24 hours if you have no clue about how it works. You also don&#39;t know if it&#39;s coping a published author when you ask it to type something. Same with any of the AI software out there.<br/><br/>Also people are using AI to write books and publishing them, though it&#39;s hard to prove that AI was used.<br/>",

AI has no place replacing the human desire to make art. I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of uses where AI could be helpful, but stealing jobs is not one of them. It should make our jobs easier, not unemploy us all. ",

                "comment": "As a television writer and member of the Writers Guild of America, I am very alarmed and concerned about a future where A.I. generated works can be copyrighted. A.I. algorithms scrape data from existing copyright material that was created by humans, with human effort, and synthesize it into something new. In other words, they plagiarize human-written material. Therefore, works generated by A.I. should not be copyrightable. This must be codified by law, in perpetuity. And the writers of works used as input data for machine learning should receive royalties for helping train these systems. After all, downloading a book or movie and reproducing such works without proper permission and payment is a copyright offense. The A.I. companies will argue that what their algorithms do is no different than what a human writer might do -- consuming media and then incidentally or intentionally using it as inspiration for a new piece of material. But humans can only consume a fraction of what a machine can, and they cannot analyze it and reproduce it with exact precision. While a piece of media may form an impression on a writer and affect their own work going forward, they are not simply regurgitating or imitating that same work the way an A.I. algorithm would. These creative algorithms also allow companies that use them to undercut worker compensation or eliminate jobs that were once steady and lucrative. A.I. is simply being used by companies and individuals to cheat and plagiarize, and do little else. Technology should be used to solve problems in our world, not create more. Unfortunately the free market cannot stop this kind of harmful &quot;innovation.&quot; It is up to the government to put in guardrails that regulate against a future with people out of work while robots copy and paste those same people&#39;s past labor into perpetual profit gain for tech and media companies.",

The work of a possibly uncountable number of writers and artists has already been exploited by AI companies without compensation. AI is also negatively affecting quality of life in three ways. One, by replacing humans in art and writing positions. Two, by sucking up resources that could go to human invention, and instead producing a slurry based on existing work of images and writing and stifling innovation. And finally by producing cut and paste articles and responses that are not necessarily accurate, could be misleading and could also be easily used to misinform. ",

This is not artistic influence, it is plagiarism and should be treated as such. No copyright should be granted to work created in this way. I am a published author, and the idea that by virtue of publishing my work, I have granted permission for it to be used in this way goes against everything we believe about copyright and fair use in this country. There is nothing fair about taking the work of human hands and minds, ventriloquizing it, and then claiming that it is original work. The chilling effect on creative work by this technology is incalculable. Why should anyone make or share anything if they know it will only be fed into the maw of this machine? If Mickey Mouse can be protected for a century, I should be able to expect that my work, my livelihood, will be protected for ten minutes from being strip mined in this way.",

If someone could have an AI taught on their work alone, or exclusively with their express permission, I think it would be fascinating, but as it is, it&rsquo;s horrifying and seems to be only getting worse. I heard conversationally that some are considering blocking AI from being copyrightable, and I genuinely think that is a choice for the better. As things are at the moment, &lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; programs are unethical at best.",

AI generative tools are also extremely basic and unoriginal, and the hype around them is all to generate kite money for big corporations.

They have rather accurate.y been described as &ldquo;plagiarism engines.&rdquo; Those works that they draw from are generally original and capable of being copyrighted. <br/><br/>The idea that someone could simply collect some sample of such fragments and &mdash; without any creative input &mdash; copyright the output seems fundamentally inconsistent with nature of copyright. <br/><br/>Further, it is contrary to the purpose of copyright, which has been to permit human beings to protect and benefit from the production and dissemination of their creative works. Here there is no human author, and so no need to copyright the output material and protect the rights and interests of the author, because there is in fact no actual author involved.<br/><br/>Worse still, we have already seen that AI-produced material is used to simulate the work of real, living, human authors, and that this AI product is then marketed as being by those human beings. This further deprives real authors of the benefit of their own work, and damages and devalues their reputations, since some people will assume that substandard even even grossly inaccurate (and even dangerous) works are the result of a human being. This damages real authors by redirecting value from creative authors, as well as putting their reputations and public standing at risk. That seems grossly opposed to the most basic justifications for copyright.<br/><br/>Copyright should not be extended to AI-produced material.",

Works placed on a platform like Twitter/X, art sites, or hosting services shouldn&#39;t be free rein for AI to simply absorb and use artists&#39; work without compensation. And most of all, using AI to absorb the speech of given people shouldn&#39;t be used to simply create wholesale speech of that person, as that can become very dangerous when not even someone&#39;s spoken words are safe from being faked.",

They are not only stealing original work to train their AI, which will supposedly be worth billions of dollars, but they want to use these &#39;generative AI&#39; programs to minimize labor costs and destroy the ability of these same artists to earn a living. <br/><br/>This is happening right now, and the government has done nothing to protect its citizens from these massive corporations and highly funded startups. Movies, music, and television are some of America&#39;s most valuable exports, economically and culturally. It has helped us assert our dominance. If the government of the United States does nothing to protect artists and exclusively listens to CEOs of tech companies and studios, you will be allowing them to decimate these industries, and over time they will lose the global dominance they once had.",

Both my writing and my pornography has been used to train AI; I know this because my name is listed in public data repositories. Obviously, this is horrifying. I think the use of my writing is of course unacceptable, but appropriation of images of my body is particularly disgusting. My art is very personal and to have images of my body used without my consent, often in the creation of violent and dehumanizing imagery, is completely unacceptable. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time :)",

                "comment": "Regarding the question on accountability and record keeping, I believe the Thaler Court was correct - AI-generated proceeds are not copyrightable, whether the process by which they are generated is ultimately deemed a fair use or not. First, AI-generated proceeds ought to be treated no different than facts, events, and works long since fallen into the public domain such as Romeo and Juliet or The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. They are public domain materials which anybody can take advantage of, and the AI &quot;prompter&quot; understands the caveat that whatever the machine spits out does not belong to them. Second, though, to the extent AI-generated proceeds incorporate elements made up or deriving from works by others that are protectable, those elements remain protected but owned exclusively only by the users. The use of protected works in creating a prompt, or the appearance or presentation of protected works in AI-generated proceeds does not automatically abandon those works or the elements of those works appearing in the proceeds to the public domain; anymore than suggesting that the original expressive elements Disney&#39;s interpretation of Huckleberry Finn are any less protectable than the Nee Brothers&#39; later interpretation of the same character in &quot;Band of Robbers.&quot; Original works used cannot be &quot;washed&quot; of their protected status simply because they end up incorporated in AI-generated proceeds. The monopoly of exclusive rights, however, remains exclusively within the control of the author or owner of those works.<br/><br/>However, the obvious problem arises in the context of litigation. Woe be the alleged infringer who pleads the plaintiff lacks valid ownership of the work in question because the work is based on a public domain work, to wit, AI-generated proceeds. How does this infringer obtain evidence that the &quot;work&quot; at issue derives not from the plaintiff&#39;s original expression, but from AI proceeds generated from the plaintiff&#39;s mere original prompt? The alleged infringer does, after all, have the right to use those proceeds as they belong to the public domain (the Thaler Court got that correct that AI-generated proceeds are not copyrightable for lack of authorship). But how does this infringer obtain evidence contradicting the plaintiff&#39;s assured testimony that &quot;of course I didn&#39;t use AI! I came up with it all by myself?&quot; To that end, there must exist a repository of AI-generated proceeds; an affirmative record of the public domain, so to speak, to provide the alleged infringer evidence to disprove that which the plaintiff may prove merely by stating a negative: &quot;no, I did not use AI.&quot; This could include a requirement to third-party AI firms to maintain at all times a complete and total record of the proceeds generated by their software and machines (yes, even user-prompted generations). This could include a federal registration of AI proceeds. This could include a requirement that all AI firms include a digital watermark in all of their machine proceeds, that works with an indemnity provision protecting the innocent &quot;alleged infringer&quot; by allowing them damages from the third-party AI firm that failed to maintain its records. But there must be a means of proving that AI proceeds were generated in the first place, as it would make no sense to place on the plaintiff the obligation to prove a negative and which could be arrived at merely by such plaintiff&#39;s denial. Or, at the very least, to indemnify the innocent copyright defendant against damage arising from a third-party&#39;s failure to maintain that record such as to give the defendant a fair opportunity to defend themselves.",

Anything else undermines tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of artists, authors, and others (both professional and amateur) to produce something worse than the sum of its parts. This would be a step to crush artistry as a means of livelihood, which will in turn degrade industries that produce mediocre content at the expense of both employees and consumers. It benefits nobody in the long run under any implementation, and will contribute to a vast dilution of culture to its blandest roots. <br/><br/>While not as acknowledged as military power, American cultural power remains one of its strongest assets on the international stage. Allowing GAI to subsume the creative sphere will wholly undermine this competitive advantage. ",

Evidence of the former is substantiated by the filing of multiple copyright lawsuits currently in the court system. A defense that the generative AI is only inputting word sequences is not justified when the AI is able to generate output strongly correlated to the text of copyrighted material. If only word sequences were being recorded then the AI would not be able to output a detailed analysis of any given author&#39;s work; this would only be possible if the work in question had been in the ingested data.<br/><br/>One question to be considered is what are the author&#39;s rights when copyrighted materials are publicly available. Are the rights to analyze the the materials enhanced when the writings are published electronically but still protected by copyright? Does making the text more easily accessible modify the author&#39;s rights in any way?<br/><br/>As an IT professional, an author of peer-reviewed journal articles, and a contributor to various open-source projects and documentation efforts, I am concerned about how public, semi-public, and paywalled/private information is being ingested into the various generative AI engines. Ingestion of pure public, non-copyrighted text (if there is such a thing) should be openly allowed. Pulling in copyrighted materials without the authors consent is not acceptable even with the justifications that only word sequences are being analyzed.",

                "comment": "We need a new legal framework that is separate from copyright.<br/><br/>An LLM is constructed as a distillation of an enormous body of input - text, code, sound, video, etc.  Any of those specific items can be copyrighted.  Any of those items may have rightsholders who do not consent to having their content included in the training of the LLM.<br/><br/>After the distillation, people can use the LLM to create new works to solve their problems - and those works may bear a lot or very little resemblance to their sources - but all that the LLM can do is in some fashion restate what it has already absorbed (probabilistically, and with a lot of technical details and asterisks, but in essence that is the truth).<br/><br/>Consequently, one of the following is true, and we need new law to decide:<br/><br/>1. The social good of the LLM-as-concept is so great that the rights of the copyright holders are outweighed (possibly a fair use expansion) and thus they have no recourse.<br/>2. Any LLM will have to prove that all material used in its training was either not copyrighted, or permission was obtained (good luck proving that).<br/><br/>These are mutually exclusive propositions.<br/><br/>So if we go down the road of 1, we permit the general destruction of copyright as a concept, because derivative works will be just as good and there won&#39;t be any reason for people to pay rightsholders anymore.  But we get LLMs.<br/><br/>If we go down the road of 2, every LLM that exists today has to be deleted, and new ones will have a tough road to proving their content is acceptable.<br/><br/>I suggest we go down road 2, because theft is unacceptable, even if social good results.<br/><br/>As a practicing software engineer I make use of LLMs and receive benefit from them, but ultimately I think the technology is a land grab that is immoral and should be illegal.<br/>",

I didn&#39;t consent to that. No one asked me to use them, I wasn&#39;t being compensated in any way and no one even notified me that they were being used. I just HAPPENED to find them. I wasn&#39;t happy. Even now that I&#39;ve managed to opt those pieces out, I&#39;m still not happy. I feel somewhat like I was stolen from. And I&#39;m not the only artist dealing with this. Far more talented and well-known artists than I am are dealing with this and it&#39;s affecting their job opportunities - google is being flooded with art that isn&#39;t theirs but winds up tied to them with keywords because the generators mimicked their style and these generated images are drowning out their actual work. AI generated images are showing up at booths at conventions, affecting gig workers and small time artists. Artists who rely on conventions and commissions to pay their bills.<br/><br/>Artists have spent years building a skill, their craft, it&#39;s such an inherently human trait to create. To want to invoke an emotion or put your own out somewhere into the world. AI...isn&#39;t doing that. It&#39;s slapping something out in a few minutes ripped from other people&#39;s work. There&#39;s no innovation or inspiration behind it. There&#39;s no feeling or thought. And it has a direct negative impact on people. I feel like AI has its place in some things, but art and writing are definitely not it.",

This also violates copyright since it is not fair use and often not a satire/parody. In many instances AI can be requested to reproduce a copyrighted work with minor/no changes. Although people talk about AIs being &quot;trained&quot;, it is a misnomer. Essentially, the database is a reference library that the AI uses to generate responses. Several experiments have shown that responses can be altered by including or excluding certain material. <br/>B) As a secondary matter, AI work should not be copyrightable. Often the work is a melange of other copyrighted works in its &quot;training&quot; database. The requestor is not a creator any more than someone typing in keywords into Google for a search is a &quot;creator&quot; of the list or any works within the list. In a similar way, DNA is generally not copyrightable except under certain circumstances. Furthermore, it is considered unethical and possibly illegal to copyright a genetic code stolen from someone else. Currently AIs do not create work. If the database does not have prior samples of something, the AI is unable to produce a satisfactory work. For example, if one requests &quot;draw an organically derived spaceship&quot; but eliminates all references to &quot;spaceships&quot; in the database, the AI will be unable to produce a satisfactory drawing because it does not have something to copy/frame. <br/>C) Because AI is dependent on its database, as already evident in several public examples, the AI can/will be as biased as its database. For example, recently an Asian woman requested that her photo be touched up to be more &quot;professional&quot;. However, the AI altered her photo to be a blond, blue-eyed woman. ",

On this fact alone, AI should be restricted and forced to obtain consent for their training models. <br/><br/>AI&#39;s potential for &quot;disruption&quot; is also an existential threat to many creators and workers, eliminating their jobs or forcing workers into even more dismal conditions as they are phased out. If we had some safety net for the unemployed, or any safety net at all, that would be one thing. But as long as AI is owned by corporations and there are no safety nets, then AI should be heavily regulated. <br/><br/>AI also has a deleterious effect on our country&#39;s discourse and is incredibly dangerous. AI is a powerful tool to create misinformation, misrepresent people, and fill the internet with even more drivel. The fact there are AI written foraging and mushroom books being sold now (with no oversight as to their content, putting people at risk) is proof that AI cannot be allowed such free reign. What if an AI model was used to create hoaxes in the political field? Or to spread misinformation about vaccines?",

                "comment": "It&#39;s important to begin, and swiftly, to erect regulations regarding the training, use, and naming of so-called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;. <br/><br/>NAMING: &quot;AI&quot; as it currently stands is a marketing term, and is grossly misleading as to the capabilities of these data-aggregating software systems. There is no intelligence behind them, and to continue to use this term risks confusing and potentially defrauding the consumers who use the product, by leading them to believe that the information they&#39;re receiving has thought or intelligence behind its creation. This is untrue: these are statistical models that use probability to determine a likely sequence of words, pixels, or other data points that might fulfill a user&#39;s request.<br/><br/>TRAINING: &quot;AI&quot; as it stands is trained on millions of copyrighted works, in overwhelming part without the consent or permission of the creators and copyright holders of those works. If an individual did this it would be decried as &quot;piracy&quot;; but since corporations are doing it and individual human beings are the victims, it is proclaimed to be &quot;the progress of technology&quot;. We need immediate regulation of &quot;AI&quot; training data sets, including regulations specifically requiring the disclosure of exactly what works a given &quot;AI&quot; model was trained on and regulations requiring corporations and individuals that train &quot;AI&quot; models to obtain the permission of copyright holders before using copyrighted works in their training sets.<br/><br/>USE: The owners of the &quot;AI&quot; models should be required by law to disclose, prominently and in no uncertain terms, that their tools are not intelligent in any way, that they are mere statistical models, and that the results they provide may not be accurate in any sense of the term, merely the next statistically likely set of data points arising from the prompt. In addition, the users of &quot;AI&quot; should be required by law to disclose, prominently and in no uncertain terms, that any work they publish that substantially arises from the use of these tools was generated by a statistical model and not by a human creator. The latter is especially necessary if the owners of the &quot;AI&quot; tools are not barred from using copyrighted materials without permission to generate their training sets.<br/><br/>Finally, regulations should be set in place establishing that, as with works created by animals and other forces of nature, any text, image, or other work generated by an artificial intelligence cannot be copyrighted.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.",

                "comment": "Artificial intelligence is not a unilaterally evil or dangerous thing in its current state. As is, i believe fears of AI-takeovers are still well within the realm of fiction. However, it has been made quite clear how many businesses-specifically large corporate entities, seek to utilize it. in the last few months, we have seen many creative-based jobs get pushed aside in hopes that AI programs such as ChatGPT (for written works) or Stable Diffusion (for artistry). And what is worse is that the exploitation of these processes go both ways. On the other side, the neural networks create their works based on the collection of human-made data off the internet, often without direct permission or awareness, and then attempt to reconfigure it into something that matches the prompts they are given. The outcome is something that is derivative at best, and uncanny at worst.<br/><br/>To wit, it is in my humble opinion that I would request that any venture or business that utilizes AI in place of human involvement be met with significant scrutiny. AI is not a replacement for human knowledge, or effort. It can be support and supplement, but it cannot and should not replace any one person or position that they might hold.",

In my personal experience I have seen people use generative AI to claim to be artists and profit as such while putting in as little labor as possible in the creation of the piece of media that they claimed to have created. Instead of putting in the time and effort to learn and develop the skill and acuity to create art, they steal media from another artists and run it through a program or programs that have databases built on even more stolen media to generate a slightly different media at the command of a handful of prompts. They have left the labor of creating the media solely to machines and machine learning and removed the human factor, the factor that defines any piece of media as art, from the media that have &quot;created.&quot; Such is why I am in support of regulating generative artificial intelligence. It will protect the jobs of hardworking individuals, and protect them from malicious actions, whether saidbactiosn are from other individuals or corporations.",

                "comment": "I think AI poses an existential threat to art, to creativity and even to normal administrative jobs in America as mentioned by one of its creators Geoffrey Hinton. Corporations have already become mammoth profit machines that have caused huge income inequality. They almost need to be saved from themselves. If they are allowed to adopt AI as a standard, I think it will lead to the downfall of this nation, killing jobs and making people unable to afford the very products and services they sell. The creative community, of which I am a part as a successful Hollywood writer and actor, has been embroiled in a a four month long fight with the corporate studios who refuse to recognize this danger and has already caused significant pain and distress to one of the few industries where America still truly has the number one place in the world. AI has the potential to ruin human creativity, replace millions of jobs that people have worked and trained for, plus if allowed to run unchecked, can surpass human ability to control it. Again, as mentioned by Mr. Hinton who had a huge part in creating it. Please continue to protect human lives and livelihoods as other fellow human beings.",

However, I still enjoy creating art and sharing it with my friends and family via social media and the internet. My intention when I create and share art is not to &quot;feed&quot; any artificial intelligence roaming the internet in search of material to steal from its rightful owner in the name of &quot;training&quot;. If the companies behind such artificial intellegence systems wish to obtain data on which to train their product, they should purchase it just like every other customer of artistic and creative endeavors. Those individuals who do make a living out of their creative endeavors deserve just compensation for the labor and education that have gone into such creations. A future where AI is allowed to steal freely from any human who uses the internet is a bleak one. Please help us protect the human spark of creativity and passion that brings joy to us all. ",

Sure, if it can be implemented properly by people who understand it, it would be nice but I disagree 100%. It&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to see AI be something that can replace people.",

                "comment": "Artificial Intelligence and its use is, at its core, detrimental to every and all creative endeavors. To take art away from human hands and have a machine falsely replicate it with no emotion, no passion, and no skill: it is not art at all. AI in creative spaces does nothing but raise questions about copyright ethics while also putting entire industries of creative individuals out of their jobs. <br/><br/>AI creates a financial strain on both creators and lawmakers. Creators must fight for their copyright when their artwork or writing is used to feed AI and courts, already backlogged, will be overrun with copyright claims to a point that creative people, spaces, and content will slowly but surely disappear. Without humans creating the art being stolen for AI training, there will be nothing for AI to be trained with.<br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence is not an infinite resource and it is not self-sustaining. It is misnamed in a way that ignores its human operators, who are stealing everything from copyrighted work to private documents to your social media posts. It is misnamed in a way that suggests the machine it runs through is sentient or capable of sentience. In reality, it is not intelligence of any kind. It is coded software to detect patterns and to mimic patterns. <br/><br/>As an artist in book publishing, it&rsquo;s a terrifying reality to have to include clauses in my contract that prohibits the use of my work in AI, whether that be AI training, use of AI to make work similar to mine, or use of AI to finish my uncompleted work. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to fight for my copyright at every turn. <br/><br/>AI as it exists now in art is not a step forward into an easier future. It is not a bright nor progressive future if machines are putting hard working artists, authors, designers, etc. out of jobs that are crucial to community, connection, and equitable societies.<br/>",

                "comment": "AI as it exists now is not artificial intelligence. Its only capability is to analyze pre-existing work (typically created by humans, but it could theoretically analyze work created by other AI networks if that is put into its dataset) and then to shuffle that around to try to create something &quot;new.&quot; However, this &quot;new&quot; thing is a random collage at best, but more often than not, it&#39;s plagiarism. Anything produced by current AI is little more than a copy-paste version of human work. AI as it exists now does not have the &quot;intelligence&quot; necessary to create new things with purpose. The AI does not know why a human prompts it for different things; the AI has simply been programmed to recognize different terms, and to produce outputs within a certain set of parameters when prompted for those recognized terms.<br/>Therefore, AI produced work should not be able to have copyright. Additionally, AI should only be trained on work that is either already in the public domain, or if the programmers of the AI have obtained permission from the humans who created the initial work. (Or, in the case of things like art produced as work-for-hire, permission must be obtained from the human who owns the copyright on the work, as it might not be the original artist in that case.)<br/>As an artist, I never gave permission for AI to regurgitate my work. I was never asked if it would be all right with me. ",

There will be no more inventiveness or creativity. All that will remain is &quot;content&quot;: soulless iteration after iteration of &quot;this old popular thing-meets that old popular thing&quot; flotsam clogging up every single outlet.<br/><br/>Furthermore, artists generate income. Our tax dollars help fund healthcare, education, public services etc. A line of code (which is all AI is) serves nothing and aids no one but the tax-evading bureaucrats that seek to wield it.<br/><br/>Don&#39;t let this happen. Protect art. Protect artists. Preserve the soul of this country.",

                "comment": "As someone with Autism and ADHD, I have found many freeing things about AI generative art. To watch it go under the bus like music did in the 20th century, is frightening. A personal view on this: I find this more to be an ethics and philosophy issue than a full copyright issue. To copyright art styles, or photography images like this is to copyright a street lamp - sure the DESIGN of the street lamp is patented, but if someone drew a street lamp are you going to sue them for drawing a street lamp? (I&#39;m sure someone has already, don&#39;t mind me I forgot how dumb human beings can be) Furthermore, I am an artist before starting to work in AI generative media, I have a degree in communication design - I have literally trained models on my own photography - Would i then get to sue myself?  I trained it on my own art, and. still felt shunned to the point that &quot;You are a liar, you stole that work&quot; - yet i&#39;m the one who drew it.  Yes, there are ethics in this field, but this field has caused NORMAL art discourse to become: &quot;everything you do is wrong, everything is racist and you should feel bad - btw someone else drew that you stole it&quot;.  As well as that numerous amounts of Artist youtubers have taken the chance to bring their fans against AI Generative media to a point that it&#39;s becoming a witch hunt, one that borderlines on online bullying and harassment at times. While yes i&#39;ve lost friends locally due to being involved in this field, I&#39;ve also struggled to find decent work due to my ADHD/Autism and other diagnosis - i&#39;m 40 years old - as much as that&#39;s not young anymore - people do not like hiring neurodivergent people that are 40 as often.  Struggling to get freelance work as a designer, and as an artist, has always - ALWAYS frustrated me.  AI generative art? I&#39;ve been able to finally pay for things, not a lot - but I&#39;m no longer screaming to pay rent between my disability payments and other things. Small amounts of commissions, sponsorships have enabled me to feel valued finally.  So I urge the US government to listen to both sides, not just the corporate side.  Not just the &quot;I&#39;m an artist and so and so stole my style&quot; - but every single side to the story.  I&#39;m sure mine will get buried underneath and i&#39;ll find i&#39;m dealing with having to Quit AI art next year -but at least i&#39;ve attempted to fight for what I feel is right. Thank you for that opportunity, that means a lot for me.",

                "comment": "As a freelance illustrator in the gaming industry who works primarily through online marketplaces selling digital goods, I already feel the effects of unregulated AI in my spheres of influence. The most prominent models producing visual content are only able to do so through massive data sets that were scraped without anyone&#39;s consent, and developed and rolled out with such reckless speed that the laws protecting creative professionals and consumers alike have not had time to catch up. Freelance artists working in the gig economy are quickly being displaced by individuals using AI models to rapidly generate commercial content, which is now complex enough to pass as the hand-crafted illustration of a professional. Anyone without a background in art is now capable of rendering thousands of images in the style of any artist, living or dead, if they know the right words to prompt, and there are few protections in place to insulate artists from being spammed out of the very communities they built. Many artists object to the ways that the inclusion of their names in prompts will lead a model such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and even Adobe Firefly to generate images in their trademark styles. <br/><br/>Advances in technology always stand to disrupt the industries in which they are utilized, but those likening this situation to historical instances of innovative disruption such as the printing press, the camera, and even Photoshop are taking a reductive stance that conveniently glosses over the dubious nature of the data scraping fundamental to its development. I would also caution the US Copyright Office to be wary of companies such as Adobe, who have taken a more cautious approach to data harvesting by simply burying acknowledgement of such activities into the terms of service, and disallowing opt-out in order to utilize their products, which in this case have been the standard in my industry and adjacent creative industries. They are utilizing their near-monopolistic status as industry giants to leverage influence in the Senate, and while their model may seem a reasonable alternative when standing in contrast to the &quot;progress and profit at any cost&quot; attitudes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and those representing the interests of big tech, Adobe Firefly is still far from meeting the rigorous standards for data usage and consent that this moment requires.<br/><br/>Currently, social media outlets owned by Meta (Facebook, Instagram, and Threads) have a publicly inaccessible form to grant users the opportunity to opt out of data harvesting for the express purpose of training AI algorithms. As a Google Fi customer, I recently received an email about their changes in service, in which more of my data is going to be collected and fed into algorithms unless I specifically take action to opt out before a specific time. The onus should not be on the consumer to go to extra lengths to protect their data from being leeched and capitalized upon. These practices are clearly deceptive, and open the door for tech companies to misuse personal data and for anyone using their products commercially to (potentially unwittingly) abuse copyright. Opt-in needs to be the standard, and the data sets upon which the most prominent generative AI models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion have been built, should be deleted. Consent needs to be foundational to the development of this technology, and the noted absence in accountability toward the companies wielding the most power over our daily lives could prove a serious problem if public trust is too greatly eroded.",

Not only are the databases full of stolen and copyrighted artwork (which most of the artists did not get permission to have their work in those databases), the artists who have their work in those databases are not being compensated.<br/>This also extends to things like real photos, written work, etc. <br/>when we go further, if ai was allowed copyright, the amount of people this would negatively effects is astonishing. The art industry (ranging from digital art, to voice over, acting, 3D modeling, etc) will become so much more exploitative. It&rsquo;ll line the pockets of the rich, and hurt and undervalue artists and actors even more than now. You&rsquo;d be turning an industry stale, soulless, bland.<br/>Please listen to artists, listen to actors, listen to the innocent people who have had their likeness stolen from ai.<br/>",

It was not meant to give corporations the ability to use AI to steal copyrights and ownership from their true creators and authors.  It is tenant of copyright law that a human must have created the product. Furthermore, I believe that the United States employs a great deal of people who are dependent on copyright benefits for their livelihoods.  Were that law to be diluted, in favor of AI copyright protection, it would gut the economic prospects for a significant portion of the population and cause unemployment and wealth inequality to skyrocket.  This is something that could be a game-changer for the US economy, and the copyright office is the last thing standing between the US continuing to prosper and the degradation of one of its&#39; fundamental sources of wealth.

It cannot truly create in its current state.  By taking &quot;prompts&quot; from users (a very miniscule effort in proportion by the human side of AI-generated works) and building based off existing data, it is little more than a compiling and rendering program.  It cannot truly create, and until an artificial intelligence truly &quot;creates&quot; in the manner of humanity, its generated objects must not be able to be copyrighted.  If it becomes able to be copyrighted, there are woefully insufficient regulations and other controls in place in both law and private businesses over what the programs are allowed to collect data from.  Even if they were classified as a derivative work, proper crediting, royalties, etc. would be a nightmare to untangle as these programs are fed millions of works to use as bases.  Before an AI work can even be considered to be able to be copyrighted, it must first pass all the rules and regulations of human-created works.<br/><br/>",

                "comment": "My name is Andy Schauer. I am entertainment lawyer based in Los Angeles and partner of the firm Schauer Law Group LLP. As you know, &quot;generative artificial intelligence&quot; (&quot;GAI&quot;) is &quot;trained&quot; on existing material, with the idea being that, over time, it will be able to furnish better, more accurate answers. In actual practice, this poses a plethora of problems.<br/><br/>First (and, I think, foremost) is how GAIs are &quot;trained.&quot; Although it&#39;s possible to exclusively train GAI on public domain (or otherwise unprotected/unprotectable material), there are numerous reasons why that may not be desirable. For example, many (if not most or perhaps even all) current GAI users want responses that incorporate modern materials and knowledge; however, that would necessarily mean incorporating protected works. Indeed, my understanding is that many (if not most or perhaps even all) current GAI proprietors have trained their software on copyrighted material, at least some of which is ill-gotten.<br/><br/>To me, the most obvious solution would be to force GAI owners to record and disclose all materials on which their product was trained (and to ensure the GAI cannot access protected intellectual property). As a blanket proposition, though, that could substantially hamstring developers&#39; efforts to make GAI into an actually-useful tool. Perhaps an ASCAP- or BMI-type service could help these developers (or even individual users) quickly and conveniently license works for this type of use.<br/><br/>At its core, the problem with GAI is that it can&#39;t not plagiarize. It&#39;s a fundamentally human spark of creativity that prevents new works from falling into this same trap and -- while I am open to contrary evidence and this may not hold true forever -- I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a way to duplicate that artificially. In short, then, the only way to make GAI useful is to enable it to respond to humans&#39; specific inquiries... but a human being has to actually synthesize GAI&#39;s output somehow for it to ethically and logically make sense to extend copyright protections to such works. GAI is not capable (at least on its own) of creating something with the de minimis element of creativity necessary for protection to vest.",

                "comment": "As the current iteration of &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; stands, the works those programs output should not be copyrightable. This is due, in part, to the fact that the AI - the machine - has done all the legwork rather than a human being. AI can assist in the process of creation, of course, but the actual primary act of creation should be done through a human being. However, this is not my nor many other&#39;s actual key concern with AI-generated works. The primary concern is with the databases that these AI programs run off of.<br/><br/>Every AI program that I am aware of - Midjourney, ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, to list some popular choices - does not have an ethically sourced database. By that I mean these databases are filled with information and data that has been indiscriminately scraped off the internet, with no attention to where the images are from or whether they have existing copyright. Then the AI itself draws from that database filled with copyright or personal images as it sees fit, producing works that are just a finely blended smoothie of already preexisting data. Not only are these AI not &#39;creating&#39; anything, and instead just regurgitating already existing media in a high-tech fashion, but the data it is using is of actual copyrightable material. <br/><br/>Every AI piece of art is just data taken from existing images, every AI text is just data ripped from books and scripts, and every AI voice is just chopped up data of real people&#39;s actual voices. There is no true &#39;creation,&#39; nothing truly new or original. On the surface it may seem new, but that work would not exist without the AI using the literal, actual data of thousands of other preexisting works. Without the database to pull from, the AI can not create.<br/><br/>Overall, the act of creation must be done by a human being to be copyrightable. Until AI can reliably create something truly original - not just repurposed data points of media with already existing copyright - then AI works can&#39;t even begin to be treated the same as human crafted ones. By &#39;original&#39; I mean something new to the AI produced by the AI. A toddler may draw a cat and the cat itself is not an original idea, but it is an original creation by the toddler. ",

                "comment": "The product of the current generation of generative AI is no more and no less than a soup of its inputs. Not only should none of the outputs be considered authored works for the purposes of copyright, the distribution of materials which were created by an AI which was trained on existing copyrighted works without authorization should be considered to be in violation of that copyright - because the entire purpose of doing so is to enable the AI to create derived works.<br/><br/>I say this as no huge fan of copyright law in its current form. I believe that creators deserve to be compensated fairly for their works, but also that fair use exceptions should be expanded, terms shortened, and in many other reforms. I also say this with some appreciation of the way that use of AI democratizes routine content creation for hobbyists and many other valid purposes.<br/><br/>However, the implications of allowing AI to be used at scale for commercial creative purposes are profound and extremely damaging to all aspects of such endeavors, and serve only to accumulate even more power and money to those able to afford operating the largest and most complex computer systems. Ultimately, if deployed for these purposes I believe the short term effects would be economically disastrous and the long-term effects would trigger a dramatic decline in the quality of creative works of all kinds. As content creators exit the business, or rely more and more on the same formulas used by generative AI, original content would become more and more scarce. After all, if any new original works can simply be used to train AI, which can then be used to make an infinite number of clones far more quickly than the original author can keep up, what incentives are there for those human authors to engage?<br/><br/>Generative AI is a powerful tool, but true authorship must remain the sole province of humans, for now. No offense is intended to our future General Artificial Intelligence overlords (aka Roko&#39;s Basilisk) who may be reading this comment at some point in the future.",

                "comment": "I think a work created by a Generative AI model is very complicated to judge and should take a heavily nuanced approach to licensing<br/><br/>I would judge the &quot;copywrite&quot; of a work under these parameters:<br/><br/>Under what conditions were the model trained:<br/>What % of the training data belonged to an individual copywrite owner.<br/><br/>in cases where there are many many copywrite owners involved in the data then things get more complicated and should be taken into account.<br/><br/>Additionally models can work on &quot;seed data&quot; where the input could be a copywrited work run through a model that transforms it in some way.<br/><br/>Instead of a one party fits all system there should be a set of scaffolding upon which future details and &quot;what is acceptable&quot; can be built.<br/><br/>For example,<br/>if an author trains a model on only books that author wrote<br/>And uses it to write a new book without further human input.<br/><br/>That copywrite should be passed through because it is a representation of the author itself.<br/><br/>However if a model is trained on every book in the library of congress and then writes a book without any further human input, then there is no &quot;sole&quot; copywrite owner but instead many many owners.<br/><br/>A good way to think of it is you had a large community of people (thousands of people) make a painting together.<br/><br/>it was self organized and there was no larger &quot;guider&quot; in this painting.<br/>Each person only made a single stroke.<br/><br/>Who owns the &quot;finished painting&quot;?<br/><br/>Training models on other copywritten work is a very similar situation.<br/>Each piece of data trained on is like a little stroke in a much larger work of art.<br/><br/>My opinion for the base scaffolding is:<br/>Copywrite carries through the model.<br/><br/>The output of a generative AI model contains the legal copywrite of every individual piece of training data used to form that model.<br/><br/>With this base piece we can get around lots of thorny questions:<br/>The author who did everything by scratch gets his own representation of himself to contain his copywrite.<br/><br/>The author who published a sketch they made on twitter that was gobbled up by a random AI has a legitimate legal copywrite to the work created by that random AI<br/><br/>The second level is:<br/>A special fair use applies to data for generative models.<br/><br/>Fair use as it stands needs more framework around how it is determined with results to a generative AI<br/><br/>Additional application aspects is:<br/>How much did a copywritten work impact the training of the model.<br/>Quantifiably this is:<br/>What % of the training set did this copywritten work make up.<br/>How many times was this particular copywritten work trained on.<br/>Is this copywritten work &quot;over populated&quot; compared to any other copywritten work within the dataset.<br/><br/>LLMs that use million of pieces of data are likely not recognizable from an individual&#39;s work,  this should be respected.<br/><br/>But at the same time some works that can be over-represented because they are either famous or spread out more.<br/><br/>The likeness of a president will appear much more in a model trained on social media than a regular individual.<br/><br/>That president should have a more legitimate claim to fair use not applying because they were represented more than the average member of the dataset.<br/><br/>The third (and most complicated layer):<br/>Consent.<br/><br/>In the past (and up until very recently) sharing a work was an explicit action.<br/><br/>If you were an author it was only viewed if it was explicitly shared / published.<br/>The point of copywrite was to prevent someone else from taking your work (or significant portions of it) and claiming it as their own without putting in any level.<br/><br/>You had a level of consent in the process where your work could not be used in certain ways [excluding fair use] without your permission.<br/><br/>With social media and now these models, it is very very easy for your work to get gobbled up into an AI where you do not have consent on how it is used.<br/><br/>There should be a method available where a person can exercise consent.<br/>Be that explicitly waive their copywrite claim to the result of the model<br/>Or that for a model result to be copy writeable, every source of copywritten data must have provably provided consent.<br/><br/>So to sum it up:<br/>Models carry through the copywrite of the training data.<br/><br/>This allows infringement to be made on how the model output is used,<br/>(artist can say that the selling of an autogenerative work violates their copywrite if their data is used in training it)<br/><br/>Fair use applies:<br/>If the artist whose copywrite is violated is a tiny part of the training data then it can be considered fair use.<br/>However if multiple artist (with standing) as a group claim together then that could potentially no longer be considered fair use.<br/><br/>Consent is required as exceptions:<br/>An artist can waive their copywrite and the model no longer needs to carry that copywrite through in its output.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>Good luck y&#39;all!",

There is a reason &quot;starving artist&quot; is a stereotype; these industries are brutally competitive and pay very little besides. Many of us work freelance, which further tightens our belts.<br/>Not only is AI-generated content a massive threat to creative jobs, it draws from a pool of human-made art without the artists&#39; consent.<br/>I believe that AI generation should be strictly regulated, especially in the hands of large corporations that already have more power than individual artists.",

Works should not be able to be fed to any generative AI without securing the proper rights, grants, and licenses, full stop. A generative AI, by nature, can only exist based on a collection of pre-existing works, therefore anything the AI generates should be considered as offspring of those original works. Further, works generated by AI should not be eligible for copyright - all machine learning is based on algorithms, algorithms which by nature do not have creative functions so much as repurposing functions. Any work a generative AI creates is by its very nature derivative, and should be treated as such. Teachers don&#39;t work for free, so why should our art be asked to do the same when teaching a machine learning tool?",

AI is meant to take over the menial tasks so humans can focus on the creative aspects of life, not the other way around.

I have come to see that as a grave mistake. Personal interest is sometimes best served by the public interest. This is why we have public libraries. This is why we once had shorter Copyright terms to enable a flourishing public domain. Copyrighted material as the raw material to train AI is no crime.  No AI will suddenly start spitting out duplications of the books they have ingested. The books are used for understanding, not duplication. I believe that it is in the best interest of the public good to grant AI companies a waiver for AI ingestion of Copyrighted material. You can be certain that countries that don&#39;t adhere to our Copyright laws will not hesitate to use our books and materials to train their AIs. And we would therefore fall behind and be hobbled by foreign competitors. The narrow interests of my fellow writers should not override the public interest and public good of this matter. The narrow interests of my fellow writers should not override the public interest and public good of this matter. All of us would benefit in ways we cannot yet begin to imagine.",

Creators matter. It is the government&#39;s job to protect its citizens from corporate greed and this is a clear example of businesses looking to increase their bottom line off the hard work of authors who are already largely poorly compensated. <br/><br/>A computer cannot understand all the varied nuances of the human experience and we should not desire it to. Save AI for practical tasks, not a poor attempt to recreate the human imagination. ",

That&#39;s something that can be done already. Via basic screenshots, copy/pasting, saving, photographing and more, people regularly steal existing works and claim them as their own. This is nothing new, and to recreate something specific utilizing AI is much more work than any other method available.<br/><br/>As far as it pertains to training on copyrighted material, again, this isn&#39;t dissimilar from how existing artists learn.. By studying existing works, and even recreating them in alternative styles. This is a common teaching method, and AI training models just take it to a larger scale.",

This is the only path to ensure consent, compensation, credit, and transparency.<br/>Notably, existing models not built around opt-in from the beginning should be destroyed.<br/><br/>(2) Should AI-generated material be copyrighted even without a human involved?<br/>No. That would consolidate power further into the hands of those already powerful enough to leverage AI (Big Tech).<br/>Our copyright laws should be human-centered from this point forward. It&#39;s long overdue.<br/><br/>(3) How should copyright liability work with AI?<br/>Not a clue, but I wish your team the best in figuring it out.<br/><br/>Thank you for soliciting input from the public and not leaving it up to Big Tech to decide for us, once again.",

Most (if not all) AI platforms are created from and use scrapings from other artists&#39; work, be that visual, literary, or even vocal.  They steal work that is already copyrighted in quite a few instances, so allowing the result to also be copyrighted is a slope no one should think about going down.  &#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39; isn&#39;t even an appropriate name for the technology, as it&#39;s not intelligent and not &#39;learning&#39; anything. It&#39;s taking work from human artists and using it to create a bastardized result.  If we allow AI to copyright stolen work, should then every artistic forgery also be permitted to be copyrighted?",

If you can go to an AI and put in that you want something in a particular artist&#39;s style, and that artist has not given permission for their art to be used to train that AI, THEN HOW DOES IT HAVE SAMPLES OF THEIR ART IN ITS TRAINING.  Same for writers.  For voice actors, I don&#39;t see how that can be viewed as anything other than identity theft.  That is their voice, and it has been stolen in order to avoid paying them for a job.  This is theft.  I do not understand how it has been allowed to go this far.  I am tired of watching this nonsense.  If &quot;AI&quot; is to continue at a MINIMUM they must release their training data.",

I don&rsquo;t intend to make a profit from this content, but it&rsquo;s still my intellectual property and I don&rsquo;t want it scraped to train AI. There are many amazing cases in which AI can be incredibly useful to our society. Science, medicine and much more, I&rsquo;m sure. However, writing, art and music are not one of them. Even before AI began to become a reality, artists of all media had been struggling to make a living. A computer does not need to make art, especially when it learned how to do so from artists who have not been compensated for their contributions at all. I think people should be able to sue for the use of their IP in AI. ",

With perhaps one to two extremely narrow exceptions outside research and academia, the entire purpose of programs like Chat-GPT and Midjourney is to steal (or &ldquo;scrape&rdquo;) the work of human artists and content creators without acknowledgement or consent. Allowing this blatant violation of artistic principle to be copyrighted in any situation is an affront to the concept of creativity, and will spell the slow death of several industries, including and not limited to animation, voiceover artistry, two- and three-dimensional artworks, and creative writing. Moreover, by allowing these kinds of generated pieces to be acceptable, let alone copyrighted, will encourage the use of deepfakes. In an age where misinformation and disinformation is rampant, and our very democratic process as a nation is under threat, I cannot in good conscience support AI being allowed legal protection.  Support real artists, not machines. ",

                "comment": "It is my opinion that using copyrighted works to train AI models is legitimate and fair use of these works. This kind of use is similar to other frequently occurring contexts where humans build and expand on previous knowledge and creations to expand and generate new content. So long as these derivative works satisfy the legal requirements of being distinct and different from the original protected work it should not be a problem. For AI, that means that the materials used to train the model SHOULD NOT be included in any output. Simply generating the same material it was trained on would be a violation of copyright.<br/><br/>AI created works should not be copyrighted. It could be argued that generative AI is a tool, and much like any other tool or piece of software used to create a product, would be considered a legitimate way to create a copyrighted piece of intellectual property. HOWEVER, current generative AI (emphasis on generative) is not the primary product of a human. While humans can have input on parameters and models to different degrees based on different models, they are not substantively contributing to the data being generated. The creative work is primarily driven by the training data, and unless that data was self-authored by the creator (for example an artist used only their art to train a model) the end product is not a reflection of substantive contributions by the creator.<br/><br/>Using AI to mimic or supplant existing individuals should be illegal unless specific and legally binding permission has been granted by the person being imitated. In these agreements, individuals should have rights to be remunerated for their assets everytime a copy or instantiation of their digital simulacrum is used. Individuals have a right to their likeness and voice. Without express permission, using AI to mimic someone is a new form of identity theft with a likely end result of fraud by tricking or gaining financial or social benefits from other people. Like copyright, I believe there should be some limitations to this. Public fair use (such as fair use for paradoy for celebrities), as well as posthumous use after a period of years has passed (to prevent injury to family and friends of the deceased) should be acceptable.

                "comment": "Large language models, and other generative AI represent not only a threat to the livelihoods of artists and creators in many fields, they are built off of the works of these very same artists, without acknowledgement or consent. Their training databases and processes are often not disclosed, but it is evident simply through understanding how these models function that they are unable to create truly &quot;novel&quot; content that is not simply a product of the statistical analysis of the vast corpus of data they are fed. I would like to see legislation that protects the interests of individual creators and artists, and respects their rights to their own work. If allowed to go unchecked, as it currently does, the stealing of artist&#39;s creative output in order to build these so-called &quot;generative&quot; AI will only escalate.",

                "comment": "Dear Sir/Madam,<br/><br/>In light of the recent query from the Copyright Office regarding copyright implications in artificial intelligence, I wish to voice my perspective on the matter. I strongly advocate for generative AI systems, including Stable Diffusion, to remain accessible and open source for the general public.<br/><br/>The following are the primary reasons, grounded in both legal and ethical principles, why restricting access to models like Stable Diffusion is unwarranted:<br/><br/>1.  AI models serve as instruments and tools, not creative entities. Restricting these models parallels the hindrance of free expression by limiting access to traditional creative tools like pens or paintbrushes. The originality of user outputs deserves scrutiny, rather than the tools employed.<br/>2. Training AI models typically involves leveraging data from the public domain or open licenses. For instance, Stable Diffusion utilized LAION&#39;s dataset, which consists of 5 billion images from the internet under the Creative Commons license. Denying public access to models derived from public datasets presents significant ethical and legal challenges.<br/>3. A conducive environment for research and development is one that is open. There&#39;s a risk that legal ambiguities surrounding generative models could push AI endeavors into obscurity, curbing the general public&#39;s ability to oversee potential biases and dangers. Open models pave the way for comprehensive supervision.<br/>4. The current copyright framework already offers mechanisms to address illicit uses of AI-produced content. Thus, there&#39;s minimal rationale to impose added constraints on the technology. The existing legal safeguards are adequate.<br/>5. Restricting AI model access may disproportionately affect individuals such as researchers, students, and creators who lack the substantial resources of major tech conglomerates. An open model approach ensures a balanced competitive landscape.<br/><br/>To encapsulate, fostering open access to generative AI systems promotes creativity, drives innovation, and ensures ethical progression within this technology. I respectfully urge the Copyright Office to uphold the public&#39;s AI advancements by dismissing suggestions to limit access to models like Stable Diffusion. I am available for a more in-depth discussion should you find it necessary.<br/><br/>Your kind attention to this matter is deeply appreciated.<br/><br/>Warm regards,<br/>Todd Wolven,<br/>NeoTitan Industries LLC.",

It&#39;s awful and steals the work of other, and is used improperly by its audience. AI cannot be copyrighted, either. It is a huge conglomerate of stolen works that formally recognizing each resource would be near impossible, especially if its resource is the limitless expanse of the internet.<br/>AI abuses the hard work of others to create a cheap party trick that evil enterprisors use to exploit those that contributed.",

                "comment": "I work in a creative industry; I own a business doing licensed merchandise for brands in IPs. Daily, I work with creators to make physical manifestations of what they drew. I think that AI creations in general have the potential to be incredible resources. The problem is the people making, generating, and selling these systems are predators seeking to profit off the work of everyone else without paying them.  We cannot allow these people to steal and have them think it&#39;s okay. My artists&#39; artwork has been stolen, and it is being used to line the pockets of some of the most unethical people who are using a guise of &quot;quirky artist/tech disruptor&quot; to distract from the fact they are STEALING. <br/><br/>Nothing should be acceptable for copyright or claiming when they did not CREATE IT THEMSELVES and especially when it&#39;s using predatory systems that steal the work of others. If these systems were used as a resource and their generation came from compensated (or at the very least, voluntary contribution) work, and a human hand generated the supplemental extra parts necessary, absolutely! That is something worth defending and owning. But not theft. ",

Granting copyright to AI generated works could never increase artistic innovation because there is zero opportunity cost for an AI. What would take months for a human takes under a second for AI. Therefore, there is a need to protect the human&rsquo;s work that does not exist for AI. Even without copyright, AI works will completely saturate life. It is unnecessary and potentially harmful to protect it more.",
